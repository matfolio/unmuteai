Don't be fooled by Brotherhood's cunningly familiar disguise. Mark it as a fresh target pounce and take it down. [January 2011 p66]

Pikmin 2,GameCube,Aug-30-2004,Nintendo,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,Stuff,100,Flat-out weird does not begin to describe this highly addictive title.

A fat little purple child with a flower budding out of his forehead.
Okami HD,PlayStation 3,Oct-30-2012,HexaDrive,Fantasy | Fantasy | Action Adventure | General,Gaming Age,100,Overall Ōkami HD is an experience that should not be missed.

Sid Meier's Civilization V,PC,Sep-21-2010,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | Historic | 4X,The Escapist,100,My favorite Civilization to date.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2012,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Tactics,Toronto Sun,100,By virtue of how it stokes more parts of my brain than any game of the past decade I’m inclined to consider XCOM: Enemy Unknown one of the most important titles of this generation.

Verdun,PC,Apr-28-2015,M2H | Blackmill Games,General | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Arcade,GameWatcher,90,Much like the conflict that the game shares its namesake with Verdun is a ferocious and tense multiplayer shooter the likes of which we haven’t seen in a long time.
Dungeons 2,PC,Apr-24-2015,Kalypso,Strategy | General,Gamer.nl,85,Dungeons 2 is a colorful strategy game like Dungeon Keeper.

BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode One,PC,Nov-12-2013,Irrational Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,games(TM),90,It’s an affectionately crafted homage to the first game retroactively building on the grim story and Ayn Rand-ian themes galvanising them with a fresh perspective whilst simultaneously tying Rapture more wholly into the Columbian narrative. It’s intelligent indulgent and nostalgic in equal measure left dangling on a transfixing narrative hook. It’s everything we love about BioShock condensed.

I figure that any time my complaints can be totally chalked up to user error that speaks volumes about how good everything else is — and it explains why I think that if youre looking for one Warriors game that shows everything the franchise does well without getting bogged down by any of its weaknesses Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires is the one to get.
Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session!,PlayStation 4,Nov-2-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Rhythm | Music,Video Chums,81,Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session! is focused on what makes the franchise enjoyable: its distinct take on rhythm gameplay. It may not have all sorts of extra mini-games and such but whats here is still a stellar entry in Namcos long-running series.
Magrunner: Dark Pulse,PC,Jun-20-2013,Frogwares,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,DarkStation,90,Magrunner: Dark Pulse is a great puzzle game that you might be tempted to dismiss as being unoriginal. If you make that mistake you will be cheating yourself out of a memorable experience.

Luminous Arc,DS,Aug-14-2007,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Tactics,RPG Fan,85,While this game will not end gamers quest for an irreplaceable Nintendo DS RPG it can certainly entertain them for 15-20 hours.
Gekido Advance: Kintaro's Revenge,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2003,Naps Team,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,TotalGames.net,89,The backdrops too are marvellous and the ancient Japanese feeling is matched perfectly with a slow and unsettling score. Whenever you are ambushed this is quickly replaced with an adrenaline-inducing rush of beats and youll find yourself dragon-punching in rhythm to the music.
Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller Episode 4 - The Cain Killer,PC,Sep-19-2013,Phoenix Online Studios,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,RPG Fan,85,Erica Reed is an engaging character: flawed but good-hearted and learning as she goes along — much like the game named for her. This was a trip Im glad I went on and one I advise any fan of adventure games to take for a spin.
Lumino City,PC,Dec-2-2014,State of Play Games,Adventure | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),100,An interesting game from all points of view. It amuses even those people who are normally not interested in games at all. [Issue#249]
Road Redemption,PC,Oct-4-2017,Dark Seas Games,Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,DarkZero,90,Overall Road Redemption is a brilliantly fun spiritual successor to the Road Rash series and absolutely exceeded my expectations. Its exhilarating and surprisingly tactical gameplay compensate for lackluster visuals and a few environmental collision issues. Road Redemption is an absolute blast to play and I thoroughly recommend it.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,PSP,Nov-15-2005,Electronic Arts,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,80,The execution of the magic spells and the top notch presentation makes this game a definite buy for Harry Potter fans and for those gamers looking for a simply fun title to pop into their lonely PSP.
Cubixx HD,PlayStation 3,Sep-20-2011,Laughing Jackal,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,ZTGD,85,Considering what you get for the price Cubixx HD is a worthy investment that offers up tons of challenging game modes in a package that not only looks great but plays great as well.
WRC 7,PlayStation 4,Sep-15-2017,Kylotonn,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,God is a Geek,80,WRC 7 is undoubtedly 2017’s most exciting rally game held back only by an overall experience that makes the same mistakes as its predecessor.
60 Parsecs!,PC,Sep-18-2018,Robot Gentleman,Adventure | General,GamingTrend,85,60 Parsecs is a simple game about not dying in space. While not complex in gameplay 60 Parsecs is incredibly deep with strategy problem-solving and smart resource planning. The game expertly blends a cartoonish and goofy world with some of the darkest elements of death and isolation. 60 Parsecs is a surprisingly fantastic game that has a large amount of replay value. It’s well worth a look.
Dandara,PC,Feb-6-2018,Long Hat House,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Hardcore Gamer,80,Dandara‘s seemingly-impossible feat at combining elements of platforming combat and strategy within its explorative template takes some doing and is almost an accomplishment in of itself.

Abyss Odyssey,PlayStation 3,Jul-15-2014,ACE Team,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Linear,Digitally Downloaded,90,Abyss Odyssey is a thematically deep game. On the surface its a simple action platformer crossed with roguelike but under that surface is a true rarity; a game made by South Americans that rejoices in South American mythology.
Evochron Mercenary,PC,Sep-17-2010,StarWraith,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Combat,BigPond GameArena,90,The important thing is this: this is a game made not just by a fan of the genre but by somebody who understands when something is fun... and when it needs to be cut entirely.
Sonic Classic Collection,DS,Mar-2-2010,Creative Assembly,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Compilation | Compilation | 2D,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,83,Its not a great port and wed have liked more content but the quality gameplay shines through.
Sacred 2: Fallen Angel,PlayStation 3,May-11-2009,Ascaron Entertainment GmbH | Ascaron Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Gaming Nexus,100,Sacred 2 is an excellent game that excels in many aspects while not doing anything terribly new or innovative for the genre.
Buzz! Junior: Jungle Party,PlayStation 2,Oct-2-2007,Magenta Software,Miscellaneous | Trivia / Game Show,VideoGamer,80,It looks pretty simple but its got a cuteness that will appeal to a wide range of players and enough mini-games to keep players interested for a good while.
Mosaic,PC,Dec-5-2019,Krillbite Studio,Adventure | General,The Indie Game Website,90,Mosaic is a cold game in which you strive to find even a shred of warmth. It fills you with a desire to be better to talk deeply to yourself and reassess your values. It doesn’t feel like a game exactly but more of an experience in empathy. Full of quirky dark humour that for once doesn’t come in the form of cringy dialogue and enriched with concepts that could make even the most steeled among us weep Mosaic does the heart some good.
Strider,PlayStation 3,Feb-18-2014,Double Helix Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamingTrend,90,This is one of the those rare times when a game was just made right and while you have every right to love it or hate it it’d have nothing to do with how it was made. This is an 80’s videogame power-ballad that hits all the right notes.
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition,PlayStation 2,Feb-18-2004,Edge of Reality,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamePro,90,Wrap up the tight gameplay in gorgeous graphics and solid sounds and Pitfall has never been better. [May 2004 p.69]

AirBlade,PlayStation 2,Jan-28-2002,Criterion Games,Sports | Alternative | Futuristic,Hot Games,90,Its a wild insanely challenging and great-looking game.
Batman: Vengeance,Xbox,Dec-18-2001,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IGN,82,Its a good game that truly engrosses the player into the role of Batman while demonstrating simple but well-designed gameplay mechanics.
Steel Soldiers,PC,Jun-14-2001,The Bitmap Brothers,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Command,GameSpy,88,A combat intensive 3D RTS that plays fast and smart with clever AI and an engaging story propelled campaign.
Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers,PC,Mar-28-2006,Pandemic Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,IGN,82,The multiple teams added tanks verticality precision fire the stepped-up AI and the much-needed multiplayer modes are all smart value-added features. The game doesnt however advance much once you get going.
Beat Hazard,PC,Apr-15-2010,ShadowRage,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,AtomicGamer,80,With some new social features online play or even some adjustments that more closely tie in the arrangement of enemies with the pace of the music Beat Hazards value could ascend well beyond the $10 asking price.
Mother Russia Bleeds,PC,Sep-5-2016,Le Cartel Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,God is a Geek,90,A debauchery-fueled beat ‘em up with plenty of ways to cripple your enemies its excessive violence never overshadows the smart and intuitive combat.
Beat Cop,Switch,Mar-5-2019,11 bit studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,COGconnected,84,I didn’t really have any expectations on Beat Cop when I first played it on PC back in 2017. Even two years later now on the Nintendo Switch it manages a quite pleasant surprise playing it. The story is quite addicting and I’m always eager to see what is next or even replay to see what else could have happened. Beat Cop is a pretty decent length as well and should clock in for most somewhere between seven and ten hours. The non-linear story along with the multiple endings means there is a good amount of replayability as well. All in all this is a great homage to 1980’s cop shows that shouldn’t be missed.
EA Sports UFC,Xbox One,Jun-17-2014,EA Sports,General | Sports | General | Individual | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,EGM,90,The best representation of the action that happens inside the Octagon yet. While it’s not simple the control scheme is still easy enough to learn that it takes the experience to an entirely new level as you break your opponents down standing up in the clinch or on the mat. With outstanding next-gen visuals EA Sports UFC is good enough to carry around a championship belt.
Democracy 3,PC,Oct-14-2013,Positech Games,Strategy | General | General,Gaming Nexus,88,The first glance at Democracy 3 can cause an immediate its too complicated reaction but the well-designed interface enables a fairly quick understanding of how to manage the policies required to create your own personal political utopia. For those that are into this kind of thing Democracy 3 is a great way to test pet political theories in a (mostly) consequence-free way.
SingStar ABBA,PlayStation 3,Dec-2-2008,SCEE London Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Playstation Official Magazine UK,90,In terms of doing what it says on the box SingStar Abba simply cant be faulted. [Jan 2009 p.99]
Anomaly Defenders,PC,May-29-2014,11 bit studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Sci-Fi | Defense,Softpedia,85,Anomaly Defenders is a good final hurrah for the tower defense series from 11 Bit Studios. It has gorgeous maps fun and hectic gameplay and a lot of strategic opportunities via the deployable powers and the complex tech tree. Whats more the difficulty modes that affect the layout of the maps are quite impressive.
Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Volume 2,PlayStation 2,Apr-8-2008,SNK Playmore,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Thunderbolt,90,Fatal Fury Battle Archives Vol. 2 is easily the best SNK anthology currently available.
Shrek the Third,DS,May-2-2007,Vicarious Visions,Action | General | General,PGNx Media,85,The game has a great presentation coupled with enjoyable combat and puzzles and good use of the touch screen.
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3,PlayStation 2,Mar-24-2004,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,3DAvenue,86,The developers have done a fantastic job porting the game except for a few graphics problems although the online play was surprisingly tolerable even with the servers in Europe.
Silent Hill HD Collection,PlayStation 3,Mar-20-2012,Hijinx Studios,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Horror | Compilation | Compilation,GamingXP,90,Brings back two of the very best horror games that have ever been published. The oppressive atmosphere of the games is as terrifying as ever and sadly so are the controls. James and Heather controls are just too clumsy. The graphics are much sharper and clearer now though Silent Hill 3 looks much better than its predecessor. The fact that there are new voice recordings is awesome because the synchronizations of the originals were pretty impersonal and static. All in all the collection is worth every cent though it is strange that Silent Hill and Silent Hill 4: The Room are missing.
Remember Me,Xbox 360,Jun-4-2013,DONTNOD Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Pelit (Finland),90,Remember Me is a technically accomplished and very stylish action adventure. The sci fi story about meaning of memories is interesting. [June 2013]
Graveyard Keeper,Xbox One,Aug-15-2018,Lazy Bear Games,Simulation | Action Adventure | Virtual | Open-World | Career,XboxAddict,85,Graveyard Keeper takes a proven but seldom used format of game and gives it the fresh twist that needs to feel wholly unique while not straying too far from the blueprints that would make it compelling. Maybe just maybe if you arent too attached to your yearly run through of Luigis Mansion or Resident Evil 4 for Halloween youll consider picking up Graveyard Keeper for something different. Or you could do it now... You should do it now.
Beyond: Two Souls,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2013,Quantic Dream,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person | Modern,Impulsegamer,100,Sure there are a few plot holes and clichéd moments in Beyond Two Souls but like Heavy Rain it may become one of your most memorable gaming experiences to date.
WWE Legends of WrestleMania,PlayStation 3,Mar-24-2009,Yuke's,Action | Sports | Fighting | Fighting | Individual | Wrestling | Combat | Wrestling,Worth Playing,88,Overall Legends of WrestleMania is the best romp through the WWE Ive had the pleasure of playing in years.
Crash of the Titans,PlayStation 2,Oct-4-2007,Radical Entertainment,Action | General,GamingTrend,84,It is commendable in a way since you know right from the outset that this is a game where you can just play. It is a lot of silly good natured fun that while not long in duration provides a good time.
Mercenary Kings,PlayStation 4,Apr-1-2014,Tribute Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical | Horizontal,Play UK,85,Deeper than it looks. [Issue#244 p.61]
Worms Battlegrounds,Xbox One,May-30-2014,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Artillery,ZTGD,95,I extremely enjoyed this game and it is definitely the best in the franchise that I have played. The story mode is brilliant and the new features and weapons improve the game play considerably. With online and offline multiplayer available too there is plenty of opportunity to play for hours. I was a little disappointed with the bugs that I encountered but in the end it did not take away from the fun of the game.
Ticket to Ride,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2008,Next Level Games,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,WonderwallWeb,89,I was very surprised at how good Ticket to Ride is and still go back to play it even after writing this review which is a rarity for me when it comes to Xbox Live games.
Cars,Xbox,Jun-6-2006,Rainbow Studios,Driving | Mission-based,WHAM! Gaming,90,What really leaves all the other modes in the proverbial dust though is the free-roaming aspect of Cars.
Wailing Heights,PC,Apr-27-2016,Outsider Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,GameSpew,80,So if you weren’t sure about the musical adventure genre you should be now. There may not be too much competition but Wailing Heights definitely belongs there as one of the genre’s greatest.
Pearl Harbor Trilogy - 1941: Red Sun Rising,Wii,Jul-5-2010,Arcade Moon,Action | Simulation | General | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,NintendoWorldReport,85,Red Sun Rising is one of the better WiiWare games released yet assuming you can adjust to the games awkward style of controls.
SimAnimals,DS,Jan-27-2009,Electronic Arts,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,WonderwallWeb,85,A surprise title that is hard to put down. It gets a bit samey later on but this is another great title aimed at the female market but worth a look for the blokes as well.
Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of WWII,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2007,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Games Master UK,79,Solid gameplay stunning aerial effects but nothing that will have you celebrating. [Oct 2007 p.82]
NFL Street 3,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,Armchair Empire,90,While EA will probably never make another Mutant League game of any sort NFL Street 3 ensures that the game of football can still be irreverent and entertaining at the same time.
Legacy of Kain: Defiance,PC,Dec-17-2003,Nixxes Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,IC-Games,90,A fantastic game that is let down slightly by an ill-designed camera system and lack of a map feature.
Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2007,Konami,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,GamesRadar+,80,Whats here is well polished and it works. Much like a favorite food the DDR series has settled into a comfortable groove. Perhaps the next outing will be a bit more daring.
The Council - Episode 2: Hide and Seek,PC,May-15-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,Game Debate,95,I lapped up all the skulking whispering skullduggery and a few of the plot twists caught me by surprise. I cant wait for more.
Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel,PlayStation 4,Feb-2-2016,Examu | Marvelous Inc.,Action | Fighting | 2D,Game Over Online,85,Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel is just the kind of well-crafted 2D fighter that the PS4 needs more of.
Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Apocalypse,Xbox 360,Aug-27-2013,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Arcade,Games Master UK,79,Origins a zombie-epic with giant robots rivals TranZit for thrills. [Dec 2013 p.63]
Fossil Fighters,DS,Aug-10-2009,RED Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | General,Worth Playing,92,The bottom line is that Fossil Fighters takes the formula established by games like Spectrobes and Pokemon and improves on it in nearly every way.
Sine Mora EX,Switch,Aug-8-2017,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,DarkStation,80,As a whole Sine Mora EX excellently interweaves the age-old time travel trope into both its complex paradoxical plot and unique time manipulation mechanics. And all seven levels are a spectacle hosting beautiful environments and impressive gigantic bosses. The ability to slow down bullet barrages combined with a fair checkpoint system makes it more approachable than others in the genre. Regardless most won’t get mileage outside of the main campaign which ultimately makes this a hard sell for anyone but enthusiasts. And although the Nintendo Switch edition has that trademark portability it’s tough to justify that higher price compared to other systems’ versions. Nonetheless it’s an exceptional experience that will offer hardcore shoot ‘em up fans a great time.
Citizens of Earth,PlayStation 4,Jan-20-2015,Eden Industries,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,90,As an adventure that does just about everything right in the fun and technical sense CoEs most valuable triumphs are its sense of humour and accessibility; whether you’re politically knowledgeable or oblivious and if you have a near-romantic relationship with turn-based RPGs you will risk yawning through a filibuster if it means becoming the Vice President of this world.
Call of Duty: Black Ops - Rezurrection,Xbox 360,Aug-23-2011,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,90,It seems that every new map pack gets progressively better or more interesting and a zombie-exclusive pack is a great way to keep Black Ops Zombie mode alive and kicking for a very long time while also giving fans who missed out on World At War a chance to experience that games incredible zombie offering.
Alice: Madness Returns,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2011,Spicy Horse,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamingExcellence,92,Alice: Madness Returns reminds me a lot of classic N64 platformers like Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie in the best of ways. By mixing a dark reimagining of a literary classic with stylish combat and rock-solid platforming EA and Spicy Horse have created a gaming experience quite unlike any other. At any rate its miles better than the lacklustre Tim Burton movie released last year. This is one rabbit hole worth tumbling down.
Batman: The Telltale Series - Episode 1: Realm of Shadows,PlayStation 4,Aug-2-2016,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Gaming Age,100,Batman has had many games over the years mostly trash and a few quite memorable. Telltale Games has knocked it out of the park and if episode one is any indication I see a solid contender for Game of the Year right here.
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3,Xbox 360,Mar-5-2013,CyberConnect2,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,IGN,86,Ultimate Ninja Storms reputation as Narutos most consistently enjoyable game series is safe.
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,PlayStation 4,Jul-31-2018,iNK Stories,Adventure | General,Worth Playing,90,As a whole 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a quick and blunt showing of an important piece of history thats made to be accessible to our generation. As a game the gameplay is straightforward but sometimes clunky the visuals are lackluster but portray what they must and the music bolsters the games chilling tone and narrative. There are some bugs in the visuals and longer load times but theyre minor hiccups when taking into account the games loftier goal of sharing this important piece of history with people who are largely unaware of it.
Warriors All-Stars,PlayStation 4,Aug-29-2017,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Digitally Downloaded,100,Warriors All-Stars is a delight. It’s explicitly a love letter to the Koei Tecmo faithful and it doesn’t pretend to be otherwise.
The Final Station,Xbox One,Sep-2-2016,tinyBuild | Do My Best Games,Action Adventure | General | Linear,Gaming Age,83,The Final Station doesn’t break any molds nor is it revolutionary in its gameplay or ideas but it is fun. It is good old fashioned quality fun.
Hydrophobia: Prophecy,PlayStation 3,Nov-1-2011,Dark Energy Digital,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,TheSixthAxis,90,Hydrophobia Prophecy on the PSN really is the best version. It looks and sounds great with water effects surpassing games with ten times the budget. Add in Move support that works well and a price of £5.10 and what we have is one of the PSNs best games.
Star Wars Galaxies: Episode III Rage of the Wookiees,PC,May-5-2005,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GameZone,85,While those who have not taken to the Jump to Lightspeed expansion may feel a little forced to do so (and make sure you have the right ship) the game combines new missions that drive the story and give players a much better sense of being part of the Star Wars universe.
Puzzle Agent,PC,Jun-30-2010,Telltale Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,The A.V. Club,100,Nelson Tethers is also smart enough to mock itself for the frequency with which puzzles unnecessary crop up: The hotel owner doesnt see anything odd in the fact that her assistant wrote your room key down in code but Tethers roll his eyes before rolling up his sleeves and tackling another puzzle.
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy - Episode 1: Tangled Up in Blue,PC,Apr-18-2017,Telltale Games,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,DarkStation,90,With four episodes left and this episode ending with one hell of a mystery left to solve with a villain hot on their tales I am looking forward to picking up with the Guardians to see where adventure takes them. Consider my interest also peaked for finding out how they eventually work Thanos back into the mix. Until then we’re left with a wonderfully solid first chapter that leaves me with the hope that Telltale’s best is still to come.
Rocket Knight,PlayStation 3,May-18-2010,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Game Revolution,91,A game like this is exactly what I wanted in the classic remake trend. Sure it doesnt bring much thats new but it does expand on all that makes this genre great and even better it brings back the memories of great games from years past.
Atelier Annie: Alchemists of Sera Island,DS,Oct-27-2009,Gust,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamingTrend,82,This is one of those pleasant surprises that sneaks up and grabs ahold of all your gaming time when you least expect it.
Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max'd,PlayStation 2,Sep-26-2006,Activision Value,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,TotalPlayStation,80,If youve played paintball in the past -- particularly in a tournament situation -- you may find even more to love here than most.
Tenchu: Shadow Assassins,Wii,Feb-5-2009,Acquire,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Gameplayer,90,Perhaps best of all though the developer has managed to create a graphically rich and detailed version of 13th Century Japan that’s positively dripping with atmosphere.
Metal Slug 7,DS,Nov-18-2008,SNK Playmore,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical | Horizontal,Game Chronicles,88,Metal Slug games tend to disappear fast and never return so snag this one fast and don’t be sluggish. If you see a sale bite and don’t hesitate.
Inazuma Eleven 3: Lightning Bolt,3DS,Sep-27-2013,Level 5,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Eurogamer Spain,90,The amount of content that Level-5 offers in this game is enormous and can last you for months.
Cars,PSP,Jun-6-2006,Locomotive Games,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,88,The racing gameplay is straightforward and although there are unlockables there isnt enough to increase the replay value score. The wireless multi-player mode will be the games only salvation in terms of replay value.
Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate,PlayStation 4,Feb-14-2020,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Player 2,83,There is quite frankly an overwhelming amount of content in Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate – while those upgrading from the base game may find it difficult to justify the cost outside of Infinity Mode there’s no question that anybody tossing up between the base Orochi 4 and Ultimate at this point should absolutely go with the latter.
Killer7,PlayStation 2,Jul-7-2005,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action Adventure | Modern,Play Magazine,90,Vile and bizarre refreshing and absorbing Killer7 is an aggressive blessing to cleanse us from the masses. [July 2005 p.70]

Strategic Command: European Theater,PC,Jul-16-2002,Fury Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,PC Gamer,90,Its the best grand strategy game since the 1993 classic Clash of Steel. [Nov 2002 p.138]

Project IGI: I'm Going In,PC,Dec-15-2000,Innerloop,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,GamePro,90,If you enjoy the idea of engaging covert-ops missions that require stealth and smarts more than sheer brawn youll love IGI.
F1 Championship Season 2000,PC,Nov-30-2000,Image Space Incorporated,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Formula One | Formula One | Automobile,Armchair Empire,94,A gateway game. It’s friendly enough for first time players but it’s got all the things to keep you playing and become a hardcore racer. (It’s even got options to show you the best trajectory and supply driving tips.) But even the hardcore simmer will find F1RC a challenge and realistic.

SingStar Pop Vol. 2,PlayStation 2,Sep-23-2008,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,PGNx Media,88,If you have a PlayStation 3 it may be better to pick up SingStar for PS3 since that game includes an online community where you can upload videos and download new songs. SingStar Pop Vol. 2 doesn’t include any of those features but as a multiplayer game it’s recommended as long as you like the songs.
Outbuddies DX,Switch,Jun-5-2020,Julian Laufer,Action | Platformer | 2D,GamingTrend,95,Outbuddies DX is the quintessential perfect game regardless of how you cut it.

Falcon Age,PlayStation 4,Apr-9-2019,Outerloop Games,Action Adventure | General,PlayStation Universe,90,Falcon Age is a unique and charming game that is equally as impressive on the PS4 as it is on PSVR.

Garfield's Nightmare,DS,Sep-4-2007,Shin'en,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gaming Nexus,81,Nothing about it is spectacular but it’s such a fun little platformer that I enjoyed it anyway.

MotoGP 09/10,PlayStation 3,Mar-23-2010,Monumental Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,VideoGamer,90,If you dont have a big interest in bikes or MotoGP this isnt for you. Theres nothing here for casual bike fans or anyone who might be on the look out for something accessible in the bike racing genre. Its an incredibly solid package though and one that fans will get a lot out of.
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3,Xbox 360,Oct-22-2006,Digital Eclipse,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,PGNx Media,89,Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is just as addicting as it was several years ago.

The Whispered World,PC,Apr-26-2010,Daedalic Entertainment,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Just Adventure,91,The Whispered World is about half a terrific game and half a mess. But since the most important parts the puzzling graphics and exploring are all well done Im going to ignore the stuff I cared less for and award the game an overall grade of A minus.
NCAA Basketball 09,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,TeamXbox,81,The revamped NCAA Basketball 09 does a nice job of giving bracketheads what they want despite some freshman jitters with its new engine. Even though NCAA Basketball 09 may not be a Final Four lock it’s clear that the franchise has a winning road ahead of it.
Below,Xbox One,Dec-14-2018,Capy Games,General | Action | General,CGMagazine,90,Below is a punishing dungeon crawler mixing elements from roguelikes Dark Souls and survival games to create an often painful yet oddly enticing action-adventure game.
Homefront,Xbox 360,Mar-15-2011,Kaos Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,XboxAddict,93,Combining so many elements into such a cohesive story THQ has reminded me why I love gaming. The only fault I could find other than the character models was the relatively short single player campaign; on the hard level I finished the game in less than 7 hours.
Tembo the Badass Elephant,Xbox One,Jul-21-2015,Game Freak,Action Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,90,Tembo the Badass Elephant is easily one of the most memorable releases of 2015 and hopefully the beautiful beginning of Game Freak branching out from Pokemon (and Nintendo) to deliver more pleasant surprises.
America's Army: Rise of a Soldier,Xbox,Nov-17-2005,Secret Level,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Yahoo!,90,We can think of few shooters that capture so well the dynamics of modern combat.

The only thing to criticize is the few changes in comparison with the last game.
Section 8: Prejudice,PlayStation 3,Jul-26-2011,TimeGate Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameWatcher,90,Its not perfect but we highly recommend this title to all FPS fans looking for something fresh to bide the time.

Fe,Xbox One,Feb-16-2018,Zoink!,Action | General,Digital Trends,90,Players who aren’t willing to relax a bit and let Fe take some control of their experience might have trouble but most everyone else will find an affecting unique romp through the woods backed by touching moments and some of the most inventive design to come from a major publisher in ages.
Coffee Talk,PlayStation 4,Jan-30-2020,Toge Productions,Adventure | Visual Novel,Digitally Downloaded,80,None of the characters or situations in Coffee Talk are simple or black-and-white. Rather the world is a beautiful complicated shade of grey. People arent good or bad theyre just trying to do their best. The message is hopeful. The pace is soothing. The music is well-suited to the environment. Coffee Talk really delivers on all fronts and even offers more game time post-story. Now its time for me to return to my customers I think the orc has arrived...

Little League World Series Baseball 2008,Wii,Aug-5-2008,Now Production,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Arcade | Arcade,GameShark,83,If the game only had a little more depth and online play it would be easy to recommend this without question.

Shadow Warrior,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,Flying Wild Hog,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Impulsegamer,85,Shadow Warrior on PS4 is a brilliant homage to what make the 90s video gaming world so entertaining!
Fairy Tail,PC,Jul-29-2020,Gust,Role-Playing | General,PC Invasion,80,A lot of anime games are full of personality but lack refinement and polish. Fairy Tail undermines those expectations by being well made whilst still capturing what made the original manga so special. Newcomers may find the limited retelling of the plot hard to follow but franchise veterans should have a blast.
Romancing SaGa 2,Switch,Dec-15-2017,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,80,This is one of the more unheralded Super Nintendo JRPGs but the update is of a high quality and while I don’t think it’s a classic example of the genre by any means it is still a very enjoyable game. A clean enjoyable combat system plenty of enemies to fight and a bit of exploration and puzzle solving on the side; this is the kind of classic JRPG experience that I’ll never get tired of.
Rainbow Moon,PlayStation 4,Feb-16-2016,SideQuest Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,4Players.de,83,New hardware same old game. But that is not necessarily bad. Story and characters could be more elaborate but classic turn based tactics drawn in appealing visuals is still as good as it always was.
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2,Xbox 360,Feb-25-2014,Mercury Steam,Fantasy | Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,Official Xbox Magazine,85,With a 20-hour runtime both it and the gameplay are prone to meandering and missteps but Lords of Shadow 2 nonetheless manages to bring the series crashing to a satisfying conclusion. [April 2014 p.70]

Cities XL 2011,PC,Oct-14-2010,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,My Gamer,88,Considering many of the missteps that the newer SimCity games have taken I am more than happy to say that Cities XL is more than able to contain the mantle of spiritual successor.
Sudden Strike 4,PC,Aug-11-2017,Kite Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Hooked Gamers,88,As my first entry into the series Sudden Strike 4 is one of those RTS games that Ill actually remember a year from now. One where Ill be sitting there and go Jeeze I think its about time to play it again. Im halfway tempted to go back and check out the older games but Sudden Strike 4s campaign is just something sublime that Im going to be revisiting frequently when I get the RTS itch. The shame is that I didnt enjoy the multiplayer as much as the single-player as while the gameplay mechanics stay intact it loses a lot of that luster. A final note: the campaign being only 21 missions along with the less enjoyable multiplayer may not be enough for many people to pay out the $49.99 price tag. Its a bit steep but I still say its a must play for any RTS fan.
CIMA: The Enemy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-17-2003,Neverland,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Nintendo Power,86,Hard-core RPG fans will enjoy the games nonlinear depth and detail. [Nov 2003 p.152]

Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2,GameCube,Oct-8-2002,Rainbow Studios,Sports | Alternative | Biking,Armchair Empire,80,Although the controls are responsive they’re far from easy to learn (even harder to master but less so if youve spent time with the other versions) especially if you’re just getting into the pool of extreme sports.
Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex,Xbox,Apr-15-2002,Traveller's Tales,Action | Platformer | 3D,Hot Games,90,Better on the Box.

For the latter its a chance to play one of the cult classics of last generation at its peak.
Shining Resonance Refrain,Switch,Jul-10-2018,Sega,Role-Playing | Action RPG,COGconnected,82,Shining Resonance Refrain plays like a pretty standard yet extremely solid JRPG. Despite the slow beginning the story is interesting and extremely well thought out. The characters are likable and the graphics are beautiful.
Elefunk,PlayStation 3,Jul-17-2008,8bit Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gamer.nl,80,Elefunk is a puzzle game with which both architects and normal gamers will have much fun. The building of bridges needs insight but are never impossible to solve. More levels would have been nice and we also had some trouble with framedrops. Anyway this game is well done.
Project X Zone,3DS,Jun-25-2013,Monolith Soft | Banpresto,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Tactics,Cubed3,90,Project X Zone shows how crossover games should be done celebrating the rich history of Namco Bandai SEGA and Capcom while making all the included characters shine.
The Angry Birds Movie 2 VR: Under Pressure,PlayStation 4,Aug-6-2019,XR Games,Puzzle | Action,GamingTrend,85,With simple asymmetric gameplay this game is great for kids of all ages and a worthy tie-in to the movie. While the unskippable trailer is a poke in the eye there’s nothing better than the cackling of a five year old while he mercilessly throws his would-be helpers around a submarine full of bombs.
Lost Planet: Extreme Condition Colonies Edition,PC,May-27-2008,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,80,There are plenty of new features that will entice fans back to the fold including new maps characters and single-player and online modes. My only complaint is the control system is sluggish to respond and can cause you to take a lot of unnecessary hits.
The Sims 4,PC,Sep-2-2014,Maxis,Virtual Life | Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual | Virtual Life,Vandal,90,Everything feels like a step forward even though there are some aspects (like random tutorials or some situations in which we felt completely out of control) that we would like to see more polished. Still a great choice for The Sims fans.
Assassin's Creed Unity,PlayStation 4,Nov-11-2014,Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Historic | Open-World,PlayStation LifeStyle,100,Unity doesn’t just play well it looks beautiful too. The graphics have a stunning painted quality to them that may be attributed to the way that different materials react to the lighting.
The Last Remnant Remastered,PlayStation 4,Dec-6-2018,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,100,It weaves a ripping yarn and has a beautifully detailed combat system that is endlessly rewarding to tinker with.
Pinball Hall of Fame - The Gottlieb Collection,Xbox,Nov-18-2004,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Pinball,Cheat Code Central,80,For a budget game it certainly is worth the price. While it can get very challenging at times the way the game feels and switches for each table is fantastic.
Guitar Hero: Aerosmith,PlayStation 3,Jun-29-2008,Neversoft Entertainment,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,PGNx Media,90,But ultimately how much you personally enjoy Guitar Hero: Aerosmith depends on how much you like the band.

Tarantino would be proud.
Maid of Sker,PC,Jul-28-2020,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action Adventure | Survival,Hooked Gamers,90,Maid of Sker doesn’t have terribly complex gameplay but it’s a tightly-made game that succeeds in more than enough areas to make it worth checking out. The Sker hotel is haunting filled with detail and character that makes it a joy to explore. The choral soundtrack is absolutely beautiful befitting both the game’s plot and atmosphere. Horror fans have been absolutely spoiled with high quality games over the last few years and genre fans would do well to add Maid of Sker to their list of must-plays.
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy - Episode 2: Under Pressure,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,Telltale Games,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,COGconnected,82,This episode has a good flow and tempo with lots of visually appealing cutscenes and action to break up the story and while it reaches the end without feeling rushed the cliffhanger feels a bit out of place.
Star Wars Battlefront: Outer Rim,PlayStation 4,Apr-5-2016,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Gameblog.fr,80,Outer Rim is an honest DLC offering beautiful cards a new and fun way and some attractive novelties. For holders of season-pass it is a very good opportunity to do it again. Indeed the content does not necessarily justify the 14.99 & euro;. Unless you are a big fan of Greedo or Nien Nunb. Its up to you.
Retrovirus,PC,Jan-31-2013,Cadenza,Action | Miscellaneous | General | General | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,DarkStation,80,Retrovirus is a great adventure and it gives you some insight into what your computer could be dealing with each day you use it.
Tomb Raider: Underworld,DS,Nov-18-2008,Santa Cruz Games,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,NintendoWorldReport,90,I wish there were other unlockables besides concept art (another problem shared with the console games) but at the end of the day Tomb Raider: Underworld on the DS is a great game that any DS owner would be silly not to at least try.
Thrillville: Off the Rails,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Frontier Developments,Strategy | General,Play UK,79,For short sharp bursts of Multitap action theres no better game than Off the Rails and its a decent crack in single-player too. [Issue#161 p.94]
Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy,PC,Sep-30-2007,Kheops Studio,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,83,But if you’re the type of gamer who enjoys a good logical mystery within a solid historical framework I predict you’ll have hours of enjoyment with Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy.
Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition,PC,Feb-17-2006,Midway,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,PC Gamer,90,For $19.99 this bundle is worth buying just for Off Road Thunder alone. [May 2006 p.102]
UFC Personal Trainer: The Ultimate Fitness System,Xbox 360,Jun-28-2011,THQ | Heavy Iron Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Official Xbox Magazine,90,I love how it combines hard training and unapologetic difficulty with the real-life personalities who serve as your trainers: much like the gymnastics coaches who saw me through days of torn palms and taped shins this tough-love attitude kept me focused and on track.

If you are however looking for a more serious game you might want to look elsewhere.
Resident Evil 0: HD Remaster,PlayStation 4,Jan-19-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,Game Informer,85,This HD remaster of Resident Evil 0 is an easy recommendation for anyone who enjoyed the original GameCube release and has enough patience to navigate the sometimes tedious inventory management.
TimeShift,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2007,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Worth Playing,85,Six months from now during the midst of the annual games drought in new titles shooter games no better than TimeShift will be favored by some if not many critics and will also sell well to a thirsty FPS audience. To significantly mark off this title right now would be if youll pardon the pun merely a matter of timing.
Prince of Persia: Rival Swords,Wii,Apr-3-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,88,If you havent played the Two Thrones and enjoy platforming mixed with fighting and puzzles dont miss this game; its a true masterpiece.
Call of Duty: Ghosts - Devastation,Xbox One,Apr-3-2014,Infinity Ward,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Critical Hit,80,A solid new addition to the Call of Duty experience and some of the best maps Ive played in a long time.
Nancy Drew: Danger By Design,PC,Jul-11-2006,Her Interactive,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Just Adventure,83,It’s not quite the best Nancy Drew game out there (I think that honor goes to Curse of Blackmoor Manor) but Danger by Design is just as fascinating as Minette and far less frustrating. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Nancy Drew and many who like adventure games.
RICO,Switch,Mar-12-2019,Ground Shatter Ltd.,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Pure Nintendo,95,If you’re a fan of either the Borderlands or Payday series this game is a must try for you.

Homefront,PC,Mar-14-2011,Digital Extremes,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,88,I love this game and despite a few forgivable flaws Homefront is easily one of the most immersive and emotional campaigns that come to mind in my 30 years of gaming. Sure the campaign is short. Deal with it. With that ending there is either going to be a sequel or some killer DLC. Meanwhile you can reap the rewards and satisfaction of some of the best multiplayer combat weve seen so far in 2011.
The Moment of Silence,PC,Mar-1-2005,House of Tales,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Four Fat Chicks,100,One of the best adventure games of 2004 and likely the best ever to deal with a futuristic Orwellian theme of corruption and conspiracy. Story dialogue character development settings artwork acting and music are all superb.
Vampyr,Xbox One,Jun-5-2018,DONTNOD Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Xbox Tavern,88,Vampyr is an ambitious experience that’s packed with atmosphere and personality. The game’s greatest achievement however is how well all of its systems come together to produce constant catch-22 dilemmas. It’s a game that truly puts the narrative power into the hands of the player which ultimately results in a deep and immersive journey through a dark and compelling plot.
Destroy All Humans!,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2020,Black Forest Games,Action Adventure | General,Finger Guns,90,This remake of Destroy All Humans! is really quite incredible.

The only thing to criticize is the few changes in comparison with the last game.
Tricky Towers,Xbox One,Sep-15-2017,WeirdBeard,Puzzle | Stacking,XboxAddict,75,Multiplayer is where Tricky Tower shines causing some hilarity at the best of times and anger directed towards your friends the other times. Sure you’ll get frustrated now and then as it’s sometimes hard to recover from a misplaced block but that’s where the challenge comes for this game. Tricky Tower is quite tricky to get the hang of as it takes some time learning and remembering the ‘half’ moves the blocks make and that these same blocks aren’t locked in place once they land. At the end of the day Tricky Towers can be an enjoyable experience especially if you’re craving some Tetris-like gameplay with a unique twist.
Pix the Cat,Xbox One,Feb-8-2017,Pasta Games,Action | Arcade,TheXboxHub,90,On the whole though and Pix the Cat is nothing short of adorable arriving with some of the best features ideas and supremely high production levels that can be found in an indie title. You may well initially think that both the Laboratory and Nostalgia modes are just tacked on extras to ensure more game time is thrown in but in fact you would be massively wrong with both modes more than capable of holding their own in the vast wilderness of the independent games scene.
Disney Universe,PlayStation 3,Oct-25-2011,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,82,The fun platforming inspired level design and bevy of character suits all make this a game worth experiencing.

Pid,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2012,Might and Delight,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,IGN,78,You can even play it with a friend. Just be aware that your game may lock up time to time; my PS3 froze twice while playing...For a downloadable game Pid provides a lot of bang for your buck.

The Fall Part 2: Unbound,Switch,Feb-13-2018,Over The Moon,Action Adventure | General,Switch Brasil,85,The Fall Part 2: Unbound is the best Puzzle game ever launched in the Switch eShop so far. Bringing such a good story makes the price paid worth it. The graphics are not ugly but it is also nothing special worth noting that it is visible the difference from portable to TV mode. The game is still divided into other genres which avoids repetition. The gameplay has minor issues with the characters targeting system but nothing that interferes too greatly with the gaming experience. It is highly recommended for fans of puzzles and a good story and can entertain you for several hours.

Its one of the most accessible MOBAs to date and doesnt feature the high barrier of entry that plagues so many of its contemporaries.

Heroes of Might and Magic V: Tribes of the East,PC,Oct-16-2007,Nival Interactive,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Pelit (Finland),83,A decent expansion to a good series. Innovative setting or exciting plot has not been Nival’s strong side previously and Tribes of the East is not an exception. It however is more enjoyable gaming for the warlord who hasn’t yet got his fill of the original game with familiar mechanics and a few new additions to make it feel fresh enough. Some scenarios feel a bit too restrictive at times a trait familiar from the earlier games too but not so much as to take much fun out of the game. Addition of campaign editor is good news but how the community makes use of it remains to be seen. [Jan 2008]

Did you like the first part? Or are you looking for a fine racing game then Test Drive Unlimited 2 is the one to get.

Yager,Xbox,Oct-5-2004,Yager,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Total Video Games,92,The design structure and implementation of this game are wonderful.

Alice: Madness Returns,PlayStation 3,Jun-14-2011,Spicy Horse,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamingExcellence,92,Alice: Madness Returns reminds me a lot of classic N64 platformers like Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie in the best of ways. By mixing a dark reimagining of a literary classic with stylish combat and rock-solid platforming EA and Spicy Horse have created a gaming experience quite unlike any other. At any rate its miles better than the lacklustre Tim Burton movie released last year. This is one rabbit hole worth tumbling down.

ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove,Xbox One,Mar-1-2019,Humanature Studios,Action | General,ZTGD,90,This game helped me understand why people love the original ToeJam & Earl so much. Back in the Groove basically renders the original obsolete. I would recommend it to any fan of the original and to anyone who wants a unique and less action packed game to play even more so if you have friends to play with. It will be exciting to see what’s next for the funk duo and their friends.

Mr. Shifty,PC,Apr-13-2017,Team Shifty,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameGrin,80,Mr Shifty is a hectic brawler that is enjoyable in short bursts. You can happily power through a few stages and feel like a badass while you’re doing it. It is however a short experience but there are enough challenges variety and enjoyment to be had. In contrast to Hotline Miami’s brutal difficulty you’d think Mr Shifty would be Hotline-lite but you’d be far from wrong as it can stand tall as being one of best top-down brawlers.
Richard & Alice,PC,Feb-21-2013,Denby / Raze,General | Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,80,Anybody interested in games with a narrative focus simply must give Richard & Alice a shot.
X-Men: The Arcade Game,Xbox 360,Dec-15-2010,Konami,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Planet Xbox 360,84,Its another dose of Konami arcade goodness with up to six players taking part in the over-the-top comic book action.

World War II: Frontline Command,PC,Jun-27-2003,The Bitmap Brothers,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General,Gamers' Temple,90,It was definitely interesting to play a game that to some extent had the look and feel of an Age of Empires yet with game play focused on mission accomplishment as opposed to strategic planning (i.e. no need to develop your trade economy or make sure you have enough lumber to build houses).
ATV Quad Power Racing 2,GameCube,Jan-22-2003,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Armchair Empire,86,Replicating speed is always a goal for racing games and ATV 2 meets the challenge. Fast is fast especially with the better ATV’s and the blurring effect during boost use really does bring that sense of speed home.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger,PlayStation 2,Sep-10-2002,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,PSM Magazine,80,The variety in its environments is quite high and the large number of mission objectives will certainly challenge you for countless hours. However the overall level of difficulty isnt that high. [Nov 2002 p.46]

Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. is a triumph. [Issue #14: Old vs. New – March/April 2015 p.68]
F1 2009,Wii,Nov-16-2009,Sumo Digital,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Formula One | Formula One | Automobile,Eurogamer,80,Once on-track few F1 games have managed to be as encouraging when it comes to pushing yourself to attack corners and better your lap time and fewer still have proved as much fun. This may not be the revolution the Formula 1 sub-genre has been waiting for but youre not likely to find many Wii owners complaining.
EVE Online,PC,May-6-2003,CCP,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Gaming Nexus,95,A robust tutorial. Classless character builds. Overwhelmingly open-ended gameplay. Ship designs you’ll need to wear a bib for. And a breed of PvP that’ll make adrenaline junkies sign up for rehab. Sci-fi worshipers: This is your Mecca.
The Punisher (2005),Xbox,Jan-17-2005,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Maxim Online,100,Its not all brutality. The Punisher is also one of the most immersive strategy games ever created. Aim for the head and enjoy.

Genesis Alpha One,Xbox One,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Xbox Tavern,90,Genesis Alpha One is a tremendous roguelike that rarely holds back. Its many systems are well balanced its plethora of unique objectives remain fresh and its random generation solidifies its already impressive variation. There’s room for minor improvements and there’s some slight visual blemishes across the entire board but this takes little away from the constant uncertainty that the game relays at a tense and frequent rate.
Flame Over,PlayStation Vita,Mar-10-2015,Laughing Jackal,Simulation | General | Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gamestyle,90,A fine entry into the Roguelike genre just don’t be fooled by its cutesy visuals this game is brutal.
City of Brass,PC,May-4-2018,Uppercut Games Pty Ltd,Action Adventure | General,Game Informer,78,Uppercut Games’ first roguelite is a strong entry in the crowded rogue-lite genre thanks to its amusing thievery-based brand of creativity. Though I’ve had my fill for now I imagine in a few weeks I’ll find myself running through the haunted halls and squares of some haunted desert setting gleefully filling my pockets with every shiny piece in sight.
World Gone Sour,Xbox 360,Apr-11-2012,Playbrains,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,ZTGD,87,All in all for five dollars you can easily have a fun time with World Gone Sour. Sure it is a glorified commercial for Sour Patch Kids but that doesnt stop it from being rather enjoyable. Its a competent little platformer that you and a friend on the couch can enjoy. The style is great and the narrator is legitimately funny at times. Give it a shot.
Blair Witch,PC,Aug-30-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,GameGrin,90,In all Bloober Team has done a great job of capturing the feel and ethos of the film series. With some unique and interesting mechanics a solid story and a cute pupper in a lead role it adds up to something really quite good. A few issues stop it from being perfect but it certainly does justice to a film that’s held dear to many.
The Secrets of Da Vinci: The Forbidden Manuscript,PC,Jun-7-2006,Kheops Studio,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,100,I had a wonderful time pretending to be a medieval snoop and I think that other gamers will too. While this is not a game Id replay over and over again it was a great deal of fun. More intellectual than emotional certainly but fun nonetheless.
Worms 4: Mayhem,Xbox,Oct-4-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,AceGamez,90,Another masterpiece from the Yorkshire Tea drinking developers another multiplayer hit from those flat-cap wearing geniuses.
Worms 3D,Xbox,Mar-1-2005,Team17,Strategy | General,Total Video Games,90,Utterly brilliant and everything that we could have hoped for.

Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix,GameCube,Oct-24-2005,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Cheat Code Central,90,A great value. If you like to visit the Mushroom Kingdom look silly playing a videogame and wish to get in shape rush out to your local game shop and pick up a copy.
Fortified,Xbox One,Feb-3-2016,Clapfoot Inc.,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gaming Age,91,All in all I’m pretty impressed with Fortified.

Song of the Deep,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Insomniac Games,Action Adventure | General,CGMagazine,95,Song of the Deep is also a great game. Its spunky protagonist had me rooting for her until the heartwarming conclusion and I didn’t want to leave the game’s enthralling world.

Hitman HD Enhanced Collection,PlayStation 4,Jan-11-2019,IO Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Cubed3,80,Both Hitman: Blood Money and Hitman: Absolution are a stealth gamers delight and a decent addition to the PS4s growing catalogue of classics. Veterans and newcomers alike will find something to enjoy in this diverse pairing but the over-the-top price tag is likely to discourage many who are on the fence. Nevertheless the remastering is good and both titles play well on the system even though there are no major graphical changes over the originals beyond a resolution bump and some minor interface tweaks.
Disco Dodgeball Remix,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Zen Studios,Sports | Team | Futuristic,GameSpace,85,A fun and competitive multiplayer game.

Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization,PlayStation 4,Nov-8-2016,Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | Action RPG,XGN,85,Sword Art Online Hollow Realization is an almost perfect imitation of an MMO. The game feels like one but is more JRPG than MMO. There is tons of stuff to do in a massive world. And it is lots of fun for fans but also for newcomers to the franchise.
Absolver,PlayStation 4,Aug-29-2017,Sloclap,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Worth Playing,90,In my opinion Absolver is in the upper echelon of recent releases but it still has a few issues. The camera can work against you at the most inopportune times like when youre cornered but thats more bearable to me than the motion blur. Other than those complaints the game slows down its offerings after a dozen hours or so unless youre playing co-op with friends. On the plus side theres supposed to be free DLC in the future and it seems like a pretty solid promise. Given Absolvers $30 price tag you cant really complain about this purchase.

Wings of War,PC,Aug-30-2004,Silver Wish Games,Simulation | Flight | WWI | WWI | Combat,Gamezilla!,90,Online play I might mention is excellent. Though currently sparsely populated Wings of War servers tend to draw dogfight specialists so your chances of getting more skilled when fighting online is very good.

IndyCar Series,PlayStation 2,May-21-2003,Codemasters,Driving | Racing | Formula One,IGN,85,The challenge level is great the dicing through traffic is adrenalin inducing (I had to force myself to release my death grip on the controller a few times) and the focus required to play is high. It just feels real.
The Sum of All Fears,Game Boy Advance,Nov-19-2002,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Nintendophiles,85,In my opinion ANY game that actually makes you want to see the movie and even read the books is a good one and that game did just that.
Outlaw Golf,GameCube,Oct-29-2002,Hypnotix,Sports | Traditional | Golf | Arcade,Game Over Online,80,With loose but logical controls humorous gameplay and more ways to stroke than… I’ll stop the punch line right there there are kids reading.
Spring Break,PC,Sep-10-2002,Deep Red,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Business / Tycoon,Yahoo!,80,With only the occasional shark attack and violent thunderstorm disrupting the tranquillity of island life the game doesnt have the same pace or urgency as say Theme Hospital or Theme Park but the task of setting-up and running grand holiday resorts is challenging enough to keep you engrossed for many an hour.
Crazy Taxi,GameCube,Nov-17-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameZone,90,One of the best video games ever made.
Trade Empires,PC,Sep-17-2001,Frog City Software,Strategy | General | General,IGN,83,A fine entertaining game. You will find yourself playing the missions for many hours and repeating them to use different strategies.
Sudden Strike,PC,Jan-23-2001,Fireglow,Strategy | General | General,TotalGames.net,93,If you love real-time strategy but are getting a little bored of tank rushes and linear opposition then you should snap this up as soon as you can – it’s worth every penny and then some.

The Inner Friend,Xbox One,Apr-28-2020,Playmind,Action Adventure | General,Xbox Tavern,80,The Inner Friend is creepy abstract touching and something that will get under your skin. There’s a story here that is relatable yet presented in a way that captures the exaggerated-ness of a child’s imagination. Movement is a little fiddly and it’s all over quickly but the experience is still one that will stick with us for some time yet.
Mercenary Kings: Reloaded Edition,Switch,Feb-6-2018,Tribute Games,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,CGMagazine,90,It may just be nostalgia but for its price Mercenary Kings Reloaded feels like a perfectly fair package.
We Were Here Too,PC,Feb-2-2018,Total Mayhem Games,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Gamer.nl,75,We Were Here Too is a cool co-op puzzle game that challenges you to escape from a room by communicating well. Many puzzles feel the same so the replay value of this game is not very high.
Warhammer 40000: Sanctus Reach,PC,Jan-19-2017,Strayllight Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Meristation,80,Sanctus Reach is a classic turn-based strategy game full of good ideas and with a high number of campaigns that guarantee many hours of entertainment.

Nightmares from the Deep 2: The Siren's Call,Xbox One,Aug-26-2016,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object | General,TrueAchievements,80,The hidden object and puzzle gameplay is solid and is only let-down by the clunky mahjong controls. However the story is an enjoyable romp across a cursed island. If its one thing that Artifex Mundi fans have learned its that you never go anywhere on a dark and stormy night when there is no shortage of supernatural threats.
Deadlight: Director's Cut,Xbox One,Jun-21-2016,Tequila Works,Action | Platformer | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine UK,80,An excellent action puzzle platformer but unnecessary if you have it on Xbox 360. [Sept 2016 p.76]

Broken Sword 5: The Serpents' Curse - Part I,PC,Dec-4-2013,Revolution Software,General | Adventure | General,DarkStation,90,In its current form The Serpent’s Curse is half finished.

Section 8,Xbox 360,Sep-1-2009,TimeGate Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Age,83,All the little things that game incorporates into combat like the drop ship spawning the customizable load outs the base control with automated defenses and the various modules keep Section 8 from being a bland multiplayer shooter and help it stand out against the pack of Halos and Call of Dutys that currently populate the system.
NBA Ballers: Rebound,PSP,May-9-2006,Backbone Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade | Arcade,eToychest,82,A good arcade-style basketball game to pass the time. Just keep in mind that the loading is atrocious.
Black & White 2 - Battle of the Gods,PC,Apr-24-2006,Lionhead Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,AceGamez,90,The addition of more creatures gives it more depth and will keep you amused that little bit longer plus the plot is amusing and explores the darker side of Eden what with the undead running around all over the place and everything.
Fusion: Genesis,Xbox 360,Nov-9-2011,Starfire Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gamestyle,90,For 800 MS Points there are few better Xbox Arcade releases out there; make it your own mission to the stars.
SimCity DS,DS,Jun-19-2007,Aki Corp.,Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,Games Master UK,85,A great game strongly converted to its ideal system - but its not as flexible as it could be. [Aug 2007 p.68]
Mayan Death Robots,PC,Nov-20-2015,Sileni Studios,Strategy | General,CGMagazine,90,The real marvel of Mayan Death Robots is that it’s the first game of its type that I don’t feel is an incomplete experience if you don’t have friends to play it with.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands,PC,Mar-6-2017,Ubisoft Paris,Action Adventure | Open-World,Ragequit.gr,92,Ghost Recon Wildlands does not really innovate. However it offers enjoyable tactical stealth gameplay set in an impressive vast world and provides a fun memorable and rewarding experience in both co-op and solo playthroughs. Main missions are well-designed and offer great variety and challenge and although the story is rather predictable it has great presentation and ample amounts of information to support it. It is in its core a true Tom Clancy title and worthy successor to the Ghost Recon series.
Murasaki Baby,PlayStation Vita,Sep-16-2014,Ovosonico,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Action | Platformer | 2D,PSNStores,90,This might not be something that I go back to often but it’s left me satisfied in a way that not many games do.
Vampyr,Switch,Oct-29-2019,DONTNOD Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Hobby Consolas,83,This port of Vampyr is the perfect way to investigate yours sins wherever you are. Great job for a great videogame.
Magicka 2,PC,May-26-2015,Pieces Interactive,Fantasy | Action Adventure | General,Cheat Code Central,86,Magicka 2 doesnt mess much with the formula of the first title. If the hours you spent traipsing through Midgård before grew tedious the sequel may not wield enough magic to hold your attention. However if you dropped the first game quickly due to the plethora of game breaking launch bugs or missed this gem of series altogether it is more than worth your time for an excellently priced $15.
Magician's Quest: Mysterious Times,DS,May-11-2009,Konami | Aquria,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,VideoGamer,80,Despite the fact that it is clearly being marketed at children Enchanted Folk is a surprisingly deep game. Fans of Animal Crossing may feel that this is a little too similar for its own good but other young gamers should have plenty of fun with their magical studies. The slow pace wont be for everyone but kids who do like this will probably play it for a long time.
Enchanted Arms,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,From Software,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | General | Japanese-Style,Gaming Age,91,With the Japanese dialog the stunning visuals and the solid turn-based combat system its the first game in a long time that sates my appetite for the old school RPG.
The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince,PlayStation 4,Feb-12-2019,Nippon Ichi Software,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,This developer/ publisher understands the Grimm aesthetic and structure better than anyone else out there.
The Sun and Moon,Xbox One,Jan-27-2017,Digerati Distribution,Action | Platformer | 2D,TheXboxHub,90,I love this game. I may not have completed it chances are I’m going to struggle with a few of the stages for days weeks and months on end and I’ve more or less given up even trying to pick up half moon full moon and full sun rewards but the overall sense of achievement that The Sun and Moon gives in just the bog standard completion of a stage is enough of a reason for me to keep playing.
Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s,PlayStation 2,Jul-24-2007,Harmonix Music Systems,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,GotNext,90,Its a lot of (very familiar) fun but like an overpriced concert t-shirt theres no escaping the feeling that its not quite the value it looked when enthusiasm had free reign over your wallet.
Super Dragon Ball Heroes: World Mission,Switch,Apr-5-2019,Dimps Corporation | Safari Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Card Battle,Vandal,85,Great gameplay lots of depth tons of content and even more fan service. If you love Dragon Ball and you’re happy to try something different don’t miss it.
Rebel Cops,PC,Sep-17-2019,Weappy Studio,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,GameGrin,80,All in all Rebel Cops is a blast to play and feels like a great modification to the This Is The Police formula. Everything feels right the management is fun and challenging the story is interesting enough and there are no bugs or glitches that I have run into thus far.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Game Boy Advance,May-25-2004,Griptonite Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Nintendo Power,88,Though the inventory and menu systems need polishing this RPG is a dream come true for Harry Potter fans. [July 2004 p.119]
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,PC,Nov-18-2003,Acclaim | Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear | 2D,IGN,80,What it will do however is help pass the time away for nine to twelve hours with its mindless but ultimately fun approach to the genre.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger,GameCube,Sep-10-2002,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendojo,81,With a total of nine levels and three boss battles the total runtime of Ty is about ten hours flat.
Motocross Maniacs Advance,Game Boy Advance,Mar-21-2002,Konami,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Play Magazine,100,Anyone who reveled in the joy of the NES Excitebike and the original Motocross Maniacs will undoubtedly love this update. [April 2002 p.71]
4x4 EVO 2,PC,Oct-30-2001,Terminal Reality,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,GameZone,98,This game comes as close to the real 4 wheeling mud slinging rock climbing log jumping experience as you can get without actually climbing into a real 4X4.
Prehistorik Man,Game Boy Advance,Oct-16-2001,Titus Software,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Maxx,82,A solid platformer but also at the same time is somewhat generic.
NASCAR Thunder 2002,PlayStation,Oct-2-2001,Black Box,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,GameZone,90,The sounds and graphics are as good as allowed on the PSX platform.
Destruction Derby Raw,PlayStation,Sep-26-2000,Studio 33,Driving | Demolition Derby,Spank!,80,But if you want a game thats best in short sharp bursts good fun and mildly relaxing to boot you could do a lot worse.
D2,Dreamcast,Aug-22-2000,WARP,Action Adventure | Horror,Sega X,90,Can you handle the horror? I think not but I sure would like to see you try thats if you can stand the action the exploration and the intense plot.
Earth Defense Force 2017,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2007,Sandlot,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Age,91,Whether or not you dig the Ed Wood production values its hard to deny the massive amounts of action adventure and mind-boggling fun that can be had in the fulfilling campaign.
.hack//G.U. vol. 1//Rebirth,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,CyberConnect2,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Play Magazine,90,Its time to dive back in if youre already a citizen and if youre not gain access to the gaming worlds most compelling simulated cyber space. [Nov. 2006 p.76]
West of Dead,PC,Jun-18-2020,Upstream Arcade,Action Adventure | General,PC Gamer,83,A fine balancing act of challenge and intrigue with stabiliser wheels courtesy of Ron Perlmans voice.
Under Siege,PlayStation 3,Jun-2-2011,Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Impulsegamer,85,Overall the game is definitely worth the price and will provide some good entertainment. Hardcore RTS fans wont find the game to be very good unless they look at it as a new type of game as opposed to an RTS and casual gamers will find they can play and enjoy the game even without being fans of RTSs. As such the game fits a nice niche along with an amazing price. If a person can look past a few flaws then they should find an enjoyable game for a low price.
Star Wars: Battlefront II,PSP,Oct-31-2005,Pandemic Studios | Savage Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Game Chronicles,81,Not only is it the best handheld adaptation of a major console title it adds extensive PSP-exclusive features making this a must-own game even if you already have the game for another system.
Sword of the Stars: The Pit,PC,Feb-22-2013,Kerberos Productions,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG | Roguelike,RPG Fan,81,Whether played with DLC or not The Pit is one of the more solid roguelike titles on Steam especially in a relatively flooded market. It is challenging but generally fair and allows the player a lot of choices in character development while providing a good atmosphere for dungeon delving. While its graphics and sound may not impress The Pits gameplay will keep players unafraid of long streaks of failure and ensure they come back to challenge it just one more time.
One Piece: Grand Battle,PlayStation 2,Sep-7-2005,Ganbarion,Action | Fighting | 3D,AceGamez,100,A title perfect for gamers of any age. Its safe for kids as theres only animated violence and it sports a simplified control scheme yet it has enough content and challenge to keep experienced adult gamers entertained for quite some time.
Driver: Parallel Lines,Xbox,Mar-14-2006,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Mission-based,Official Xbox Magazine UK,86,A genuine and triumphant return to form for the Driver series and even shows the mighty Grand Theft Auto franchise a few cool new tricks along the way. [April 2006 p.65]
Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,Koei Tecmo Games,Strategy | General,GamesVillage.it,85,A lot of fun (and a lot of blood) is waiting for you especially if this is your first approach to the series.
Need for Speed: The Run,PC,Nov-15-2011,Black Box,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Bit-Gamer,90,While points have to be docked for the annoying QTEs the rest of The Run is amazingly exhilarating. The set pieces left us panting for breath unable to process what had just happened and the excitement level only dropped to really exciting in between.
Guns Gore & Cannoli,Xbox One,Sep-25-2015,Claeys Brothers Arts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,MondoXbox,82,An original and stylish 2D run-and-gun shooter with great graphics and artistic design and lots of crazy weapons. Highly fun both alone or in co-op definitely recommended.
Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1,PlayStation Vita,Aug-26-2014,Felistella,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,90,RE;Birth 1 is a damned fine JRPG. Its silly its charming and its irreverent but its also a package thats been wrapped up in a clever rich combat system. This was the start that the Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise deserved.
Trouble Witches Neo!,Xbox 360,Apr-27-2011,Adventure Planning Service,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Vandal,85,A great HD adaptation of the classic game which fans of old-school arcades will love.
Tower of Guns,PlayStation 4,Apr-10-2015,Terrible Posture Games,Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,SpazioGames,80,Tower of Guns is an old style FPS based on speed jumps reflexes and difficulty. With only one life available and the impressive quantity of enemies and bullets the frustration is often around the corner but thanks to the numerous upgrades and power-ups the game never becomes impossible (just a bit confusing).
NCAA March Madness 08,Xbox 360,Dec-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,TeamXbox,79,In NCAA 08 March Madness’s case an intricate post-play mechanism online leagues and the best classic collegiate hoop teams of all time make it twisty enough for us to recommend it as a worthy upgrade to last year’s offering.
Twin Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Adventure,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2020,Lillymo,Action | Arcade,Player 2,75,With Twin Breaker the team at Lillymo along with Moriarty and Maldenado have constructed a wonderful take on a time-honoured genre that has been woefully underserved in recent years.
Where the Water Tastes Like Wine,Switch,Nov-29-2019,Serenity Forge | Dim Bulb Games,Miscellaneous | Adventure | General,Nintendo Enthusiast,95,Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is an upcoming game about traveling sharing stories and surviving manifest destiny. Featuring gorgeous illustration by Kellan Jett Where the Water Tastes Like Wine combines 2D visuals with a 3D overworld US map. Players wander through the United States - and through a century of history - to meet a variety of people each with their own stories to tell.
The Long Reach,Xbox One,Jul-18-2018,Painted Black Games,Action Adventure | Survival,GameGrin,80,A deeply layered story with the scares to match The Long Reach brings back the basics of psychological-horror by keeping players both intrigued and nervous until the very end.
The Golf Club 2,Xbox One,Jun-27-2017,HB Studios Multimedia | Maximum Games,Sports | Individual | Golf | Arcade,XboxAddict,80,Despite some of the drawbacks The Golf Club 2 is right now the elite golf experience on the Xbox platform. With EA having a tough time with their golf game HB Studios simply crushed it with The Golf Club 2. Its going to seem frustrating aggravating (especially putting) and at times it will test the durability of an Xbox Elite controller but all of that stress anguish and turmoil melts away instantly when you unlock the achievement of getting a hole-in-one from over 250+ yards (I literally jumped up yelling and cheering when I hit it). Then its back to normal and I ended up getting a bogey on the next hole. One thing is for certain and thats The Golf Game 2 will take you on a ride of emotions. Is it worth $39.99 plus tax? Without a doubt it is.
SimCity Creator,DS,Sep-22-2008,Electronic Arts,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Management | Breeding/Constructing | Government,Pocket Gamer UK,90,Sim City goes all Bill and Teds Awesome Reconstruction Adventure. Quite simply the only regional administration simulation you need to own.
Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure,3DS,Jun-11-2015,Nintendo,Puzzle | Stacking,NF Magazine,85,Even though it misses a few chances to do more Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure is still the best version of this classic puzzler so far. [Issue #16 – July/August 2015 p.21]
AER: Memories of Old,PC,Oct-25-2017,Daedalic Entertainment | Forgotten Key,Action Adventure | General | Open-World,GameGrin,80,Featuring a stunning low-poly art style a wonderfully well-integrated soundtrack an ingeniously simple control scheme an interesting transformation mechanic and impressively designed temples AER has a lot going for it. It’s unfortunate that the experience is as short as it is and there is no way to keep track of what’s been seen. A few more environmental puzzles and a simple journal would fix my only complaints about this exploration-heavy title.
Graveyard Keeper,PC,Aug-15-2018,Lazy Bear Games,Simulation | Action Adventure | Virtual | Open-World | Career,Jeuxvideo.com,75,Beside its evident qualities in terms of immersion due to a funny unique and charming context Graveyard Keeperand lacks variety and is sometimes too much based on farming system.
Wet,Xbox 360,Sep-15-2009,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Armchair Empire,88,There never seemed to be alternate routes to take; theres one way to go and thats it.
The Blackout Club,Xbox One,Jul-30-2019,Question,Action Adventure | Survival,Xbox Tavern,77,So to some up The Blackout Club is a Fun addictive 4 player co-op horror with a Stranger Things atmosphere and lots of paranormal paranoia. Fans of the genre will dive for this and its nice to see a brave new attempt at the horror game. With the new enhanced horror system being a plus I can see people are going to be very curious about this title.
Cycle 28,Switch,Aug-2-2018,Pill Bug Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Switch Player,80,Despite the fairly limited upgrades and occasional flaws there’s plenty of enjoyment to be found in Cycle 28. Its fast-paced addictive gameplay will keep you coming back again and again and again… Needless to say the name is apt.
DOOM VFR,PC,Nov-30-2017,id Software,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Arcade,VRFocus,100,Ultimately DOOM VFR stands as a fine example of just what can be achieved with the FPS genre in VR as of today lining-up against Robo Recall as an action-heavy experience that throws the rulebook out of the window. It’s true that the visual quality has suffered dramatically and the control systems could be seen as far too awkward by many but the fact that DOOM VFR pushes so hard against the VR grain makes it well worth any PlayStation VR owner’s time and money.
The Simpsons Arcade Game,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2012,None,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Eurogamer Germany,80,If such an arcade-cabinet had existed near my home 20 years ago my parents would still be paying off the debts I would have accumulated by feeding it quarters. Even if you take into account the shortcomings The Simpsons Arcade is along Turtles in Time as one of the best Beat em ups out there.
Harvest Moon: Magical Melody,Wii,Aug-25-2009,Marvelous Entertainment,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Management | Breeding/Constructing | Business / Tycoon,IGN UK,80,Its soothing compulsive and peculiarly thrilling all at once: a perfect little world where working hard brings its own tangible rewards and cows have huge happy faces. Even in this slightly butchered state its good to see Magical Melody finally on these shores.
RiftStar Raiders,PlayStation 4,Feb-27-2018,Climax Studios,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,PSX-Sense.nl,85,A challenging and deep experience RiftStar Raiders will keep you enthralled for most of its runtime.
BADLAND: Game of the Year Edition,Xbox One,May-29-2015,Frogmind,Action | Action Adventure | Arcade | Linear,Brash Games,100,Quite simply a breath-taking game.
The Conduit,Wii,Jun-23-2009,High Voltage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,91,The Conduit is a flawed masterpiece: it doesn’t quite live up to the nigh-unreachable hype built up around it but by breaking so much ground on the Wii it does something more important than meet the hype.
Erica,PlayStation 4,Aug-19-2019,Flavourworks,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Gaming Nexus,85,Erica tells a boilerplate story—but tells it very well. With a fresh intuitive interface and some of the best production values and acting ever seen in a video game Erica feels very much like what it aspires to be—an interactive film. Erica is perhaps an odd experiment but one well worth experiencing for gamers that enjoy trips off the beaten path.
NHL 2K9,Xbox 360,Sep-8-2008,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,Planet Xbox 360,82,The best online addition this year is the Team-Up feature something all sports games should have going forward.
DESYNC,PC,Feb-28-2017,Foregone,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GamingTrend,85,An immensely tough but amazingly satisfying shooter experience for only $15 (USD). If you’re looking for a serious challenge a brightly colored uniquely appealing geometric aesthetic or the best ‘80s soundtrack you never knew you needed in your life then Desync is your jam.
HoopWorld,Wii,Jul-19-2010,Virtual Toys,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade | Arcade,IGN,80,Its a truly impressive alternative to the Jam experience that even excels beyond my nostalgia memories of that arcade classic in some respects.
Assassin's Creed II: Discovery,DS,Nov-17-2009,Griptonite Games,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Vandal,85,Assasins Creed 2: Discovery is an excellent action and platforming game which offers more than ten hours of adventure through the charming Ezio.
Rag Doll Kung Fu,PC,Oct-12-2005,Mark Healey,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,PC Gamer,76,Even though this game is an indie effort the art and sound production are professional-quality. [Jan 2006 p.57]
Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup,PC,Oct-28-2003,Electronic Arts,Sports | Alternative | Team | Individual | Other | Other,GameZone,81,Just realize you absolutely must use a gamepad and you will have a lot of fun.
The Haunted Mansion,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,High Voltage Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,Just Adventure,83,While The Haunted Mansion can not be classified as a children’s game it does have a genial yet spooky feel about it and is easily accessible by both novice and veteran gamers.
Iron Storm,PC,Oct-25-2002,4X Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Gamezilla!,94,The story is what really what makes Iron Storm rock!
Castlevania Chronicles,PlayStation,Oct-8-2001,Konami,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cinescape,83,Its only too bad that a few extras couldnt be included. I would have loved to have a couple of the NES sequels on the disc. Also all the technical aspects (graphics sound) are dated (as they should be).
Xtreme Sports,Dreamcast,Nov-27-2000,Innerloop,Sports | Alternative | Other,Hot Games,80,If not for the xtreme difficulty of the game this would be one of the best titles of the year. Its still a landmark in terms of graphics.
Sports Champions 2,PlayStation 3,Oct-30-2012,SCEA | Zindagi Games,Sports | General | General,Gaming Age,83,To wrap it up if you enjoyed the first Sports Champions game or motion controlled sports games in general Sports Champions 2 is definitely worth a look. Even with only 6 events the challenging Arcade Mode and very customizable Party Mode along with the wealth of options and unlockables available will keep players busy and moving for many hours.
Mirror's Edge Catalyst,PlayStation 4,Jun-7-2016,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Modern | Action Adventure | General,Hobby Consolas,92,Faith runs with freedom in a game that feels as fresh as the original and gives a step forward in every aspect. If parkour is a religion DICE is its particular Holy See.
Genesis Alpha One,PlayStation 4,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Everyeye.it,60,Not always fascinating.
Dr. Luigi,Wii U,Dec-31-2013,Arika | Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,Gamereactor Sweden,60,Germ fighting with Luigi offers good fun but Dr Luigi is way over prized and you can easily get more and better similar puzzle games for less than a dollar/euro. This is just not worth the cost for Wii U it doesnt have enough content.
Armored Core 4,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2007,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Game Informer,65,Multiplayer is what’s really going to get the fans riled. After fine-tuning your ideal mech in single player you can bring it online and face off against anywhere from one to seven opponents. Unfortunately there’s not a whole lot of match variety outside of deathmatch and team deathmatch and there’s no respawning so matches don’t last much longer than five minutes tops.
Kill la Kill: IF,Switch,Jul-26-2019,Studio TRIGGER | Aplus,Action Adventure | General | Action | Fighting | 3D,PLAY! Zine,60,For the fans of the Kill la Kill anime this would be a great and fun game to have and play with friends. Its button mashy system and crazy action are well presented. But lack of playable characters and high price tag drag it down for now.
NASCAR 09,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2008,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Stock Car | Stock Car | Automobile,Game Chronicles,63,Yes there are a lot of features that really make this game fun and interesting but there are a lot of other racing games that will hold your interest longer and are more entertaining.
Mazes of Fate,Game Boy Advance,Dec-6-2006,Sabarasa Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,IGN,65,Its a game built for the fans that grew up playing classic games on early computers. For many gamers it may be a title their father will find more interesting than they do.
198X,Switch,Jan-23-2020,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,Vooks,60,Ultimately I did enjoy my time with 198X. Much like my own youthful trips to the arcade it dazzled me briefly but cuts itself short before delivering a substantial experience. What it does succeed at though is decorating itself in a pastiche of ‘80s arcade hits with a brilliant aesthetic and authentic retro remakes. The $15 price isn’t outrageous but the short runtime might be enough to convince you to wait for a sale before pumping those hard-earned coins.
SingStar Celebration,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,Critical Hit,70,If this is a celebration then its a muted one. Im not sure Singstar will ever relive its glory days but Celebration is a decent karaoke game that doesnt need extra accessories and peripherals. Its fun and infinitely better than singing along to your favourite song on the radio pretending your hairbrush or potato peeler is a microphone.
Pro Cycling Manager Season 2013: Le Tour de France - 100th Edition,PC,Jun-20-2013,Cyanide,Alternative | Biking | Sports | Individual | Biking,Gamereactor Denmark,60,If you are crazy about the tour then Le Tour de France 2013 - 100th Edition is a decent take on the cycling sport. Unfortunately the mechanics of the game aren’t very well explained and even if it is fun at times managing your resources it never fulfills its potential.
Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor - Martyr,PlayStation 4,Aug-23-2018,Maximum Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General,PSX-Sense.nl,65,If youre looking for longevity then look no further. The lore is interesting enough to continue playing. The audiovisual design is well done and even though the game is pretty difficult newcomers wont be scared off by it. Technically there are plenty of issues. Frame rate hiccups long load times a copious amount of screen tearing and lacklustre matchmaking are our major gripes.
The Baconing,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Eurogamer Sweden,60,Deathspank: The Baconing is a fun game with first class humour that gets dragged down by repetitive combat. Brilliant in small doses though.
Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo,Wii,Oct-20-2009,Media Vision,Action | Adventure | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Nintendo Power,65,Its a shame that Revenge of King Piccolo becomes essentially a mediocre fighting game in the latter part of the adventure. [Dec 2009 p.88]
Heavy Weapon: Atomic Tank,PlayStation 3,Jun-11-2009,PopCap,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Video Game Talk,60,If Heavy Weapon feels like an online Flash Game at any time you’ll be happy to know that it basically is. There’s fun to be had here for sure but it’s not the same type of fun that you get from a long epic story.
Skelattack,PlayStation 4,Jun-2-2020,Ukuza,Action | Platformer | 2D,Comicbook.com,60,Skelattack is a great-looking albeit completely frustrating game that will surely delight and infuriate folks. Even though I tossed my controller aside more than once in my playthrough I can’t help but feel the allure to try again. I know I’m going to grunt and moan the entire time but the look and lore of this game are too much to ignore despite my complaints.
Fragments of Him,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Sassybot,Adventure | Visual Novel,DarkStation,60,If you can forgive the technical faux pas the somewhat creepy mannequin people the absence of any memorable music and the bare bones gameplay theres a fantastic story buried underneath the rubble. All of the characters are three dimensional and real the voice acting feels authentic and the writing is smart but never preachy. At its core Fragments of Him is just a poignant story of love and loss. It showcases Will and his partners relationship as normal and pedestrian. Its almost mundane. But this approach is all the more effective when something that should just be normal and average is treated as such. Based on the title of the game you can kind of assume where the narrative is likely heading to but the journey there while bumpy is one worth taking.
Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2014,Aqua Plus,Real-Time | Fantasy | Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | Visual Novel | General,Everyeye.it,65,Western tastes wont have an easy time connecting to this typically eastern product. In the end its more a visual novel than a truly interactive game and that calls for very specific tastes.
Band Hero,DS,Nov-3-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,AtomicGamer,62,Overall Band Hero on the DS is a step in the wrong direction for portable music games. Theyve tried to go big on the peripheral front but in doing so theyve excluded a huge chunk of gamers in a wide range of ages.
Aven Colony,PC,Jul-25-2017,Mothership Entertainment,Strategy | Management | Government,Game World Navigator Magazine,65,Boring sandbox mode is partly compensated by the campaign: in each mission developers came up with new ways to complicate the life of the colonists while at the same time unraveling a story about the imminent end of the world and the search for alien artifacts. [Issue#223 p.60]
Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe,3DS,Aug-29-2014,HAL Labs,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,FNintendo,60,Dededes Drum Dash Deluxe may not be plentiful as far as its contents are concerned but what is to be found here is entertaining enough to keep any kind of player happy throughout some quick gaming sessions.
Antigraviator,PC,Jun-6-2018,Iceberg Interactive,Racing | Arcade | Futuristic,DualShockers,65,Antigraviator is a no-holds-bar dedication to arcadey futuristic speed. But packing in more content would elevate the experience to something better.
Obscure,PlayStation 2,Apr-6-2005,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror,IncGamers,60,If you are sceptical of games that feature co-operative multi-character play you neednt worry too much; its handled reasonably well.
How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition,PlayStation 4,Nov-4-2014,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Survival,LaPS4,63,The great amount of walking dead related products in recent years seems endless. How to Survive takes its place among the zombie comics movies and TV shows mixing enough genres to work quite well even though it might be quite expensive for what it really is a PlayStation 3 game.
Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes,Wii,Oct-12-2010,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,3DJuegos,67,Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes gets the Dynasty Warriors formula and changes the face. It is extremely funny and it will attract the lovers of this genre but this game is really poor in IA lack in innovation and really repetitive and linear.
Bee Movie Game,PlayStation 2,Oct-30-2007,Beenox,Action | General,TotalPlayStation,65,Far far better than the odds would suggest and though its not all perfect whats there is certainly worth picking up if you enjoyed the movie and want something to play with the kids.
Crash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2007,Radical Entertainment,Action | General | General,GameZone,64,Save for the cooperative mode there’s not much here worthy of a gamer’s time that is devoted to buying and renting the best games.
NHL 08,PC,Sep-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,NZGamer,61,A pretty average affair. Fun can be had if you’re really into your hockey but there are better games to choose from.
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Gaming Age,58,If the gameplay was a little more involved with less button bashing and greater emphasis on using combos for effectiveness it would provide a more fufilling experience.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PC,Nov-15-2001,KnowWonder,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpy,68,The game runs poorly on just about any machine.
Stretch Panic,PlayStation 2,Aug-28-2001,Treasure,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Gaming Age,58,Here is proof that originality alone is not a basis for a fun game.
Off-Road Redneck Racing,PC,May-2-2001,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Computer Games Magazine,60,Provided you keep the sound on mute pump up the resolution and have a few hours to spare this is decent down-home motor madness served the finger lickin way.
Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition,Dreamcast,Oct-28-2000,Climax Entertainment,Driving | Mission-based,Dreamcast.net,62,This title has so many graphical bugs and glitches that I wonder how it even managed to make it here from Japan in the first place.
Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour,Dreamcast,Jul-19-2000,Crystal Dynamics,Driving | Racing | Kart,IGN,63,Ripped directly from the soundtracks in Disney Studios the score is clear authentic and most definitely happening.
Afro Samurai,PlayStation 3,Jan-27-2009,Namco Bandai Games America | Namco Bandai Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Play UK,61,It’s a great-looking game thick with atmosphere and brilliant music. Sadly someone forgot to show as much care to the gameplay so only fans of the comics and TV series are likely to finish the adventure with much satisfaction.
Brothers in Arms: D-Day,PSP,Dec-5-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,60,A solid attempt to bring the gritty realism of war to handheld but shooter-nuts are better off sticking with Medal of Honor Heroes. [Jan 2007 p.88]
Lovely Planet,Xbox One,Jan-8-2016,QUICKTEQUILA,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine UK,60,A tough cookie. As a twitch game it suffers from poor feedback and imprecision but its snappy pace keeps you hooked. [March 2016 p.86]
Mini Ninjas Adventures,Xbox 360,Jun-29-2012,Side Kick LTD,Action | General | General,Multiplayer.it,65,Pretty tower defense like game with Kinect sensor. Hiro is back and your arm is now the katana. Just beware the considerable physical effort!
Powerstar Golf,Xbox One,Nov-22-2013,Zoe Mode,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade,COGconnected,69,Powerstar Golf has a strange addictiveness to it.
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,Xbox 360,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,games(TM),60,The one area it does get right is the driving. [Issue#115 p.99]

Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli,Wii,Aug-26-2008,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Other | Other | GT / Street | Automobile,Eurogamer,50,If you can get used to the nunchuk and remote as a surrogate wheel then the experience is passable but nothing more.
Just Cause 4,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gamer.no,60,Just Cause 4 is a big dumb and lovely action game that offers hours of great entertainment for those willing to look past its blemishes and technical faults.
Tekken Hybrid,PlayStation 3,Nov-22-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Gamereactor Denmark,60,A mediocre movie a re-release of and old classic and a demo of an upcoming game. Thats what Tekken Hybrid contains and whether you should get it depends entirely on how much you miss playing Tekken Tag Tournament. If you dont theres little reason to pick this up unless you really really love everything related to the Tekken games and universe.
Brave: The Video Game,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,Disney Interactive Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Linear,COGconnected,65,Brave possesses a unique charm and should be considered if you are on the lookout for a well made kid-friendly title to add to your collection.
Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code,PSP,Mar-28-2006,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,G4 TV,60,The biggest sticking point is that Untold Legends has been told before several different times in several different guises. While improved from its predecessor Warrior’s Code is not quite up to the level of a Diablo Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance or similar hack-and-slash titles.
Skully,Switch,Aug-4-2020,Finish Line Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cultured Vultures,60,While the voice acting storytelling and platforming in Skully is top class the visual issues might cause you to lose your head.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2,PlayStation Vita,Aug-18-2015,Frima Studio,Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,PlayStation Universe,65,Resident Evil: Revelations 2 on PS Vita is a flawed port that only comes recommended if it’s your sole option of playing the game.
Farming Simulator 2013,PC,Oct-25-2012,Giants Software,Miscellaneous | General | Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,You can find a lot of educational value in this simulation but as entertainment it just doesn’t work – its more edutainment than a game. [Jan 2013]
Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Battle March,PC,Sep-2-2008,Black Hole Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN AU,63,Ultimately Battle March has added a new single player campaign a little meat to the multiplayer and two new factions to take control of.
Crayola Treasure Adventures,DS,Oct-1-2007,Crave,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,60,Only inflict on youngsters when youre absolutely desperate. [May 2008 p.75]
Delta Force: Xtreme,PC,Apr-22-2005,NovaLogic,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,G4 TV,60,A budget title and it plays like one. Every feature this game has to offer has been better implemented elsewhere.
Battleship,Xbox One,Aug-2-2016,Frima Studio,Miscellaneous | Board / Card Game,Areajugones,65,Battleship is a game with fancy graphics and some innovative ideas but it doesn’t stand out in any aspect. A game for fans only.
Depth,PC,Nov-3-2014,Digital Confectioners,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,58,Depth is a Left 4 Dead clone sunk by its sea of flaws.
Titan Quest,Switch,Jul-31-2018,THQ Nordic,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GamePro Germany,61,Quotation forthcoming.
James Bond 007: Blood Stone,PlayStation 3,Nov-2-2010,Bizarre Creations,Action | Driving | Shooter | Mission-based | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamer.nl,60,Blood Stone feels like a Bond-movie directed by Michael Bay. The game opens impressively with variety in surroundings and the perfect Bond-vibe. But after an hour the lack of deep gameplay becomes grating and the shooting parts dont offer anything you havent seen anywhere else before. Furthermore the racelevels are downright disappointing and the only gadget in your possession is useless.
ZEN Pinball 2: Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron,PlayStation 4,Apr-22-2015,Zen Studios,Action | Pinball,GameCritics,50,Fans of the blockbuster might enjoy the set dressing applied to this pinball table but those looking for a solid pinball board underneath the veneer might be left wanting.
Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave Incident,Wii,Jun-29-2011,Sanzaru Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Hidden Object | Puzzle | General,Nintendo Gamer,64,Not too taxing but well made. [Aug 2011 p.73]
Zombie Panic in Wonderland,Wii,May-3-2010,Akaoni Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Eurogamer,60,Zombie Panics gleeful initial charm and quirky visual appeal wane once the frenzied bullet-spraying repetition kicks in after a couple of stages. Its evidently one of those games best sampled in small doses.
Daemonica,PC,Mar-31-2006,Cinemax | RA Images,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Gamer 2.0,70,We like Daemonica for its refreshing variations on tired themes and a sincere attempt to introduce a nifty potion-mixing element into its chilling story.
Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta,Xbox 360,Aug-3-2009,Bethesda Softworks,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,VideoGamer,60,Mothership Zeta is a let down. Its nowhere near as good as Point Lookout or The Pitt. Its slightly better than Operation Anchorage but only slightly. Its a linear repetitive slog through an alien space ship and nothing else. Is it a fitting finale? No. Is it worth 800MS Points? Just. If only for the Samurai Armour. Sniff.
Urban Trial Tricky,Switch,Jun-25-2020,Tate Multimedia,Sports | Individual | Biking,Starbit,60,Urban Trial Tricky is simple...simple and fun and its good at what it does. While the game doesnt harbour AAA ambitions this is without a doubt a very fun way to pass some time and to enjoy the kicks and adrenaline rushes given by performing stunts on a bike. The experience would be better if the levels felt a little less claustrophobic but as a quick fun experience Urban Trial Tricky is a welcome addition to the Nintendo Switch catalogue.
Dead or School,Switch,Mar-13-2020,Studio Nanafushi,Action Adventure | General,God is a Geek,65,If you enjoy gameplay focused experiences and can tolerate some jank Dead or School will be worth getting when it drops in price.
Conarium,PlayStation 4,Feb-12-2019,Zoetrope Interactive,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,TheSixthAxis,60,Conarium is a good example of a Lovecraftian game. It focuses on the atmosphere and lore that characterises the genre whilst mostly avoiding the worst excesses. It tells an intriguing story well despite the slightly dodgy voice acting and presents a good approximation of the impossible non-Euclidean geometry of the Elder God’s world. If you like a touch of Cthulhu in your life then you could do worse than venturing into Conarium’s brand of madness.
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,PC,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Total Video Games,60,Fun to play in the short term especially over the course of a mission or two theres a repetitiveness to the gameplay that fails to entice players to experience the campaign for hours on end.
Serious Sam: Next Encounter,PlayStation 2,Apr-22-2004,Climax Group,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Play.tm,60,It is cheap and cheerful but it ultimately fails to do itself justice on the PS2.
Naval Ops: Commander,PlayStation 2,Mar-9-2004,Micro Cabin,Simulation | Ship,GamerFeed,60,Had the graphics been retouched a bit the pace been picked up the sound been reworked and multiplayer been considered this couldve been the luxury yacht of war games.
Conflict: Desert Storm II - Back to Baghdad,PC,Oct-7-2003,Pivotal Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameSpot,63,At least the PC version is easier to play thanks to the wider array of control options offered by the keyboard and mouse.
Disciples II: Servants of the Dark,PC,Jun-30-2003,Strategy First,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Deeko,65,The single player mode is lacking in many ways and feels disjointed as if the missions should have just been in the original game.
Worms Blast,GameCube,Oct-24-2002,Team17,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,IGN,58,You can get involved in some pretty intense matches but the gameplay does not lend itself to be longlasting like some of the other addicting puzzlers out there.
Mega Man X6,PlayStation,Dec-4-2001,Capcom,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameShark,61,If youre a Mega Man fan then youve already purchased the game and have been playing to your hearts content. You can move on to other parts of the web-site.
ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2001,Konami,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,IGN,58,There are honestly a lot of things to like about this football game...[but] it just doesnt play enough like real football.
Tetris Worlds,Game Boy Advance,Sep-5-2001,3d6 Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,Nintendo Power,60,New variations make Tetris Worls a world of fun. [Nov 2001 p.148]
Razor Freestyle Scooter,PlayStation,Dec-11-2000,Shaba Games,Action | General,Gaming Age,67,RFSs gameplay is completely off the wall fun and despite its quirky premise kept me coming back for more time and time again.
Gunman Chronicles,PC,Nov-19-2000,Rewolf Software,Action | General | General,ActionTrip,69,If we take it for what it really is - a mod then one could label Rewolfs baby as a nice mod success story with mediocre retail reach and appeal.
Eat Them!,PlayStation 3,Dec-21-2010,FluffyLogic,Action | General | General,Everyeye.it,60,Eat Them! shows how Rampage worked only in the context of the penny arcade and in his time. The title of FluffyLogic fun and entertaining but the fun turns out to be ephemeral and not permanent.
Trillion: God of Destruction,PlayStation Vita,Mar-29-2016,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Vandal,65,Trillion: God of Destruction is an experimental RPG so it gets a few things right but misses a few others. Still if you connect to the characters its a good adventure that feels original within the genre.
Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns,DS,Jul-22-2008,Ninja Studio,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Roguelike,IGN,60,The gameplay visuals and style of the game have remained nearly identical to the previous package so while we like what we’ve played once again it’s undoubtedly more of the same.
007: Quantum of Solace,DS,Nov-4-2008,Vicarious Visions,Action | Action Adventure | General | Modern | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Pocket Gamer UK,60,Some nice ideas and a relatively fresh approach to the Bond franchise but there are just too many rough edges to the core action to recommend a purchase.
Fossil League: Dino Tournament Championship,DS,Jan-22-2007,MTO,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,62,Fossil League is essentially a Pokemon clone thats pretty decent on the surface but lacks the depth features and polish of the original monster-battlers. [May 2007 p.85]
Eternal Poison,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2008,Flight-Plan,Strategy | General,GamePro,70,The gothic-anime art direction and voice acting are impressively well-done and although the painfully long load times hinder the general flow of the game-play the overall game-play soundtrack voice acting and art direction makes up for the technical deficiencies.
Axis & Allies,PC,Nov-2-2004,TimeGate Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,GameSpot,60,The single-player portions of the game are ridiculously easy even on the hard settings. Only a few campaign missions are remotely challenging and even these cases are due to poor AI with Allied forces.
Journey of a Roach,PC,Nov-4-2013,Koboldgames,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Gameblog.fr,60,Quotation forthcoming.
MotoGP 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-28-2008,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Gameplanet,65,An inauspicious beginning for Capcoms new motorbike series that has little to offer even committed fans.
Dig Dug: Digging Strike,DS,Oct-18-2005,Bullets,Action | Platformer | General | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Game Chronicles,61,There just isn’t all that much substance and certainly no flash with Namco’s latest retro invasion on the DS.
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts,PlayStation 4,Nov-22-2019,CI Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,XGN,65,While its shooter mechanics and open mission structure make the game fun to play. There are also plenty of technical flaws or poor design choices that ruin that same fun experience. Glitchy maps weird AI movements and a poor story make this shooting adventure feel mediocre instead of great.
Battle Princess Madelyn,Switch,Dec-20-2018,Causal Bit Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,60,Battle Princess Madelyn is not without its problems. While its arcade mode is easily the most enjoyable it also ends up defeating the purpose of including a metroidvania component in the game. With a high difficulty level and some memorable cut scenes it also has some gameplay issues that require solving and which stand on the way of making this a more recommended title.
Poi: Explorer Edition,Switch,Oct-23-2017,PolyKid,Action | Platformer | 3D,COGconnected,65,I was looking forward to reviewing Poi: Explorer Edition as a game that channels the old-school 3D adventure game I loved so much as a child sounded like a great thing. However this game is less a channeling and more a full emulation of one of those older games. It’s good for some fun though that fun won’t last long. It’s not completely broken but the minor issues can add up in a hurry. There’s some enjoyment to get out of Poi: Explorer Edition but it’s more of a nostalgic trip to a more innocent time than anything noteworthy in the present.
Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,Namco Bandai Games | Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,ZTGD,65,I was glad to see that SAO:HF was able to put forth a more earnest effort with its improved translation and gameplay tweaks but when it’s all said and done it’s still not a particularly good game.
Fairy Fencer F,PlayStation 3,Sep-16-2014,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,IGN Italia,61,Made with impeccable richness and dolled up with cut-scenes and distracted fine ladies the new Compile Heart JRPG is not fully convincing presenting a solid gameplay without a challenge equally worthy. And in the absence of this balance Fairy Fencer F loses a lot of biting especially in the second half of the adventure.
A Virus Named TOM,PC,Aug-1-2012,Misfits Attic,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,Gamer.nl,65,A Virus Named Tom is a nice puzzle game as a snack. Its structure is simple and it never gets very complicated. Still theres enough challenge in this relatively short game and the multiplayer lifts it to greater heights. Unfortunately the versus and coop modes are only playable locally and for a PC-game thats a giant waste.
Shotest Shogi,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2008,AI Factory | Rubicon Development Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,60,Itll be big in Japan; over here not so much. [Christmas 2008 p.94]
007: Quantum of Solace,PlayStation 3,Nov-4-2008,Treyarch,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GamingExcellence,64,For Bond fans the complicated controls lack of an original story and mediocre graphics may cool the ardor for owning any and all Bond-related products.
Barnyard,Wii,Dec-4-2006,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action | Adventure | General | General,GameDaily,60,Regardless of its shortcomings Barnyards mini-games and activities on the farm make it worth at least a rental. Just accept the fact that bovines ride bikes and mix drinks.
Pac-Man World 3,Xbox,Nov-17-2005,Blitz Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Game Informer,63,The dialogue is actually charming and sometimes clever but the loose controls found in the main game also plauge the arcade port to a degree which to me is the biggest bummer of this outing. [Jan 2006 p.138]
Dynasty Warriors 9,PlayStation 4,Feb-13-2018,Omega Force,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 3D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,This is a big game. Sadly its not all of the highest quality. Sometimes less is more. [March 2018 p.94]
Super Motherload,PlayStation 4,Nov-15-2013,XGenStudios,General | Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action,GamesRadar+,60,Super Motherloads premise of digging for richs on a lonely planet sounds about as boring as actually digging for richs on a lonely planet. But stick with it long enough and youll find an eerily soothing adventure with addictive strategy elements that make for a wholly enjoyable next-gen gaming experience.
SingStar Dance,PlayStation 3,Nov-1-2010,SCEE London Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Dancing,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),60,Were convinced that theres nothing brilliant about the SingStar series. And yet Dance is a good time. [Jan 2011 p.84]
War the Game,PC,Jan-12-2015,GabberGames,Strategy | Real-Time | Military,SpazioGames,70,Going beyond the minimalist technical sector this is an absolute deep wargame despite the extremely simple gameplay. Its all about the ideas that underlie it that as in the best milestones pass over all the rest to give a deep and original product like few others.
MachiaVillain,PC,May-16-2018,Wild Factor,Action | General,COGconnected,66,Ultimately MachiaVillain needs a lot of cleaning up explanations and balance fixes. Then maybe we can all come together to have a bloody good time.
Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D,3DS,Jun-28-2011,Capcom,Action | Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Shooter | Survival | Third-Person | Tactical,Digital Spy,60,While Resident Evils gameplay is a little on the clunky side today its still wholly enjoyable and packed with thrills and its just a shame that its short-lived and awkward to get to grips with.
Cate West: The Vanishing Files,Wii,Mar-23-2009,Destineer,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,GameSpot,60,If youre itching to play a hidden-object game The Vanishing Files will be like rubbing up against a tree: its not pretty but it gets the job done.
Birthdays the Beginning,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Arc System Works,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon | Action Adventure | Sandbox,Eurogamer Italy,60,We cannot say that Birthdays is one of the best God-game available. The ground modeling represents basically the whole gameplay. For the rest of the time you will stand still waiting for the life to blossom.
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,Xbox,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Armchair Empire,67,Gladiator was on its way to becoming the sleeper hit of 2003… then the gameplay threw it into the bargain bin.
EyePet & Friends,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,SCEE London Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),60,We occasionally encountered some control issues. [Jan 2012 p.81]
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands,PSP,May-17-2010,Ubisoft Quebec,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,65,The well-designed levels in The Forgotten Sands do a good job of sucking you into this 2D world but minor control issues and lame combat distract from the fun.
The Escapists: The Walking Dead,Xbox One,Sep-30-2015,Team17,Action | General,Brash Games,70,A great title that remains true to the source material and one that fans of both the Escapists and the Walking Dead will love. Whether the daily grind of washing dirty clothes and working out in the gym will be for everyone else is another question but this unusual and unique take on one of TV’s bests is at the very least a fun and challenging RPG.
Exit 2,Xbox 360,Feb-25-2009,Taito Corporation,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,IGN,65,Exit 2 doesnt feel like a sequel as much as more levels with a few added twists. All of the issues from the original are back: The controls are awkward. The pacing is horrid. The AI needs work. But hey at least a good number of the puzzles are interesting and there are a lot of them.
M.A.C.H. Modified Air Combat Heroes,PSP,Feb-20-2007,VU Games,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Other,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Theres just no lasting appeal. [Apr 2007 p.97]
Help Wanted: 50 Wacky Jobs,Wii,May-12-2009,Hudson Soft,Simulation | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,65,Do minigames become more playable when coupled with a story that would have cinema goers lobbing popcorn at the screen? Answer: not really. [May 2009 p.60]
Gauntlet,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,Digital Eclipse,Action | General | General | Arcade,IGN,60,Visually and aurally the game is pretty much the same as before. Of course running the game on an HD set will make it sharper but this game still looks and sounds much like it did in 1985.
Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain,PlayStation 2,May-4-2004,Sony Bend,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,Game Power Australia,65,If the control had been more intuitive and the combat had been tightened up the game could have been more enjoyable but as things stand most should give Sonys new shooter a wide birth.
Lords of the Realm III,PC,Mar-17-2004,Impressions Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General,IGN,64,Without offering a little more depth to either the tactical or strategic aspects of the game were left with two experiences that are integrated well enough but leave us wanting more.
Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus,Xbox,Mar-18-2003,Studio Gigante,Action | Fighting | 3D,G4 TV,60,Its not deep or particularly innovative. However the detailed graphics familiar gameplay and wide variety of characters and game modes make this brawler worth a look.
Strike Fighters: Project 1,PC,Oct-27-2002,Third Wire,Simulation | Flight | Old Jet | Combat,GameSpy,60,Clearly missing some pieces but the product may be salvageable.
S.W.I.N.E.,PC,Nov-19-2001,Stormregion,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Tactics,Game Over Online,64,A funny but repetitive (and eventually tedious) real-time strategy game.
Tennis Masters Series,PC,Nov-18-2001,Microids,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,Computer Games Magazine,60,The game could have been stellar but it falls flat in one critical area. You never ever hit a ball out.
Hoard,PC,Apr-4-2011,Big Sandwich Games | Inc.,Action | General | General,Gamekult,60,Quotation forthcoming.
Juiced: Eliminator,PSP,Jun-28-2006,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GameSpy,60,Its too bad the core driving model is so flawed since Juiced could have been a lot more fun with either tighter handling or more spacious course designs.
Party Hard,PlayStation 4,Apr-26-2016,Pinokl Games,Action | General,Brash Games,50,Party Hard is not a bad game by any means but it’s just not a particularly fun one. Without that addictive ‘one more go’ feeling that other games of its ilk employ so effectively Party Hard becomes much more of a chore than a game about murdering a drunken party should.
MS Saga: A New Dawn,PlayStation 2,Feb-21-2006,Bandai,Role-Playing | General,Gaming Horizon,62,I remain unimpressed by MS Saga: A New Dawn as well as the Gundam series its based upon. While Bandai has crafted a playable game with some points of enjoyment the majority of its content is extremely dull and flat.
Away: Shuffle Dungeon,DS,Oct-30-2008,Mistwalker | Artoon,Role-Playing | General | General,1UP,67,Shuffle Dungeons strength lies in its level designs which are cleverly crafted so as to force tough choices at the spur of the moment. The limited structure grows a bit long in the tooth once youve been playing for a while...but even so it never stops pushing you to make those snap decisions.
Wild West Guns,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Gameloft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,1UP,58,Considering the production values and repetition Wild West Guns is probably pushing it with a $10 price point but for those looking to swap their virtual crossbow for a slightly less-enticing six-gun this throwback shooter very nearly justifies the investment.
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PSP,Dec-11-2005,Crave,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,IGN,65,It certainly falls short on some of the presentation points like its minimalist character creator and restrictive Career mode options but its AI and fairly cool RPG elements make it stand out from the portable crowd a bit.
Crash 'N' Burn,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameSpot,67,Unfortunately some of Crash N Burns central ideas--the persistent wrecks being the most obvious example--introduce complexity that in the end will leave you more frustrated than thrilled.
Need for Speed Underground 2,DS,May-10-2005,EA Canada,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Nintendo Power,60,The mixture of shame and frustration it instills will make you raise your eyebrows turn on your heels and snicker as you walk away. [July 2005 p.99]
Painkiller: Overdose,PC,Oct-26-2007,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,60,The Painkiller series has indeed overdosed and should have been stopped after the first two games.
Bee Simulator,Switch,Nov-12-2019,Varsav Game Studios,Simulation | General,Pure Nintendo,60,Bee Simulator’s flying mechanics will frustrate younger gamers and its grade-school level presentation will turn away adults. If you’re able to find some happy ground between the two of them however it’s a thoughtful educational and fun way to live out the life of a bee.
Morphite,Switch,Nov-2-2017,Crescent Moon Games,Action Adventure | General,Switch Player,58,Morphite is a space exploration adventure that does well in creating the feeling that you’re visiting its many alien worlds. With a unique low poly style it falls short for having poor and inconsistent combat. Those that can overlook this will find a deep and enjoyable journey.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,DS,Nov-14-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,netjak,65,For every new innovation solid gameplay design and visual accomplishment there’s another half-hour of gameplay that seems just like the last.
Arena Football,Xbox,Feb-7-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,GameShark,58,Despite the fact that the game has a franchise mode of sorts (you sign free agents in the off season rather than holding a draft) this isnt the kind of game that youll most likely play multiple seasons as you would Madden or NCAA unless youre simply a die-hard Arena League fan. The game simply doesnt have the legs for it.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1: In Too Deep,Xbox One,Feb-23-2016,Skybound LLC | Skybound Games,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,COGconnected,65,In Too Deep isn’t by any means terrible it just doesn’t feel as original or as interesting as it should. It’s also quite possible that I’m simply over-saturated with The Walking Dead in general right now.
Sparkle 2,Xbox One,Jan-27-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Puzzle | Matching,Brash Games,60,Sparkle 2 is not a game that is going to keep you entertained forever but as a stand alone puzzle game it’s a great time filler amongst the other titles that you may be wanting to play.
Prince of Persia Revelations,PSP,Dec-6-2005,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Fantasy | Linear,IGN,60,While the scope and impressive design of the game remains intact theres a myriad of technical issues that rob much of the enjoyment. Everything from the visual presentation down to the core gameplay has been adversely affected in the transition from consoles to a portable system.
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2005,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,PALGN,60,The fact that it was finished last year and released in Japan in 2004 and left until now with no changes is just one of god’s mysteries.
Outward,Xbox One,Mar-26-2019,Nine Dots Studio,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Survival | Open-World,Official Xbox Magazine UK,60,A tense and immersive adventure – but with one too many rough edges. [Issue#177 p.85]
Choplifter HD,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2012,InXile Entertainment,General | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Eurogamer Sweden,60,An attempt to bring a classic game to a new audience that early on looks like a solid and fun game but after a while shows its not so polished design. What was addictive and challenging in the early 1980s does not fly today. The somewhat cluncky unprecise controls and inconsistent difficulty level makes Choplifter HD a games that initially lifts off with confidence but crashes halfway through and never really gets some air beneath its rotors.
Cookie & Cream,DS,Jul-2-2007,Hi Corp,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Nintendo Power,65,If you crave innovation and have the patience to deal with Cookie & Creams shortcomings the title offers a creative charming and mostly satisfying adventure. [July 2007 p.93]
Secret Files: Tunguska,Wii,Jun-22-2010,10tacle Studios | Fusionsphere Systems,Adventure | Third-Person | General | Modern,AceGamez,60,There are problems but fans of the genre will be able to look past these imperfections and see that this is a far superior game to Agatha Christie. But even so this is still an average game especially when compared to the best of the Wii library.
Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon,PC,Aug-21-2008,Kheops Studio,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,Game Over Online,62,Almost nothing about the game is fun or enjoyable -- the puzzles are a chore the storyline is presented badly and even the ending is annoying -- and so I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody unless for some reason you like being lost and confused.
The Awakened Fate: Ultimatum,PlayStation 3,Mar-17-2015,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | General | Roguelike,Slant Magazine,60,It leans firmly enough on its heaven-or-hell selection phases to make an impact in both the immediate and distant future of its gameplay.
Blacklight: Tango Down,PC,Jul-14-2010,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,65,Blacklight: Tango Down is a decent cheap multiplayer shooter for the budget-minded gamer looking for a change of pace.
Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,PC,Jun-10-2016,Frogwares,Adventure | General,GRYOnline.pl,65,Sherlock Holmes: The Devils Daughter is an uneven game. Making Sherlock younger and having him take part in action scenes was a good idea but the execution is poor at best. Still there are some excellent mini-games interesting investigation and a truly great deduction board. If only the game handled its characters better it would be glorious. The end result is ok but the potential is far from being fully realized.
Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond,PlayStation 3,Jan-7-2010,Vicious Cycle,Action | Action Adventure | Modern | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GameSpot,60,This satirical shooter is fun but it never takes advantage of the potential of its parodies.
Blair Witch,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Good ideas are undermined by overuse and a lack of tension but Blair Witch does leave you thinking ‘What if?’ and demands to be replayed . [Issue#171 p.97]
Metal Wolf Chaos XD,PC,Aug-6-2019,From Software | General Arcade,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,PC Invasion,70,Metal Wolf Chaos XD isnt particularly lengthy or challenging but its very entertaining and downright hilarious. As long as youre okay with playing whats mostly a straight port of an Xbox game from 2004 theres a good time to be had here.
Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 2,Xbox One,Feb-5-2019,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Jeuxvideo.com,60,Milestone is obviously on the good path. Monster Energy Supercross has many things to improve on but there’s at least an interesting Career mode and more realistic driving.
Smash Hit Plunder,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,Triangular Pixels,Strategy | General,COGconnected,60,SHP may provide a diversion to youngsters for a short while but everyone else will quickly wander off for more fulfilling experiences. It’s a shame too because the tone and look of SHP deserve a better game.
Gekido: Kintaro's Revenge,Switch,Mar-22-2018,Naps Team,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Cubed3,60,It may be a mediocre brawler of its time but it does have a certain energy to it and the light adventuring elements do make it unique from anything else of its ilk. The bonus dungeon mode is the real main attraction and playing with a friend makes things more interesting. Kintaros Revenge can only be recommended though to gamers who understand that this is a port of a Game Boy Advance title that has not had much done to its presentation.
Human: Fall Flat,Switch,Dec-7-2017,No Brakes Games,Action Adventure | General,IGN Spain,60,An experiment made video game. A strange but fun experience that gains whole thanks to its physics engine and a hilarious cooperative mode.
Star Wars Battlefront II,PC,Nov-17-2017,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Quarter to Three,60,Oh and my sweet Lord this game does wonders in the space battles department. You’ll fly around Star Destroyers and through Death Star debris zipping between laser blasts and missiles. Eventually just as in Galactic Assault in Starfighter Assault games you’ll spawn in hero ships like the Millenium Falcon and Slave I. Or that one green ship that looks like a bathtub turned upside down. Is it Bossk’s ship? Regardless you can fly in it if the cool ships are taken.
Xenoraid,PlayStation 4,Nov-8-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons Ltd | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Everyeye.it,60,A traditional vertical shooter with a single good idea but many gameplay flaws restrained by an anonymous and unattractive look.
Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,ACE Team,Action Adventure | Linear,GamingTrend,65,Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition is fun at times but ultimately an unsatisfying affair.
War for the Overworld,PC,Apr-2-2015,Subterranean Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Classical gameplay is wonderfully revived with new features and dressed in a modern jacket. Unfortunately technical aspects and other issues undermine the games legs. [Issue#252]
Rio,PlayStation 3,Apr-12-2011,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Miscellaneous | General | General,Gamereactor Denmark,60,A better party game than we expected but not quite as good as it could have been. The joy you get from the bubly music and colorful graphics fades away once youve reached the end of the minigames and see how much they recycle their ideas.
Rogue Ops,GameCube,Oct-29-2003,Bits Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,GamingWorld X,69,And while Rogue Ops is still often a blast to play the game’s lack of polish and numerous minor frustrations noticeably hamper the solid if somewhat derivative gaming experience that lies underneath.
Summer Heat Beach Volleyball,PlayStation 2,Jul-1-2003,Acclaim Studios Cheltenham,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,GameNow,67,What it lacks in curves and naughty bump-mapping it makes up for in sheer gameplay. [Sept 2003 p.54]
Gungrave,PlayStation 2,Sep-16-2002,Seta Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Playboy,65,Suave and stylish courtesy of character designs by famed anime artist Yasuhiro Nightow (Trigun) its unfortunately far too short underwhelming and the general aesthetic is liable to be beyond the comprehension of anyone who couldnt tell a Gundam from a gumball.
Mad Maestro!,PlayStation 2,Mar-12-2002,Desert Productions,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,After a few songs keeping tempo and varying the strength with which you hit a single button gets pretty old. [May 2002 p.101]
Darkened Skye,PC,Jan-27-2002,Boston Animation,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Fantasy,Adrenaline Vault,60,If you can get past the monotonous arcade elements theres a lot that the title has going for it including imaginative characters and a script bordering on hysterical.
Monsters Inc. Scream Team,PlayStation,Oct-30-2001,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General,TotalGames.net,58,A deeply unsatisfying experience although younger players may have some fun just running around as Mike and laughing at his crazy antics.
Thunderstrike: Operation Phoenix,PlayStation 2,Oct-15-2001,Core Design Ltd.,Action | Simulation | Shooter | Flight | Third-Person | Helicopter | Modern,GameZone,59,A game that suffers from could have been great syndrome. The weapons are cool and the missions are exciting but the controls ruined everything.
Yoshi's New Island,3DS,Mar-14-2014,Arzest,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cheat Code Central,62,Yoshi has had some grand adventures of his own but sadly this is not one of them.
Alpha Protocol,PlayStation 3,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,GameSpot,60,Alpha Protocols astounding intricacies are tarnished by bugs clumsy gameplay mechanics and rough production values.
Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2014,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Shacknews,60,Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn is sure to be a welcome return for some but the rust is clearly showing on this series.
F1 2015,Xbox One,Jul-21-2015,Codemasters,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,MondoXbox,69,F1 2015 lays good foundations for the series future on new consoles but it still needs a lot of work. Too many bugs and the absence of the Career mode one of the most loved in previous games make it hard to suggest it even to the biggest Formula One fans.
Monopoly Streets,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,Electronic Arts,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Absolute Games,60,If you love Monopoly but couldnt care less about online play get a 2008 version. It makes no sense to pay extra for pretty much the only new feature.
Danger Zone,PC,May-29-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,GameSpot,60,The old magic of Crash Mode rises to the surface often enough for Danger Zone to be a fun diversion but this excitement is ironically muted when the game decides to turn up the intensity in its later levels.
Diner Dash: Sizzle & Serve,DS,May-23-2007,Climax Group | PlayFirst | Climax Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General | Action,GamesRadar+,60,Most levels in Diner Dash: Sizzle and Serve last five minutes tops which makes it a flexible on-the-go offering. We’re increasingly annoyed by publishers’ tendencies to toss a casual PC game onto portable consoles for a notably higher price than its PC version.
Mario Party 7,GameCube,Nov-7-2005,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Party,N-Europe,60,Basically Mario Party 6 but with less fun and [fewer] new ideas.
Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis,PC,Oct-29-2009,Fusionsphere Systems | Animation Arts,Adventure | General | General,Vandal,60,Ultimately if Secret Files was a surprise for its good presentation and story this sequel was expected to follow its trail. However this Puritas Cordis shows it is not enough to reuse the same formula over and over.
Spyro: A Hero's Tail,Xbox,Nov-3-2004,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,TeamXbox,64,A Heros Tail does a good job at starting to expand Spyros world in a few new directions with additional playable characters but its just a start.
Onimusha Tactics,Game Boy Advance,Nov-11-2003,Capcom,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,60,If youre looking for a game that wont overtax your brain then OT is the way to go.
AO Tennis 2,Switch,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,Nintenderos,60,A port that doesnt stand out in the graphic and technical section. However its gameplay is wonderful for lovers of pure and realistic tennis.
Bloo Kid 2,3DS,May-7-2015,winterworks,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameCrate,65,While the game borrows some of the best elements from Mario and Kirby (among others) it also suffers from some nasty issues of its own. The unpredictable nature of the games obstacles and artificial difficulty do more harm than good resulting in a product thats only good for short sessions rather than simply being an overall great game.
Naval War: Arctic Circle,PC,Apr-10-2012,Turbo Tape Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General,Eurogamer Italy,60,Not a deep RTS game but a little bit more complex than a casual game Naval War is an average title. It can be funny but out there there is for sure something better.
Go Vacation,Wii,Oct-11-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Nintendojo,58,As a mini-game compilation Go Vacation falls short of the standard set by Wii Sports Resort due to its middling selection of activities and its frustrating motion controls; as a sandbox game however it fares significantly better offering up four expansive resorts to explore and a myriad of collectibles to find. While its extensive use of gesture commands nearly ruins the entire experience there is still quite a bit of fun to be had with the title particularly if you have a companion to share it with.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Autobots,DS,Jun-23-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Adventure | Shooter | Beat-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person | 3D | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,64,Though the game moves in a completely linear fashion with quite a few missions that arent very enjoyable to run through there are other elements of the game that are admittedly compelling and addictive.
Gear.Club Unlimited,Switch,Nov-21-2017,Eden Games Mobile,Action | General | Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Vooks,60,Ultimately Gear.Club Unlimited may have been better served doubling down on either the arcade or the simulation aspects of driving not both. In attempting to do both Gear.Club Unlimited stretches too thinly in trying to cater to both crowds creating a merely serviceable package filled with content brought down by unsatisfying driving.
Lucky's Tale,PC,Mar-28-2016,Playful Corp.,Action | Platformer | 3D,Multiplayer.it,63,Though Luckys Tale is a decent platformer its too short and doesnt have original ideas. But its for free so go and download it.
Crystal Quest,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2006,Stainless Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameSpot,62,A solid game that could have used some better presentational aspects. When put up against the surprisingly deep competition for this style of game on Xbox Live Arcade it falls a little flat.
Atari Classics Evolved,PSP,Dec-19-2007,Stainless Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Console Gameworld,60,A pretty standard classics collection. On its own its exceedingly average but if youve got a soft spot for one or more of these games the awards might make it worth your time.
Dusk Diver,PlayStation 4,Oct-29-2019,JFi Games,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,RPGamer,60,Dusk Diver inevitably invites comparisons to both Persona and Yakuza. Yet this isn’t necessarily a bad thing as while it doesn’t have the thematic aspirations of the former or the writing and attention to detail of the latter the decent combat and low-key charm make it an overall pleasant experience that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Just keep in mind that it is very much cotton candy instead of a full-course meal.
Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2012,Pyramid,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Digital Chumps,62,I think passionate series fans whether Budokai veterans or not will appreciate the Collection but they may also question why a more thorough and complete version wasnt released.
Conduit 2,Wii,Apr-19-2011,High Voltage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer Portugal,60,The Conduit 2 is a significantly improved experience over the previous game though without adding anything new.
Defiance,PC,Apr-2-2013,Trion Worlds,Massively Multiplayer Online | Role-Playing | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Everyeye.it,65,Defiance fails in the difficult task of merging a TV series and a video game in a convincing and engaging way.
Battles of Prince of Persia,DS,Dec-6-2005,Ubisoft Montreal,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,Computer Games Magazine,60,It’s all in the cards. Play the campaign to earn them and then use them to build your decks. [Mar 2006 p.91]
Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Aspyr | Aspire,Action Adventure | Linear,Worth Playing,60,At its core Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast remains a good title. Get past the shooting and youre rewarded with a ton of Force powers and lightsaber combat that remains at the top of its field to this day. However the port job isnt up to snuff as it lacks some slight auto-aim and lock-on to make the experience more user-friendly for console players so the opening levels are a real chore to get through even if you can handle the outdated textures and adherence to the old way of doing puzzles. Not only is it recommended to go with the PC release for this title but it also gives one pause about how the eventual port job of Jedi Academy will turn out.
Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters: Daybreak Special Gigs,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Arc System Works | Now Production,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Gameblog.fr,60,Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters Daybreak Special Gigs is a superb Visual Novel with a good OST and original novel mechanics... But the tactical phases are boring and ugly and the story isnt that good.
Master of Orion 3,PC,Feb-25-2003,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | 4X,Adrenaline Vault,60,The elements for a great game are present but the focus and execution of those elements is not.
Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts,Xbox 360,May-17-2011,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,GamePro,60,Its a fair package -- more expansive than Dead Money but not quite as rich as Point Lookout which is the current gold standard for Fallout DLC. And of course its a long way from the expansion packs of yore where $30 could occasionally yield what amounted to an entirely new game. Ten dollars is a fair price for what Honest Hearts brings to the table but its ultimate appeal is down to whether or not youre still in the middle of a campaign. As it is this four hour romp through Zion National Park isnt quite worth dusting off your seven-month old copy of New Vegas.
Cargo! The Quest for Gravity,PC,Apr-21-2011,Ice-Pick Lodge,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | General | Fantasy,GameStar,64,Theres that feeling that I should have fun playing the game but most of the time Im bored or angry because the controls are buggy. But if you like to be creative maybe youll be happy in this colourful world.
theHunter: Call of the Wild,PC,Feb-16-2017,Expansive Worlds,Sports | Individual | Nature | Hunting,Everyeye.it,63,Quotation forthcoming.
StarDrone,PlayStation 3,Apr-5-2011,Beatshapers,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,64,While there isnt a whole lot you can do with a control scheme as simple as this StarDrone manages to add new challenges and interesting twists right up until the very end. Add some trophies to the mix and despite its flaws StarDrone is a pretty decent value for eight dollars.
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2004,Interplay,Role-Playing | Action RPG,G4 TV,60,When you play it in bite-size sessions youll appreciate wading into a sea of overgrown beetles or phosphorescent foes spiked baseball bat swinging. Despite a few design shortfalls the gameplay succeeds admirably as does its presentation.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,PlayStation 2,Dec-8-2003,Paradigm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Armchair Empire,63,The part of the game that annoyed me the most - long range combat.
Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm,PC,Sep-26-2002,3DO,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General,netjak,70,A fine piece of work but a little hastily put together...Due to the lack of a random map generator and due to the limited replay value of the maps the most you can get from the expansion is a week of playing.
ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,GameSpot,64,While Konami has toned down the simulation elements of Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002 so that it will appeal to a broader audience the challenging controls and plodding snowboarder mode will turn off all but the most ardent snowboarders.
Silent Scope 2: Dark Silhouette,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2001,KCET,Action | Shooter | Rail,Yahoo!,60,There arent really enough features here to recommend Silent Scope 2 to anyone other than those who are maniacally obsessive about the game ...or those rich I-Link-two-big-TVs-in-the-same-room-owning-people.
Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff,PlayStation 2,Apr-18-2001,New World Computing,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG,GamerWeb Sony,55,While some hardcore gameplay fans may appreciate the purity of this experience the plot and lack of characters is so glaring I find it hard to believe even so-called hardcore gamers wont find it annoying.
Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business,PC,Nov-30-2000,Sir-Tech Software Inc.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | Tactics,Computer Games Magazine,70,Delivers its moneys worth for true fans of the series but which is much too hard for anyone not utterly devoted to Jagged Alliance.
Assassin's Creed Liberation HD,PlayStation 3,Jan-14-2014,Ubisoft Sofia,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,PSX-Sense.nl,60,The PlayStation Vita version is faithfully ported to the PlayStation 3 and as it turns out does not make as much of an impression on the big screen. Ubisoft tweaked the free-running and combat aspects of the game though didnt bother fixing bugs and other shortcomings. Graphically its a totally expected letdown.
UEFA Euro 2012,PC,Apr-24-2012,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,Games.cz,50,A sloppy job done by the developers of Euro-licensed UEFA Euro 2012 is nothing more than an over combined gaming mode with the Czech national team. If you truly dont long for new graphics and the logo of this years European Football Championship save your money and keep playing FIFA 12.
We Cheer 2,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Machatin | Inc.,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,Digital Chumps,64,I think this game will satisfy the majority of the target audience with its customization options and modes of play. There arent a lot of songs here but the game is done well enough in every other respect to help make up for that.
Murder in the Abbey,PC,Aug-26-2008,Alcachofa Soft,Adventure | General | General,Absolute Games,64,Alcachofa Soft managed to produce only a half of a potentially great adventure. And I mean it literally - the two opening chapters are so different than the last two that you won’t believe your eyes.
Wild ARMs XF,PSP,Mar-11-2008,Media Vision,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,GamePro,60,Theres no doubt that Wild Arms XF is best left for hardcore fans of the series who will probably be more forgiving of the games faults; the rest of you should look elsewhere for your tactical RPG fix.
The Sinking City,PlayStation 4,Jun-25-2019,Frogwares,Action Adventure | Survival,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Weaves Lovecraftian mythos into an interesting setting. But it frequently veers into being dull and repetitive which isn’t what you want from dreamlike horror. [Issue#165 p.89]
Corruption 2029,PC,Feb-17-2020,The Bearded Ladies Consulting,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,GameSkinny,60,Corruption 2029 is a competent tactical game that leaves you wishing it had spent just a little more time in development.
Urban Trial Freestyle,3DS,Jun-27-2013,Strangelands Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Driving | Racing | General | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Nexus,65,If you’re looking for a portable Trials game Urban Trial Freestyle isn’t a bad alternative. However the track designs could have been a little better and I’m appalled at the lack of multiplayer. A motocross game is a perfect example of a game to play with friends but apparently the developers didn’t think so.
The Legend of Korra,PC,Oct-21-2014,PlatinumGames,Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,GameStar,60,A solid core of action and an entertaining fight mechanics cant save the game from being mediocre.
Pressure,PC,Mar-26-2013,Chasing Carrots,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,DarkStation,60,All that being said the core of Pressure is a fun ride. Good mechanics go a long way towards making a great action-racer but the bumps along the road end up bogging this down at the end of the race.
Dragon Age II: Legacy,Xbox 360,Jul-26-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Action RPG,GameTrailers,59,Legacy is full of good intentions but the final presentation feels bland and rushed.
MXGP Pro,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Gamer.nl,65,MXGP Pro does not really deliver when it comes to game modes and presentation but it does have a good approach in physics and the versatility of this racing sport.
Chasing Aurora,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Broken Rules,Action | General | Flight | Flight,GameOver.gr,60,Chasing Aurora should be played by you and your friends then and only then it can deliver any amount of fun.
Deadcore,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2017,Grip Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameGrin,60,DeadCore is a challenging puzzle-platformer that really demands a high skill level of its player base. Visually is it incredibly uninspired and overly busy in places which can make the occasional frame drops quite frustrating. The mix between first-person shooting mechanics and freerunning platforming make the game a blast to play. For those who want a challenging platforming title on the PS4 DeadCore is right up your alley. For casual gamers out there I would recommend going elsewhere.
Sonic Heroes,PlayStation 2,Jan-27-2004,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Electronic Gaming Monthly,67,As with the previous two 3D Sonic outings Sonic Heroes is a solid platformer that couldve been a lot better if the developers had spent more time balancing the levels and tweaking the unbelievably frustrating camera. [Feb 2004 p.108]
Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness,GameCube,Sep-11-2002,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,Electronic Gaming Monthly,60,Its a simple concept that offers a fun twist on the falling-block model of a Tetris or Doctor Mario. [Oct 2002 p.194]
Triple Play 2002,Xbox,Mar-18-2002,Pandemic Studios,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Sim,Xbox Nation Magazine,60,As ugly as a Tim Wakefield knuckleball. [Spring 2002 p.91]
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PlayStation,Nov-15-2001,Argonaut Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Electric Playground,60,A PlayStation game that will disappoint Potter fans around the world with its bland graphics blocky characters lifeless locales frustrating challenges and uninspiring gameplay.
Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open,Xbox,Nov-14-2001,Rockstar San Diego,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Game Revolution,58,Excellent physics and suspension aggressive opponents and humongous and well-planned environments give a bit of shine to a game that is otherwise strictly last generation.
4x4 Evolution,PlayStation 2,Feb-26-2001,Terminal Reality,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Maxim Online,60,The game’s lack of realism (your cars can’t get damaged or dirty) takes away from that devilish feeling that you’re doing something naughty with the family car.
Gunbird 2,Dreamcast,Nov-17-2000,Psikyo,Action | General,Game Revolution,67,The game is really really hard but thats the nature of this genre. I just wish that there were more rewards for my efforts; it feels almost pointless to try so hard.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD Ver.,PlayStation 3,Aug-21-2012,Capcom,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,GameOver.gr,60,Its strange bizarre some would say but this old fighting game from Capcom still has some life in it. Too bad its way too overpriced.
Sid Meier's Pirates!,Wii,Sep-28-2010,Virtuos,Strategy | General | General,Level7.nu,60,Sid Meiers Pirates for Wii is partially a missed opportunity. The games a classic on PC but the Wii version feels a little unessecary since the new functions for this console doesnt add much to the experience. Theres a lot to do in this game and it can get you quite hooked but it could have been done much better.
SimCity,PC,Mar-5-2013,Maxis,Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,Post Arcade (National Post),60,You soon realize that control like your city isn’t all its built up to be. So much has been smoothed out that it doesn’t always feel like you’re running the show.
Gods Will Be Watching,PC,Jul-24-2014,Devolver Digital,Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,God is a Geek,60,Where Gods Will Be Watching is really testing though is in its almost impenetrable difficulty. There’s a fine line between challenge and frustration and sadly with all of its positives Gods Will Be Watching will leave you questioning whether its really worth it.
Planet of the Eyes,Xbox One,Sep-12-2017,Coco Cucumber | Cococucumber,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameGrin,60,This title is pretty and has decent platforming despite not pulling the player in or offering challenging puzzles. Simply put it does as much right as it does wrong. It’s short but it doesn’t overstay its welcome due to that. It’s too easy but it makes for a nice quick completion when you’ve got some extra time. Might not be a bad idea to wait for a sale and complete it in only a little bit more time than it takes to download.
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,PC,Oct-3-2012,Arkedo Studio,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Riot Pixels,60,Hell Yeah wouldve worked much better if it were a comic book or an animated movie. It is eye-catching and crazy just to the right degree but alas so primitive as a game.
Of Orcs and Men,Xbox 360,Oct-24-2012,Cyanide | Spiders,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG | Western-Style,GameSpy,60,Keep in mind that this isnt an everymans game -- its linear levels the absence of bundles of loot and even the quirks of its combat whittle down its potential audience -- but theres a lot to love about how this RPG sings the glories of the underdogs.
The Lord of the Rings: Tactics,PSP,Nov-8-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,Next Level Gaming,65,This game is simply trying to cash into the Lord of the Rings franchise so lets be smart enough and not fall for that old trick just walk on buy this one on the store shelves.
Musashi: Samurai Legend,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,Despite Musashis quirky look and interesting mechanics the elementary mistakes made with the camera and the poor pacing ultimately make the game feel more like its 1998 predecessor than a modern sequel.
SpongeBob Squigglepants 3D,3DS,May-17-2011,WayForward,Miscellaneous | General | General,GamePro,60,SpongeBob SquigglePants has a few problems that can be justified -- the lack of impressive 3D effects doesnt sting since the game includes a variety of cool art styles and the games derivation from the WarioWario formula can be forgiven since the core gameplay is entertaining. Unfortunately theres no good reason for the games biggest problem: the extreme dearth of content. At $40 theres not nearly enough of SpongeBob SquigglePants to justify a purchase.
Restaurant Empire II,PC,May-26-2009,Enlight Software,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,69,Restaurant Empire 2 is a little tricky to evaluate. On one hand you’re getting two games that give you glimpses of what it’s like to run dining establishments both of which manage to essentially get the job don and pack in a story to boot.
Disney*Pixar WALL-E,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Heavy Iron Studios | Savage Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameZone,50,But the game itself is not rewarding. The game is like so many with a license attached little more than a rental youll quickly forget.
Hardwood Hearts,Xbox 360,Dec-8-2005,Silver Creek Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Board / Card Game | Gambling,GameSpot,61,Hardwood Hearts is a Hearts game for Hearts fans. If you dont already play Hearts you arent likely to get much out of this one.
SIMULACRA,Switch,Dec-3-2019,Kaigan Games OU,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,Twinfinite,60,Its story is creepy and unpredictable with the variety in gameplay keeping you engaged even if it drags towards the end.
Snooker 19,PlayStation 4,Apr-16-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,TheSixthAxis,60,Snooker 19 is a solid snooker simulation that will definitely appeal to fans of the sport. The relative lack of modes and some major oversights do hold it back and so it is difficult to recommend unreservedly. It might be Lab42s first attempt with the official license but right now Snooker 19 feels too much like style over substance. Not so much a 147 as a battling 50 ending in an unfortunate in-off whilst amongst the reds.
The Council - Episode 5: Checkmate,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,XGN,60,The final episode of The Council differs from the other episodes in tone and length and is kind of a let down. It is too short and there are too many abrupt changes in Checkmate to conclude it in a satisfying way.
Grand Ages: Medieval,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2015,Gaming Minds Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General,PSX-Sense.nl,65,An elaborate strategy experience hurt by mediocre graphics and a disappointing fighting system. Its a shame we cant properly read the letters on the screen either.
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,By far the biggest blot on WRCs copybook is the lack of variety on display. [Dec 2011 p.114]
Alien Breed 3: Descent,PC,Nov-17-2010,Team17,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,SpazioGames,65,Its still a good game but this third chapter should have been something more in terms of new ideas and polishing.
Kholat,PC,Jun-9-2015,IMGN.PRO,Fantasy | Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Gamer.nl,60,The world of Kholat is magnificent but the promises of a cool story and memorable gaming experience do not really come true. Using the map and compass are fun but frustration and boredom are near. Too bad because especially the Dyatlov Pas-incident is a good subject for a game.
Sid Meier's Starships,PC,Mar-12-2015,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,IGN,65,Sid Meier’s Starships’ battles held my attention for a handful of games after which point the tactical AI’s behavior became exploitable and the strategic layer became too muddled and unpredictable.
Infliction: Extended Cut,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2020,Caustic Reality,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Malditos Nerds,60,The biggest flaw in Infliction: Extended Cut are its similarities to so many other games. Many of its mechanics and design decisions have already been seen but players who love horror will be hooked by its creepy atmosphere and story.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,PC,Jun-30-2009,EA Bright Light,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer.nl,60,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will give fans some enjoyment but it doesnt offer much challenge and the story is told in a lackluster way. However the games visual presentation is impressive and the offered mini-games are fun to play.
Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species,PC,Oct-19-2005,Blue Fang Games,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,65,There are some good additions but stuff that I would have expected to be added on top of a different major theme. I guess when it comes to zoos its a little harder to find new topics for great expansions.
Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight,PlayStation 4,Jul-7-2017,Artdink,Role-Playing | Action RPG,The Games Machine,65,Accel World VS Sword Art Online has a decent and enjoyable combat system but everything else is definitely sub-par: the graphics seems to be coming from the previous PlayStation and the world is dull and pretty anonymous. Probably slightly more interesting if youre a fan of the series.
Yosumin! LIVE,Xbox 360,May-27-2009,Square Enix,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Edge Magazine,60,The concept at the core of Yosumin Live is robust but it fails to hold up under extended play. Either Square Enix has happened upon a brilliant mechanic that has yet to fully bloom or one that it has been unable to sustain. The scant progression Yosumin has made in its transition from webgame to XBLA release indicates that perhaps it is the latter.
SingStar ABBA,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2008,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,GamesRadar+,60,We applaud the focus but the flip side of that is a narrower market and decreased value to those of us who don’t know which of the ladies is Anni-Frid Lyngstad and which is Agnetha Faltskog. Knock it down to $20 and we’ll talk.
Call of Duty: Roads to Victory,PSP,Mar-13-2007,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GamesRadar+,60,The game is still playable although not without its frustrations. And seriously why bother giving us an accuracy percentage when aiming is nearly impossible. Thats like yelling at an arthritic waiter for spilling your soup. But the wonderful presentation COD fans have come to expect is intact and the game visually translates unimpeded.
Wheelman,Xbox 360,Mar-24-2009,Tigon | Midway Studios - Newcastle,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Gamer.nl,60,Wheelman is best described as a B-movie. Bad production values and a lousy script. However the funny one-liners bad dialog and over-the-top action make up for lost ground. Wheelman is by far a good game but still a very enjoyable one.
Wavey The Rocket,PC,May-7-2020,UpperRoom Games Ltd,Action | General,DarkZero,60,When it’s all said and done my main quarrel with all of these issues is that they are holding this super concept back from reaching anywhere near its potential and it’s just such a shame to see. Wavey The Rocket has its ups and downs it’s crests and troughs if you will but it is still a good game at its core. There are just a few rough edges that need to be worked on and status quos to break free of. Instead of trying to fit this new idea into an established space like a wavey peg into a conventionally-shaped hole I wanted to see it go further to think bigger!
Danger Zone,PlayStation 4,May-30-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,IGN Spain,60,Short not very beautiful and with a lot of room to improve but still fun while we wait for a new Burnout game.
Redeemer,PC,Aug-1-2017,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,GameOver.gr,60,It’s a pure beat ‘em up game with satisfying and fast combat albeit without any effort to provide anything we haven’t seen before. Its repetitive nature goes without saying raising the guilt part of this guilty pleasure offering exponentially with each passing hour.
STRAFE,PC,May-9-2017,Pixel Titans,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Gameplanet,60,Strafe isnt bad but there are many better ways to satiate your nostalgia for 90s FPS titles.
Townsmen: A Kingdom Rebuilt,Switch,Nov-9-2018,HandyGames,Strategy | General | Management | Government,Nintenderos,52,Townsmen allows us to manage our village not only against the invading forces but also against the different natural forces such as storms or snow avalanches. Despite this the title is somewhat monotonous and has boring loading screens.
The Town of Light,PC,Feb-26-2016,LKA,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Edge Magazine,60,For all its faults theres every chance The Town of Light could end up getting under your[ skin]. [April 2016 p.112]
X-Men: The Arcade Game,PlayStation 3,Dec-14-2010,Konami,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Age,67,So yeah X-Men is a game with limited appeal to very particular niche but its something Im personally extremely happy to have and its nearly identical to what I played in the Arcade.
Van Helsing,PlayStation 2,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Stuff,60,The convoluted control scheme outlined in the manual leads you believe you can pull of coolly calculated combinations (isnt alliteration fun!) but the action quickly devolves into button-mashing confusion.
Mace Griffin Bounty Hunter,Xbox,Jun-20-2003,Warthog,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,netjak,60,Isnt the greatest game ever made but it certainly isnt the worst. I personally had a very good time with it and recommend it to anyone looking for a good solid singleplayer FPS fix.
Global Touring Challenge: Africa,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2002,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Play Magazine,60,All the basics are in place competently attended to and the visual presence is extremely strong – little details like an amazing waterfall and dense environment effects continually impress. [June 2002 p.55]
WWE WrestleMania X8,GameCube,Jun-9-2002,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Into Liquid Sky,58,Single player matches can be fun except when getting into multi-opponent matches where the computer decides that youre always the odd-man out. Youll be screaming for blood when its you versus three opponents.
Forever Kingdom,PlayStation 2,Jan-21-2002,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameSpot,63,A game with no real outstanding qualities. That said if the core gameplay is enough to hold your interest and if you enjoy collecting rare items the game may be worth a purchase.
Floigan Bros. Episode 1,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2001,Visual Concepts,Action | General,Hot Games,60,Impressive for its visual and audio style these Brothers need more help in the gameplay department if they hope to become a franchise.
Gradius III and IV,PlayStation 2,Nov-13-2000,KCET,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,GameSpot,63,Konamis sights may be locked dead on the retrogaming audience but Gradius III & IV are both excellent albeit incredibly difficult games in their own right.
We Happy Few,Xbox One,Aug-10-2018,Compulsion Games,Action Adventure | General,TrueAchievements,60,If We Happy Few had all of these problems while in Xbox Game Preview and a pre-release state youd be more likely to excuse it but its rare to encounter so many issues in a full game release. While none were game breaking they spoil what can be a decent game with a unique world interesting characters and a convincingly damning depiction of the perils of taking hallucinogenic drugs. Its a world to which you want to return but its also a world that throws up a new problem with every visit. With several patches this game could be a fun experience but right now it can often be an exercise in frustration.
Micro Machines V4,PlayStation 2,Jun-27-2006,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Games Master UK,65,Tiny-car heaven cant make up for a game that feels a bit wimpy next to bigger racers. [Aug 2006 p.79]
Legend of Kay Anniversary,PC,Jul-27-2015,Neon Studios | Kaiko,Action Adventure | General | Linear,Ragequit.gr,65,Legend of Kay Anniversary is a genuinely fun action platformer that is let down by its outdated visuals annoying camera and clunky control system. There are hours of fun to be had here but make sure you have a decent gamepad and you adjust your expectations accordingly. It is after all still a 2005 game at heart.
Major League Baseball 2K9,Xbox 360,Mar-3-2009,2K Sports,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Official Xbox Magazine,65,The laundry list of annoying little problems is too substantial. [Apr 2009 p.76]
Party Hard,PC,Aug-25-2015,Pinokl Games,Action | General,games(TM),60,When you’ve wasted 15 minutes watching two pixel people chat each other up but never move to the bedroom to seal the deal; it’s these scenarios where getting caught by the cops or feds becomes a frustration instead of a punishment. It’s almost like some people don’t want to get murdered. Rude.
BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II,3DS,May-31-2011,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Everyeye.it,60,BlazBlue Continuum Shift II shines in its gameplay but fails in every other aspect due to the many flaws of a lazy porting.
Disgaea Infinite,PSP,Jun-8-2010,Nippon Ichi Software,Adventure | General | General | Visual Novel,Digital Chumps,60,A visual novel on mobile platform seems like a match made in heaven but Disgaea Infinites cumbersome interface and reliance on repetition render it more flawed that fascinating.
RiME,Switch,Nov-14-2017,Tantalus | Tequila Works,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,Vooks,60,Overall RiME is a delicately-constructed experience sprinkled with beautiful moments on the proviso you play the game exclusively docked to the TV. However you should consider playing RiME on another platform to avoid the myriad technical and visual issues that come with the Switch port.
Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix,Switch,Nov-8-2018,RideonJapan |Inc.,Action | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,Switch Player,60,Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix is a fun tactical game that is ultimately let down by its stereotypical plain characters and a dull storyline. Fans who appreciate strategy should give it a try but shouldn’t get their hopes up for anything beyond the game being good.
Batman: The Telltale Series,PC,Aug-2-2016,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Riot Pixels,60,Its a game for Batman fans who really dont care about the form. Or for fans of Telltales products who arent picky about the content.
Alien Breed,PlayStation Vita,Feb-12-2013,Team17,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Digital Spy,60,The enhanced visuals and local and online co-operative multiplayer are welcome additions but everything else feels a little bit outdated with a distinct lack of variety in enemies and objectives in particular making the levels bland and monotonous by todays standards.
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight,PC,Mar-16-2010,EA LA,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Eurogamer,60,Its nothing at all like Command & Conquer but - eventually - its a thoughtful and bombastic multiplayer RTS thats welcoming to everyone.
The Saga of Ryzom,PC,Sep-20-2004,Nevrax,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Games Radar,64,A slow starter. However its a huge world which is full of big ideas. Jump in now for a game that promises to be an interesting take on a staid genre - or hold fire a month or two to see how it lives up to its promises. [PC Gamer UK]
Mad Riders,Xbox 360,May-30-2012,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,GameWatcher,65,Mad Riders borrows a little too liberally from other titles to truly have its own identity. What is there however is an enjoyable enough arcade racer.
Need for Speed Undercover,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2008,EA Vancouver,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,3DJuegos,64,Need for Speed Undercover is one of the biggest bluffs of this final quarter of 2008. Far from catching the spirit of Most Wanted the game of Black Box fails in its proposal because of an excessively easy campaign and because of its shock-car style driving.
Warframe,PlayStation 4,Nov-12-2013,Digital Extremes,General | General | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,GameTrailers,60,With an asking price of nothing it’s not unreasonable that Warframe charges for things but when the game’s main hook is getting more loot it slowly becomes frustrating running into so many roadblocks. Even with your warframe’s athletic prowess the nondescript missions don’t offer enough to put up with the waiting and there certainly isn’t a strong reason to part with a credit card.
Ghostbusters: The Video Game,PlayStation 2,Jun-16-2009,War Drum Studios,Action | General,GamesRadar+,60,Ultimately this game is a true celebration of all things Ghostbusters and fans shouldnt wait to get this if the PlayStation 2 is all they have. For those with little love for the series its still a good action game even if the no-frills levels and abbreviated campaign are bound to leave you feeling like youre sitting at the kids table while the adults feast.
Phantasy Star Universe,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2006,Sonic Team,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameDaily,60,On paper expanding upon each aspect of the well-received Phantasy Star Online appears attractive yet a shoddy execution lacks the finely-tuned balance the game was known for.
Armored Core: For Answer,Xbox 360,Sep-16-2008,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Game Informer,63,Basically play it for the multiplayer or don’t play it at all.
The friends of Ringo Ishikawa,Switch,Apr-3-2019,yeo,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Pure Nintendo,50,While the concept of an open world beat ‘em up set in high-school sounds interesting the way it was executed is far from perfect. Furthermore the entire world feels meaningless as there is no way to easily tell what time your classes begin and where they are. It is also difficult to know where each building is in the world because The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa lacks a map/compass feature. If you are looking for a unique beat ‘em up and are willing to manage it’s user experience issues then this is a perfect game for you.
Seasons After Fall,PlayStation 4,May-16-2017,Swing Swing Submarine,Action | Platformer | 2D,Video Chums,65,Seasons After Fall is a beautiful game to look at and listen to but it can often be tedious to play due to its insistence on repeated backtracking and general lack of guidance. There are some endearing moments throughout its confusing story but the amount of running back and forth between them makes it questionable whether theyre worth the effort of uncovering.
The Baconing,Xbox 360,Aug-31-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Action RPG | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine UK,60,Itd make a great TV show though. [Nov 2011 p.107]
Vikings: Wolves of Midgard,Xbox One,Mar-28-2017,Games Farm,Role-Playing | Action RPG,SpazioGames,60,Vikings Wolves of Midgard is a passable Diablo clone full of fresh ideas for the genre none of which really fits into the gameplay let down by repetition and peculiar game design choices. There are far better similar games on Xbox One and its very hard to recommend this one over Diablo III Bastion or Hyper Light Drifter.
NASCAR: The Game 2013,PC,Jul-24-2013,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,Hooked Gamers,65,If you are a casual racing fan or someone who has not played a racing simulation with any regularity NASCAR 2013 is not the game for you. The lack of a comprehensive tutorial pretty much prevents you from gaining any sort of entertainment out of it past the first hour or two. But if you are a fan of NASCAR and its simulations or if you have plenty of experience with racing simulations I think you will be able to look past the obstacles and find a relatively enjoyable game within.
N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure,Xbox One,May-15-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Miscellaneous | Adventure | Puzzle | General | 3D | First-Person,Vandal,60,Nero is an interesting adventure but it has very important technical issues that make it feel worse than it is at its core.
Sea of Solitude,PC,Jul-5-2019,Electronic Arts | Jo-Mei Games,General | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,PC Gamer,64,Sea of Solitude is a gorgeous adventure that knows its way around mental illness but doesnt make great use of the medium to tell its story.
Kholat,PlayStation 4,Mar-8-2016,IMGN.PRO,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,XGN,65,Kholat could have been an amazing game but it just isnt. Its based on a true story and looks great. The game start really good but then slips away in boredom. The tension it needs just fades away really quickly.
The Crew,Xbox One,Dec-2-2014,Ubisoft Reflections | Ivory Tower,GT / Street | Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | Automobile,COGconnected,60,It pains me to say it seeing as I had such high hopes but The Crew missed its mark by a long shot and just barely chugs over the starting line.
Tiger Woods PGA Tour,DS,Dec-14-2004,Sensory Sweep,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Sim | Sim,GameZone,68,Some people will absolutely love what this game has to offer but for the most part I think gamers will be more frustrated then thrilled.
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,PSM Magazine,60,Theres nothing wrong with early retirement....youve earned it Spyro. [Dec. 2006 p.82]
Academy of Champions: Soccer,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,Nintendo Power,65,Obviously Academy of Champions: Soccer is not a game for hardcore footie fans but those looking for a pick-up-and-play soccer game should give it a try. [Dec 2009 p.86]
Moons of Madness,Xbox One,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,SomosXbox,59,Moons of Madness is a game of light and shadow. Its setting is superb but it drowns in an excessively cryptic story and in a boring gameplay.
Sleep Tight,Switch,Jul-26-2018,We Are Fuzzy,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Worth Playing,60,In the end Sleep Tight means well but is very limited in scope. The core mechanics are fine and the different upgrade trees are good but the slow difficulty ramping can make it feel like a grind in a short amount of time. The lack of any modes hurts significantly as does the lack of variety in locations and your arsenal. Unless you want something simple in your tower defense or twin-stick shooting game its easy to pass on Sleep Tight in favor of other titles.
Disney/Pixar Ratatouille,PSP,Jun-26-2007,Locomotive Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameZone,62,The PSP version of Ratatouille hardly feels like much of a morsel and compared to the far superior console version this will be a disappointment for anyone who fell in love with the movie.
Batman Begins,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2005,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Edge Magazine,60,Where the game really succeeds however beyond providing a robust and solid if unassuming model of explorative stealth and attack is in fulfilling that old and oft-forgotten criterion - putting the gamer inside the movie. [Aug 2005 p.95]
Carve,Xbox,Feb-24-2004,Argonaut Games,Driving | Racing | Snow / Water,games(TM),60,Youll get most out of the game on Xbox Live. Working alone or with friends Carves online races are unique as the properties of water allow for some novel gameplay. By crossing in front of rivals you can create waves that make life more difficult for them - something that works particularly well when working as part of a team. [Feb 2004 p.120]
Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction,Xbox,Jul-30-2003,Zono Inc.,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi,Village Voice,60,Or better yet take advantage of the games slightly flawed design and go Predator slaughtering the weaker species.
X-Squad,PlayStation 2,Oct-23-2000,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,PSX Nation,50,Rent it beat it forget it ever existed and start drooling over the upcoming Winback remake.
Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault,PlayStation 3,Nov-27-2012,Insomniac Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameOver.gr,60,QForce is quite enjoyable and with the budget price it comes with can certainly be recommended to fans of the franchise. But its not a proper R&C game and certainly not the ideal way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Insomniacs beloved duo.
Yakuza: Dead Souls,PlayStation 3,Mar-13-2012,Ryu ga Gotoku Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Gamer.nl,60,A zombie-outbreak in the Yakuza makes for a fresh change of pace. Unfortunately that really says it all because Dead Souls misses the nuance and class of previous installments. Its not even the presentation or story but mostly the game mechanics that disappoint. Shooting zombies is what youll be doing most in Dead souls and by the end of the game youll long for the regular Yakuza experience.
ADR1FT,PC,Mar-28-2016,Three One Zero,Action | Action Adventure | General | Survival,games(TM),60,A game that succeeds in being like no other but falls short of realising its potential.
Chaos Wars,PlayStation 2,May-30-2008,Idea Factory,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Gaming Age,58,If youre a big fan of these niche style games then it should be right up your alley. Nothing else about Chaos Wars really stands out the graphics are 2D on a 3D plane and look well enough but the music isnt really exceptional stuff.
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III,PC,May-22-2015,NeocoreGames,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameWatcher,60,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 3 is a good-looking game but the lack of features from the previous entries are a sore point
Super Lucky's Tale,Xbox One,Nov-7-2017,Playful Corp.,2D | Action | Platformer | 3D,New Game Network,65,Super Luckys Tale looks and sounds pleasant and its charming world and characters will appeal to younger audiences. However despite getting the basics right some gameplay and overall design concerns lead the game down a few wrong foxholes.
Cold War,PC,Sep-27-2005,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Chronicles,65,Its gameplay and graphics are good but it does not stand out in any major way.
Snooker 19,Switch,Aug-23-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Digitally Downloaded,60,For the very small niche of people who care that much about Snooker however Snooker 19 does deliver. There are more accessible Pool titles out there - including on the Nintendo Switch itself but as an attempt to go the full distance with a deeply authentic simulation Snooker 19 is a good and genuine effort.
Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs. Sasuke,DS,Nov-12-2010,Takara Tomy,Action | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Worth Playing,65,Fans will definitely get some enjoyment out of this title but its going to fall a little flat for everyone else.
Officers,PC,Jul-14-2009,3A Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,DarkZero,60,This is one of the worst types of tragedies that can befall a game – to be brimming with potential and fun gameplay only to get ruined with technical blunders.
Zombie Driver HD,Xbox 360,Oct-17-2012,EXOR Studios,Action | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,Its straightforward meaty gameplay but the lack of multiplayer feels a little brain-dead. [Issue#92 p.87]
Crash Twinsanity,PlayStation 2,Sep-28-2004,Traveller's Tales,Action | Platformer | 3D,PSM Magazine,60,Though the game looks and controls well levels appear to be designed to kill the player in as many cheap ways as possible. [Dec 2004 p.78]
MX vs. ATV All Out: Anniversary Edition,Xbox One,Feb-26-2019,THQ Nordic,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,XboxAddict,60,For someone that wants to experience the chaos of MX bikes racing alongside ATV’s and even UTV’s MX vs ATV All Out Anniversary Edition will scratch that itch. It’s a shame that not all of the DLC is included in this version but the ones that are will add a decent chunk of gameplay to keep you busy for a few extra hours. While nowhere near a perfect experience it can be fun in short doses and allows an accessibility for newcomers to the series and genre to enjoy while having a decent amount of depth and replayability for veterans.
Darksiders III,PlayStation 4,Nov-27-2018,Gunfire Games | THQ Nordic,Action Adventure | Open-World,New Game Network,60,Severe performance problems and a misguided implementation of Souls mechanics in Darksiders 3 tarnish an otherwise perfunctory but at least occasionally enjoyable return to one of last generations better action series.
RymdResa,PC,Aug-20-2015,Morgondag,Role-Playing | General,Brash Games,60,Despite its flaws RymdResa offers a mostly relaxing experience and is something a little different from the norm.
Hydrophobia: Prophecy,PC,May-9-2011,Dark Energy Digital,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Third times the Charm – first time it was XBLA Hydrophobia then the game was released again as Pure and now weve got Prophecy. Enough tries we say. [July 2011]
Intellivision Lives!,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2003,Realtime Associates,Miscellaneous | Compilation,IGN,60,The amount of games and the retrospective elements: good. The horrible controls: extremely bad.
Worms: Open Warfare,DS,Mar-22-2006,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Artillery,IGN,60,The PSP group - internal Team 17 developers - clearly had a lot more interest and fun working on its rendition of Worms because this DS game while holding some of the originals charm looks like it was handled by a weekend port crew.
Storm,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,EKO Software,Miscellaneous | General | General,Eurogamer Sweden,60,Storm offers a charming puzzle experience but it relies too much on agility and timing and too little on well crafted levels.
TNA iMPACT!,PlayStation 3,Sep-9-2008,Midway Studios - Los Angeles,Action | Sports | Fighting | Fighting | Individual | Wrestling | Combat | Wrestling,IGN,64,TNA iMPACT! had a lot of potential but it didnt follow through on most of it. Beyond the limited/repetitive moves lackluster CAW and scaled back online my main problem is that iMPACT! doesnt feel like real wrestling.
RPG Maker Fes,3DS,Jun-27-2017,Jupiter Corporation | Kadokawa,Role-Playing | General,God is a Geek,60,RPG Maker FES really wants you to make the games you want but doesn’t want to help you out in any way.
nail'd,Xbox 360,Nov-30-2010,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gamereactor Denmark,60,A blistering fast and high flying off-road racer with no intentions of anything resembling realism. But while it can be fun for a quick romp it lacks in both the variety and challenge departments. Too shallow to entertain for more than a few hours.
Killer Is Dead,PlayStation 3,Aug-27-2013,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Stylish and most of the time entertaining as well this carnage from the mind of a well known weirdo designer Suda 51 doesnt bring anything new to the table except for its bizarre aesthetics that may or may not suit you. [Issue#234]
Arc Rise Fantasia,Wii,Jul-27-2010,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GamePro,60,If the only system you have is a Wii and you need an RPG this certainly isnt a bad title to settle for. For gamers with more console options however the enjoyment youll derive from Arc Rise Fantasia will likely be tied to how much you like combat since the story certainly isnt anything worthwhile.
Exit DS,DS,Nov-5-2008,Moss,Action | Puzzle | General | General,GamesRadar+,60,Your characters will not do what you want them to a decent portion of the time.
Track Lab,PlayStation 4,Aug-21-2018,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,Worth Playing,55,Track Lab is an interesting title. If youre looking at it as a game it has some great puzzle mechanics but theres only enough content to last you about an hour unless you get stuck on one of the puzzles. If youre looking at it as a music creation tool the interface is novel but not something youll use to seriously create tunes especially since theres no easy way to export your creations. Ultimately Track Lab is more of a fun toy in VR but not something youll be itching to visit more than a few times.
Rainbow Skies,PlayStation 4,Jun-26-2018,SideQuest Studios,Role-Playing | General,God is a Geek,55,A disappointing sequel that fails to recapture the magic of its predecessor.
King Oddball,Xbox One,Sep-9-2016,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Action,COGconnected,60,Although King Oddball is repetitive and becomes frustrating with poor level design and the reliance on luck over strategy there are a few redeeming factors including additional game modes that actually make the game a decent value for the price. For less than $5 you can play an indie version of Angry Birds with controls that are even more simple.
Thor: God of Thunder,DS,May-3-2011,WayForward,Action | General | General,Metro GameCentral,60,Gorgeous 2D art still cant forgive the needless repetition but while the novelty lasts this is a great little brain dead brawler.
Cranium Kabookii,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,NintendoWorldReport,60,Cranium Kabookii is fun for a time but only if youve got a large group of people or big family to play it with. That makes it a good rental game but not much else.
Star Trek: Tactical Assault,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,62,A one-trick pony that boils down to the same basic maneuvers and slow-paced combat. It also horribly overlooks its license. Youll deal with Klingons and Romulans but the dull story and unrecognizable characters could have been used in any generic intergalactic setting.
Avatar: The Last Airbender,DS,Oct-10-2006,TOSE,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,AceGamez,60,I am left in a bit of a conundrum - here is a game where I barely passed the first boss battle and neither of my kids were able to defeat that first boss (my older son would have managed eventually it but after about twenty minutes he wanted to get back to Pokémon Ranger and didnt care if he ever saw Avatar again!)
Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue,GameCube,Aug-16-2005,Xpec,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,60,Its actually fun for someone who A.) Loves Hello Kitty B.) Hates alien invaders and C.) Loves to kill aliens while on roller skates.
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,PC,Nov-10-2004,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Cheat Code Central,60,Overall the gameplay is far too simple for any casual gamer but its sure to keep kids entertained even if they havent seen the movie or read any of the novels.
Wrath Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Feb-10-2004,Double Helix Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Gamer's Pulse,54,Its aspects of action while moderately engaging are wholly unbalanced; in addition the elements of strategy are watered-down for ease of play.
RoadKill,GameCube,Oct-30-2003,Terminal Reality,Driving | Car Combat,Electronic Gaming Monthly,62,As a car-combat game its passable but not exceptional. As a postacopalyptic GTA clone it falls well short of the mark in terms of story mission diversity and replay value. [Nov 2003 p.171]
Pro Rally,GameCube,Nov-11-2002,Ubisoft,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,GamerWeb Nintendo,65,Its a little schizo trying to tread the line between arcade racer and sim but its much more of an arcade style experience on the whole.
Superman: Shadow of Apokolips,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2002,Atari,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GamePro,60,It’s disappointing when a game finally nails the hard parts of reproducing Superman (the powers) but blows it with ho-hum missions and repetitive gameplay.
Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates,Game Boy Advance,Apr-30-2002,RFX Interactive,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Informer,60,Beautiful background details dull play. [July 2002 p.87]
Wild Wild Racing,PlayStation 2,Oct-25-2000,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Happy Puppy,60,While the graphics and the sound are on point the game as a whole is weak.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood,PlayStation 4,Jul-26-2019,MachineGames,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Wccftech,60,Wolfenstein: Youngblood just never finds the right groove. The game’s needless RPG elements microtransactions and sloppy non-linear structure are obvious mistakes but it also has some surprising basic level design and pacing problems. Wolfenstein: Youngblood can still be good visceral fun in fits and starts but overall the game lacks the maturity of the elder Blazkowicz’ adventures.
Juiced,PC,Jun-13-2005,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Pelaaja (Finland),60,Juiced has many interesting features but they all have been seen before in the games it shamelessly imitates. The game has interesting characters and good career-mode but why bother when there are better games to choose from? [June 2005 p.62]
The Adventures of Tintin: The Game,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2011,Ubisoft Montpellier,Adventure | General | General,GamesRadar+,60,Even though it has its flaws The Adventures of Tintin never veers from decent to awful and Ubisoft Montpelier deserves credit for creating a rare wonder - a movie-spinoff that doesnt completely suck.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,PC,Jun-25-2007,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer,59,Die-hard Potter fans will thrill throughout to checking Hogwarts huge and detailed environs but Order of the Phoenixs repetitive gameplay will make many wish someone would cast an Avada Kedavara spell in their direction and put them out of their misery already. [Oct 2007 p.66]
Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2011,Vicious Cycle,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,60,Im honestly astounded as to how any game can be so good and so bad at the same time.
Dead Island: Definitive Collection,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,Techland,Miscellaneous | Compilation,PlayStation Universe,60,A reasonably-priced pair of remasters that actually do improve upon the original games plus you get a surprisingly decent bonus title in the mix too. Sadly while technical hiccups are stifled in the main games many of the mechanical flaws remain with the passage of time not helping matters. This means Dead Island is better than its ever been but a lot harder to enjoy than it once was.
The Witch and the Hundred Knight: Revival Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Worth Playing,60,If you dont mind the quirks and rough attempts at humor then you may enjoy The Witch and the Hundred Knight.
198X,PC,Jun-20-2019,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,AusGamers,64,The simplicity of 198X is endearing and how it presents a compilation of sorts of an era is something that leaves a positive if not lasting impression. The story although simple in its presentation does leave room for growth. We’re keen to check out the second part of the tale and if the team Hi-Bit Studios can connect both the narrative and the individual games in a more meaningful way - then it has every chance to live up to its premise.
The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer,Xbox,Nov-1-2005,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN,60,Its a short simple ride. The Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer offers decent fun for younger kids but the action and puzzles wont challenge older gamers.
Suikoden IV,PlayStation 2,Jan-11-2005,KCET,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Electronic Gaming Monthly,60,Relocating Suidodens established gameplay to the vast and choppy seas doesnt do it any favors - instead of exploring diverse geography on foot youre steering a boat across a bleak boring ocean. [Feb 2005 p.108]
Supreme Ruler: Cold War,PC,Jul-19-2011,BattleGoat Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,SpazioGames,60,A deep and profound strategic title wich fails to deliver mainly due to a lame user interface lack of tutorial questionable AI bad graphics and boring moments. The multiplayer fails to save it. Its definitely better to look elsewhere into the Paradox portfolio with better more refined titles as Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis.
This Is the Police,PlayStation 4,Mar-22-2017,Weappy Studio,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life | Career,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,A game as flawed as its protagonist. [May 2017 p.96]
Neon Chrome,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,DarkStation,60,All in all I enjoyed my time with Neon Chrome. It delivers the basics of why I like twin-stick shooters and adds its own mark with an emphasis on strategy and a cool cyberpunk theme. Granted the game has a few shortcomings such as a non-existent story and sub-par graphics as well as being rather short and having no online co-op but if youre looking for something easy to pick up and play (especially with a friend) you could definitely do a lot worse!
FIFA Street 2,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,60,You might have some fun if all you care about is channeling your grade-school hacky-sack sessions but if youre looking to actually play street soccer youll wonder why your soccer pitch turned into a circus act. [Apr 2006 p.77]
Fallout 76: Wastelanders,PlayStation 4,Apr-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,GameCritics,65,Playing solo can still be entertaining but the moments of loneliness hang over the player like a cloud while they’re traveling from point A to point B. In the end it comes down to personal preference — some will enjoy the solemn journeys found in Appalachia while others will only play when friends are online but even without them the Wastelanders update is a step in the right direction.
Super Bomberman R,Xbox One,Jun-12-2018,Konami,Puzzle | Action | Arcade,SomosXbox,65,Super Bomberman R isnt the best game in the series but it offers a fun and entertaining challenge for all fans especially in its multiplayer mode.
Cubemen 2,Wii U,Sep-4-2014,3 Sprockets,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | General | Defense,Cubed3,60,Cubemen 2 is fun but its short-lived. The gameplay is relatively shallow (by necessity of the genre more than anything else) and theres little to do once the single-player campaigns are finished which doesnt take very long.
Necrovision,PC,May-18-2009,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PC Format,64,Were NecroVision to turn up on Steam for less than a tenner then itd be worth considering. [Apr 2009 p.99]
Worms Forts: Under Siege,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,games(TM),60,Forts Under Siege might have enough reward on offer but the series is still relying on gamers to meet it halfway by investing ample time and patience in learning its demanding intricacies. [Dec 2004 p.112]
Dirty Bomb,PC,Jun-1-2015,Splash Damage,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Digital Chumps,60,Dirty Bomb is a nice shooter that is a perfect F2P alternative to a lot of the major FPS titles out today. The game is still in beta however so there are a lot of features to be added and a lot of flaws to buff out. Hope that the devs can fix what needs to be fixed and polish this game to fulfill the potential it shows.
World Poker Tour,Xbox,Oct-18-2005,2K Sports,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,DarkStation,60,This budget game serves up some basic and ordinary poker action with decent Xbox Live support.
Moons of Madness,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,4Players.de,64,Visually impressive horror on Mars which takes inspiration from Lovecraft but unfortunately never manages to create panic for the player.
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,LucasArts,Action | General | General,Level7.nu,60,A major disappointment. We got a rush job with a game that is way too easy repetitive and frustrating at the same time. Star Wars fans might enjoy the act but wait until the price dropped.
Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom,Xbox One,Apr-28-2017,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object,TrueAchievements,60,After a great run of titles Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom doesnt quite match up to the standard of those that have gone before it.
Resident Evil 6,Xbox One,Mar-29-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,XBLA Fans,60,I dont think that there is really any new content here for fans who played the game comprehensively the first time around so it is those returning players who should consider their purchase most carefully.
Godzilla: Save the Earth,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Fighting | 3D,Xbox Nation Magazine,60,Its the brawling gameplay dragging things down. [Jan 2005 p.88]
FIFA Street 3,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,Good in the short term somewhat tedious in the long. [Issue#30 p.88]
Finding Nemo,Xbox,May-9-2003,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Xbox Nation Magazine,60,Surprisingly fun. [Aug 2003 p.87]
InnerSpace,Switch,Jan-16-2018,PolyKnight Games,Simulation | Flight | Civilian,Vooks,60,If you’re after game that’s unlike any others on the Switch and you’re after a flight game or just want to soak in the trippy visuals then InnerSpace has enough of both to enjoy. If you’re after a more traditional game then it becomes harder to recommend as all the ‘gamey’ elements are the most frustrating parts.
Dragon's Prophet,PC,Aug-13-2013,Runewaker Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy,JeuxActu,60,Seducing with its dragon theme free to play and quite well done as it even offers advanced housing Dragons Prophet is an MMORPG which does not look ridiculous. But we do have to admit that it lacks some punch to be able to compete against the genres stars because of poor polish an old graphics engine dull quests and a small amount of races and classes. We note that those drawbacks could be improved by an update overtime which allows us hope. But is trying Dragons Quest enough to get hooked? Not really but at least its free to try.
NBA 09 The Inside,PlayStation 3,Oct-7-2008,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,IGN,65,With a plethora of old bugs and issues rearing their head NBA 09: The Inside has a ton of problems that overwhelm the title. Its still a fun arcade-style basketball game but youre going to have to put up strange gameplay problems that have plagued the franchise for years and some unrealistic court play to fully enjoy it.
Shark Tale,PC,Sep-27-2004,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,IGN,65,It offers fun through various different game play styles and retains the hip style of the movie but the undercurrent of materialism is jarring.
X-Men: Next Dimension,GameCube,Oct-15-2002,Exakt,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,64,Even the most ardent X-Men fans should probably just rent Next Dimension rather than buy it.
Alpha Protocol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,Xbox World Australia,60,Alpha Protocol does many things right and succeeds where it count for an RPG but falls short elsewhere.
Spectrobes,DS,Mar-6-2007,Jupiter Corporation,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameSpot,60,As a scavenger sim Spectrobes absolutely succeeds but scouring every inch of planet after digital planet will quickly wear thin for most people.
PixelJunk 4am,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Q-Games,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Music Maker | Music Maker | Application,Eurogamer,60,4am is too obfuscated for serious music producers who will grow frustrated at the limited number of samples and the lack of visual feedback over which tracks and effects are active at any one time. And the experience is also too inscrutable for beginners who will find themselves lost in the matrix of noise unsure of how it may be truly directed or tamed. A fascinating toy then but a toy nonetheless.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India,PlayStation 4,Jan-13-2016,Ubisoft | Climax Studios,General | Action Adventure | Linear,Gameblog.fr,60,Assassins Creed Chronicles India offers a pleasant 2D stealth-action game but never manages to go much further.
Airheart: Tales of Broken Wings,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2018,Blindflug Studios,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,TheSixthAxis,60,Airheart presents an interesting idea with hints of brilliance but fails to deliver a game with staying power. Whilst the upgrade system is satisfying it’s let down by repetitive gameplay and UI issues that get in the way even when playing with the endearing crafting system.
DarkStar One: Broken Alliance,Xbox 360,Jul-13-2010,Gaming Minds Studios,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Metro GameCentral,60,It might not be the Elite sequel of your dreams but this space trader is in a field of its own on 360.
Big Bumpin',Xbox 360,Nov-19-2006,Blitz Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Gaming Target,54,Based on price alone it wouldn’t be far fetched to assume that the game is a one-trick pony but surprisingly there is a nice handful of minigames to test out.
Citadel: Forged with Fire,Xbox One,Nov-1-2019,Blue Isle Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Windows Central,60,Citadel: Forged with Fire is a good game but needs more polish.
Dogos,Xbox One,Sep-7-2016,INTERNET URL S.A.,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,ZTGD,60,A solid game that overcomplicates its genre roots with its unique twist. Production values are solid but also bland when considering this is a game with little diversity in the game play.
NBA 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2007,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,PSM3 Magazine UK,61,EAs more excessible and exciting Live is the team that makes the playoffs this year. [Feb 2008 p.78]
Windlands,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,COGconnected,64,The best compliment I can give Windlands is that for other developers there is a lot that can be gleaned from this experience soaring through the skies and the game is worth checking out for that reason alone.
Major League Baseball 2K8,Wii,Mar-3-2008,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,IGN,65,The lack of online 2K card system and minor league teams is a huge letdown though especially when you consider the Wii Connect 24 integration that could have allowed for live stat streaming updated trades (Santana is still on the Twins for example. Why?) and competitive stat tracking.
The World Next Door,Switch,Mar-27-2019,Rose City Games,Action Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,60,The World Next Door is not a title that’s going to rock anyone’s world but it’s a good title that would be worth checking out for someone wanting something a little different. The puzzle combat system is enjoyable but could have benefited from further development to flesh it out a bit more. The story isn’t extraordinary but is still an enjoyable journey despite its anticlimatic ending. The game takes about four hours or so to complete so it isn’t a huge time commitment. The world of Emrys is an interestingly designed world that can be fun to visit but is also not a bucket list destination.
Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,PlayStation 4,Feb-24-2015,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,CGMagazine,65,Koei doesn’t seem very interested in appealing to new customers because DW8 Empires assumes that you’re thoroughly familiar with not just the DW franchise but the Empires spin-off.
The Immortals of Terra: A Perry Rhodan Adventure,PC,Jul-3-2008,Braingame,Adventure | 3D | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person,GameZone,59,Only the most die-hard fans of the Perry Rhodan series will truly love this game. Others looking for a well-thought out and engaging adventure may want to look elsewhere.
NBA Live 07,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2006,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Sim,GameZone,67,While NBA Live 07 is a generally decent sports game with near-average replayability it doesn’t capture anything. You’ll be amused but not engrossed. It’s an update to last year’s game not a sequel.
Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings,PSP,Jun-9-2009,Amaze Entertainment | Amaze,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,Eurogamer Portugal,60,The game doesn’t present anything new being essentially aimed at fans of the series that will be entertained while playing this new adventure of Dr. Henry Jones.
Eragon,DS,Nov-14-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Action RPG | General | Fantasy | Beat-'Em-Up | Japanese-Style | 3D,GameSpot,64,Eragon is short and the touch-screen controls dont work very well but its still a fairly decent action adventure game.
Sniper Elite III,Xbox One,Jul-1-2014,Rebellion,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,If you live for the glory of the kill Sniper Elite III is the game for you just dont expect it to be routinely enjoyable. It can get a bit heavy. [Issue#114 p.72]
Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines,PSP,Nov-17-2009,Griptonite Games,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,D+PAD Magazine,60,Despite some obvious talent on the part of Griptonite Games Assassin’s Creed: Bloodlines smacks a little too much of an unloved unwanted by-product birthed from the success of the franchise.
Penny-Punching Princess,Switch,Apr-3-2018,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Switch Player,60,Penny-Punching Princess brings an interesting slant to the brawler genre one that sadly can become fiddly and repetitive over time. As a fairly expensive eShop title (physical release plans were scrapped at the last minute) it’s difficult to recommend a purchase here given what you could get for your money instead. Penny-Punching Princess is certainly not a bad game but it’s not a great one either. One to look for in the sales then where your calculator allows.
Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche,Switch,Apr-1-2020,WayForward,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,FNintendo,60,Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche is an unusual game based on the formula of a shootem-up but with plenty of elements of other genres and which does several things right - its original ideas humor-filled dialogue and colourful outlook stand out as its main assets. On the other hand its very short lifespan high selling price and rather quick way with which it will feel like a done experience will not attract many players to this new arrival on the Nintendo Switch catalogue.
The Godfather II,PC,Apr-7-2009,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Adventure | Third-Person | Historic | Linear | Open-World | Modern,SpazioGames,65,All in all The Godfather II goes on the same path of its predecessor: funny gameplay but repetitive cool design but graphics look old. You can squeeze the best out of it while managing your rackets but the fun won’t last long and won’t leave much behind when it’s over.
Bounty Hounds,PSP,Sep-13-2006,Xpec,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Game Informer,63,In short theres fun to be had here if youre willing to put up with the stuff that sucks. [Nov. 2006 p.146]
Call of Juarez: The Cartel,PlayStation 3,Jul-19-2011,Techland,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gaming Age,42,The single best feature in Call of Juarez: The Cartel is the ability to play through the entire game in co-op.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,Boring and uninventive zombie smasher is as bad as it looks like. [Issue#208]
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Official Xbox Magazine,35,Even with the Quest Mode’s extra goals the game felt too simple for its own good. Extra value should’ve come from the online modes but horrific lag rendered them unplayable and there’s no offline multiplayer.
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Vandal,45,Infinity Runner tries to adapt a mobile concept to new platforms but it just doesnt work as it should. Its just a different take on a mobile game but if youre ok with that then itll satisfy you.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameSpot,40,The very definition of a stripped-down budget title as practically every aspect that would make a game fun or interesting is missing.
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Impulsegamer,36,I wanted to like this so badly and was truly excited for it. I hate to say this but it is a waste of your time and money. Give this one a miss.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,The A.V. Club,42,Most of the trucks ride like they should be carting oranges or vending-machine refills instead of chasing bandits. Pushing them down the road with a keyboard aint much fun—and driving eats up almost all of your playing time.
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,VGPub,36,A bottom of the barrel poker game. It does have some cool things that most other poker games don’t like craps and sports betting but the bad far outweighs the good. Avoid this one at all costs.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Random turn-based combat and impenetrable inventory. [Spring 2011 p.116]
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameOver.gr,40,It seems that after a continuous flow of releases Supermassive Games has run out of juice. Bravo Team is more or less a broken game an idea that really does not work on any degree and probably the worst 1st party game for the PSVR to date.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,God is a Geek,40,Rodea The Sky Soldier on 3DS has very few good things going for it overshadowed by atrocious controls and bland visuals. It is designed to be replayed but I don’t ever want to experience it again.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,GameSpy,40,The slow load times the tedious puzzles and the overall lack of fun in this title are almost awe inspiring. Its really very hard figure out why someone gave the go-ahead on its production.
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,Extreme Gamer,40,A flat out bomb just like the pictures ticket sales. Its a shame Electronic Arts had to develop a movie version of Catwoman without the freedom of using the real feline character from the comics. Stay away from this game.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN,40,Sloppily produced and bug-filled. Its still playable but its extremely difficult to overlook all the games problems...because theres just so many of them.

Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,AtomicGamer,51,Whether you pick this one up for the PC or for Xbox Live Arcade you can be assured that youre getting a mediocre game thats only loosely tied to the events of the show.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,games(TM),40,Somewhere buried within The Sky Soldier is the kernel of an idea that defies gravity as well as our expectations. Sadly despite Naka’s best intentions Rodea never hits those heights.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),40,Dumb fun boils over into awful stew when we as the Greek Achilles are forced to stab toes during a two-part and cliche-addled boss fight against a giant statue complete with respawning zombie minions quick-time events and enough hamartia to choke mighty Zeus himself. [June 2011 p.75]
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Computer and Video Games,40,The faster the car the more jelly-like things seem to become. The gorgeous Ford GT 2005 handles like the entire world was one big bouncy castle as it bobs and lurches around like it had helium-filled wheels. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Xbox Achievements,42,Darkest of Days takes the concept of time travel in an interesting direction and then proceeds to fumble at every turn. Poor AI and slowdown lead the list of this games problems and with so many better shooters out there this isnt worth the time and frustration.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,3DJuegos,40,The Scourge Project it´s just an unpolished third person shooter utilizing the Unreal Engine and featuring four Gears of War wannabes as its main characters. Uninspired gameplay constant issues and boring story this game is one to avoid.
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Absolute Games,35,Sword of the Stars 2 is what happens when a space opera becomes a hostage of amateurish idealists.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,40,Theres very little to redeem a generally poor effort to create a tycoon game for the DS that has any personality or creates any real fun for the player.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Absolute Games,35,It’s hard to see why they ask money for this one. If you want to swing a baseball bat as Rorschach save yourself $15 and just buy Part I.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,3DJuegos,40,A disappointing experience. Confounds the simple things with the annoying mechanics. Far away from the great games of the turtles and the excellence of the Japanese developers. Platinum Games are human too.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,40,Nothing more than a stagnant relentlessly boring game. You can exploit everything the game has to offer in less than a couple of hours.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamePro,40,No matter how many bonuses are unlocked or how many special guests show up the core gameplay of Superman: The Man of Steel is boring.
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,PSX Nation,40,Once you go it alone it becomes increasingly clear that your teammate AI is straight out pathetic.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Everyeye.it,45,No difference between part 2 and part 1: boring dull and short.
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,IGN,40,Hardcore Hummer fans or owners will like seeing taking control of their favorite rides. Racing fans however will not enjoy the weak competition shallow game modes and lackluster graphics and sound.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,DarkStation,40,The gameplay just seemed so bland and boring that I really dont think I ever enjoyed this game.
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,DarkZero,40,It’s quite hard to recommend Last Rebellion to anyone but some insane hardcore RPG person certainly after the recent rush of decent titles that have arrived for the genre. The game is full of so many decisions that hamper the experience and fun.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,40,Its not just the ball that will be rolling when youre playing Chronovolt your eyes will be clocking in overtime too. It might be free if youre subscribed to PlayStation Plus but you wont be doing yourself any favours by downloading it. Its boring. Its got a ton of bugs. It sucks balls. [January 2013 p.94]
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameCritics,40,I still count myself as a huge fan of Dead Island but Ryder White takes too many wrong turns and strays from what made the original game what it was. Completists will surely want to see the twist ending but more casual fans of the game dont have much reason to take this brutal frustrating trip.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Core Magazine,42,Its always interesting to have the option of being the bad guy but truly bland gameplay and a relatively short quest sap the fun and make this a rental at best.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpy,40,Even at $29.99 and with an arcade mode that might keep you amused for five or ten minutes State of Emergency 2 feels simultaneously stale and awkward. It isnt complete trash but it is too aggravating and unimaginative to be worth more than a Friday night rental.
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,40,AeternoBlade II for the Nintendo Switch has some good ideas and its RPG-like elements do give the game some appeal. That said the execution is rather poor and its combat quickly becomes frustrating. Adding to that its mediocre art style technical issues and exceedingly long loading times make this a rather botched experience that becomes difficult to recommend.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,The Indie Game Website,40,The story itself is told through comic book panels that do inject a bit of colour and personality into the game but it’s not enough. This is soulless empty and unpolished – a total whiteout. In old Norse ‘fimbul’ translates as mighty or great. But this particular Fimbul is anything but.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,VideoGamer,40,Golden Axe is the latest classic franchise to disappoint on new hardware and we cant help but think its a huge wasted opportunity. Beast Rider even fails to include multiplayer support something that was core to the original game confirming its fate as a sub-par hack n slash.
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Cheat Code Central,38,Although there are plenty of modes the poor controls hamper any play value this title might have had.
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,Too many games that involve no skill. [Aug 2007 p.98]
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,The Overpowered Noobs,40,With Sonic and Mario in the spotlight again Bubsy takes another swipe at being a lovable mascot but doesn’t succeed in capturing the same sentiment. Ultimately Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back (Bubsy) the platforming game arrives as the two-decades-too-late 5th entry in the series. Despite excellent controls the title does not overcome some of its more pressing shortcomings such as level design resulting in a sub-par gaming experience.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamer.nl,40,Offers little variation and hardly requires strategic input which leaves a mindless third-person shooter. The well-executed story and great looking characters make it a tad more interesting but these elements cant hide the fact that the four-eyed magician often turns to his wands for simple and selfish needs.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,IGN,40,You should probably avoid Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey even if youre obsessed with pirates -- its just not a well-made game.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,GamesRadar+,40,An interesting blast from the past but much like the visuals of the original film it really doesn’t hold up over time.
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,1UP,40,As a budget release Renegade Paintball is a bit more robust than you would imagine but the buggy gameplay along with several more oddities will be quick to remind you that yes this is yet another half-baked budgetware title to forget about.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Edge Magazine,40,For all its wit and swagger Truckers is inescapably safety-conscious rewarding the maintenance of a planned route and steady trajectory while more arresting notions - spontaneous risk for example - fall from the back like poorly fastened cases of moonshine. [Sept 2005 p.99]
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GameSpot,40,Warriors Orochi 2 elevates hack-and-slash action to amazing levels of repetitive boredom.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,Play.tm,40,A cheap shoddy cash in.
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,G4 TV,40,Only those gamers in it for the puzzles will get a kick out of this one--those who don’t get overwhelmed that is.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GameOver.gr,40,Rise of the Dark Spark is the definition of a movie tie-in. It contains all the ingredients of uninspired levels nonsensical story and dull repetitive gameplay.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,40,The Tetris we all know and love never got boring. This does. [June 2002 p.100]
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,Happy Puppy,45,More of a rental than a purchase unless youre a huge football fanatic who requires every pigskin video game.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,PSNStores,40,It sucks to say it but the frustrating controls flat out ruin any enjoyment I had with Q*Bert Rebooted. The path that you take throughout each stage is so important to Q*Bert and having controls that don’t cooperate in that respect really sucks.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,A large open world and plenty of options cant make up for trainwreck technology bad writing and clumsy combat. [Oct 2014 p.93]
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Boomtown,40,The breaking of the missions into arbitrary short sections doesnt work for me as I would prefer to see a large mission with sub-goals rather than what feels like lots of really short missions.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,IGN,40,While there is some fun to be had at the most simplistic of levels no effort was put into making this a stand-alone great DS title.
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Multiplayer.it,40,Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D looks like a rushed product which does not even tale advantage of features such as the touch screen. The idea of a war between dinosaurs is neat but the developer had to work harder on the overall gameplay.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,Hardcore Gamer,40,Despite its ambitious stride to tell a gripping tale of a father/husband striving desperately to look for his missing family Husk‘s end delivery is anything but. With a host of mechanical and structural oddities breaking numerous points of immersion where it’s seldom gained — both before and after post-release updates — across environments that though blended rather well into one another could very well be found in ample other titles using horror as an attribute Husk is a frustrating game to recommend. Marred by technical difficulties that come to question just how finished this game truly is/was Husk is another example of a studio that have mistaken basic nostalgia for the wealth of enjoyment.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),50,Paradises bag of tricks is sadly limited leaving only a violent juvenile romp were reluctant to recommend. [Holiday 2012 p.73]
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,Nintendo Life,40,Its entirely possible that one day UFO Interactive will crack the code of a genuinely interesting game but with a sense of humor about as basic as its mechanics - which is to say incredibly so - Johnny Kung Fu still has a ways to go.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,IGN,45,This isn’t the game mah jong players were waiting for on XBLA but it works as advertised and will tide people over until something better comes along. The lack of avatar support is disappointing as is the poor presentation and sub-par tutorial. But the online works and that’s all many players will require.
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,With the hilarity of multiplayer locked until you finish the solo missions and a slightly too-high price this is one to miss. Shame. [July 2008 p.94]
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,Gamestyle,40,We long for a good Godzilla game but this isn’t it.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamesRadar+,40,Destined to line bargain bin bottoms. It has its hacking and slashing moments but like so many movie-licensed titles it reeks of a truncated production schedule and a too-heavy reliance on a story intended for another medium.
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,Game Chronicles,35,Boring difficult (due to poor design) and repetitive.
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,IGN,30,I didnt like this game a bit. Its badly designed weak on tricks obvious slow and light years behind the best or even the most average extreme sports games.
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,GamesRadar+,40,It’s a sound idea that’s torpedoed by poor design and bad play mechanics.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,Laziness of the worst kind this is a charmless shadow of the next-gen version. There are plenty of better shooters available on PS2. [May 2006 p.82]
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,COGconnected,35,The big problem with Music VR is that the game just doesn’t have a lot of substance.
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gamers' Temple,41,There are just far too many better options out there when it comes to strategy games so why bother with a poorly designed one that is in the end an exercise in frustration?
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,NintendoWorldReport,40,There’s no reason to spend your pennies on CORE when several other far superior DS first-person shooters are sitting right next to it like Call of Duty 4 and Moon.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,Eurogamer,40,Later levels tend to get merely more irritating rather than more enjoyable and the many fans of the Oddworld series would have been better served with handheld versions of Abes Oddysee and Abes Exoddus rather than this frankly overpriced lame effort.
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,IGN,38,Too bad as is one of those lazy dragons needs to turn its fat ass around and blow some fire directly at the game from which it came as a little smoldering action is the only salvation I can fathom for this beast. Steer clear far clear.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PTGamers,40,In case you’re not interested in Tony Stark’s adventures there are much better games.
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,Computer and Video Games,43,The special attacks look crap and make no sense. How can you possibly electrocute a skeleton? Dry bone doesnt conduct. Someone wins. Youre bored. The end.
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Yahoo!,40,And even if the training mode was more fun and well thought out it still all boils down to how good the main game is...and frankly the main game isnt very good anyway.
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Happy Puppy,40,The biggest problem area in Mike Tyson Boxing is the controls. Theyre not completely unresponsive but there is a definite delay that affects the overall gameplay and fluidity of the game.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,IGN,35,TotemBall also isnt nearly as intuitive as the PlayStation 2s EyeToy which tracks and translates movement far more accurately and quickly. Nor is the input smartly implemented.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Fork out 40 quid for Hellboy? Hell no! [Sept 2008 p.90]
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,FNintendo,30,Vaccine starts off from an interesting idea and the similarities to the original Resident Evil may raise expectations but unfortunately its concept was not rightly put into place and the result is a game that is built on whats negative - the controls its very outdated graphics and complete lack of variety - and barely touches whats positive as its idea gets easily sidelined by its more negative aspects.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,GameSpy,40,In a way Cortex Command seems like its asking for a lot of concessions because for the most part it still feels like an unfinished game.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameZone,45,Sadly this is a game that certainly does have the potential of being a worthwhile paintball title but falls short in so many ways that even shooter fans will be greatly disappointed.
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,41,This is every bit the under-developed movie tie-in. [Aug 2008 p.63]
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,G4 TV,40,A good-looking but brain-dead thumb-numbing game.

Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,Eurogamer Portugal,40,This is another game on the long list of uninspired games based on film licenses.
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Worth Playing,45,When I first started playing Sun Age I felt a pang of nostalgia for the way games used to be but it was quickly replaced by the feeling that this would have been a broken title even back then.
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,GameCritics,30,Submersed is a tragic mess of mistakes and in addition to everything above it’s buggy. I had several crashes textures sometimes disappear from walls if one gets too close and I’ve fallen through solid floors. If it wasn’t already obvious that one solid setpiece can’t prop up a mediocre game Submersed should be all the proof that’s required.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Linear and boring shooter with unpleasant lack of checkpoints low IQ enemies and ill-managed main feature – mind capturing. [Issue#201]
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Game Rant,40,Anyone desperate to play this type of game on console will be pleased with the results. Beyond that it’s difficult to wholeheartedly recommend Infinity Runner — but it’s certainly not without its merits.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,GamesRadar+,40,In the end it’s a cool experiment but it quickly goes horribly wrong.
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Game Informer,40,This level of sub-mediocre FPS boredom isnt even close to worth its $20 price point. [June 2005 p.126]
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,40,What youre really fighting in this game is the rules - and boredom. Its boredom that drives me to consume fried delectables and I can tell you I must have gained eight pounds playing Empire of Magic.
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Game Revolution,42,A games strength is not found in its replays nor its deck editing. Its found in its gameplay which is precisely where Evolution Skateboarding falters.
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,Computer Gaming World,40,The grand total of six events feels rather skimpy and theyre very uneven in how well they play. [May 2002 p.90]
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,35,There’s a cynicism deep-rooted in Calvino Noir a heavy darkness you can’t escape. Death is always lurking success is futile. Maybe this is the best representation of noire in games that nobody wanted.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,Gamer.nl,40,At first the game will get your sympathy. It looks nice with its 3D surroundings and cute looking cartoon characters but it wont take long before the very very bad game concept destroys everything that you might like. Tornado offers little less than looking around for objects and remembering were they are when you need them a second time. On top of that you hardly see anything of the surroundings resulting in a well earned insufficient grade.
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,Computer Games Online RO,30,Because no matter how much they fix it Forsaken Gods is a very poor title. I didn’t like it I don’t recommend it and I am saying that not without regrets because we’re still talking about a Gothic game.
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Game Rant,40,MilitAnt‘s poorly implemented targeting system combined with its weak visual presentation and mediocre platforming squander its interesting premise.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Gameplanet,40,Its a nice attempt but ultimately falls short of the entertainment wed expect from such a title. In a market saturated with similarly designed games this one does little to stand out.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,IGN,40,The collision detection in the combat engine is a bit wonky since some punches connect but others dont...and its not exactly fun to miss stabbing someone in the chest by only a pixel or two when theyre down on the ground.
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,G4 TV,40,The same players who found relentless party-balancing corridor fighting ultimately frustrating in a cute cartoony game like Evolution Worlds wont find it any more refreshing here just because its wearing a darker spookier Aliens costume.
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,Yahoo!,40,The most frustrating aspect of the game is the annoyance of not being able to save it until the end of each level.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Wccftech,38,Bombshell sadly shows its origins age and bad design choices. It feels dated on release has too little variety and requires too much back tracking though this doesnt mean that you cant have some fun with the action combined with a great selection of hard rock music.
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,GameOver.gr,40,The development hell problems are quite obvious in Enemy Front. The use of CryEngine and the beloved WWII theme cannot save the mess this game is.
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,40,An abysmal failure. No sense of excitement fear or anything. [July 2009 p.76]
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Play.tm,35,Its ugly its poorly executed its riddled with technical glitches its A.I. is laughable its boring unoriginal and thoroughly unrewarding.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Level7.nu,40,Star Trek is a game with a lot of potential. None of which is being used. The game design is old incomplete and riddled with bugs. The actors make a decent job and the co-op mode is alright but that is the only good things worth mentioning about this otherwise bland and forgettable tie-in to the movie.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpot,39,The main asset to the license -- a degree of smart sexiness akin to old 70s James Bond movie posters -- has become crass and obvious in its translation to 3D.
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,Worth Playing,38,Maybe there is a very small demographic of people who love Egyptian-themed music and are obsessive-compulsive enough to only want to play one type of puzzle endlessly. If so then Word Puzzle was made for them. Otherwise save your points save your time and save yourself the headache.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Atomix,40,If theres a game that fits perfectly as a kusoge (the term that Japanese gamers use for terrible games) Devils Third is definitely one of a kind. Itagakis experiment is a total failure in all of games aspects: bad gameplay mechanics terrible narrative and poor graphics make this title something to avoid.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,AusGamers,35,Floaty imprecise controls a lack of depth random spikes in difficulty due to bad design random frustration a mini-game for the sake of a mini-game and a protagonist with the all the charisma of a shiny blue block.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,GameCritics,30,Blood Knights is representative of the terrible trend in game design where its devs have taken what might have been a mediocre-but-serviceable brawler and packed it full of systems that do nothing for the player but push them further away from the action.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,GamesRadar+,40,Fans of the series might find it entertaining to rescue kidnapped kids while battling the Seven Demon Kings but most people will find precious little to enjoy.
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,Gaming Age,42,What is the purpose of completing the tasks other than unlocking some mini games? I have no idea but the tasks are usually not that bad. In fact some of them are even fun. They must have had some creative writers on staff to come up with the tasks.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Really the biggest problem with Monster Jam is its price--for $20 wed be all over it but $50? Get over your bad self. [Mar 2008 p.92]
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer,40,Sanctum of Slime couldve been partially redeemed with co-op but since its ridiculously limited to local-only(no online or even LAN) few will ever bother to play it on PC. [Aug 2011 p.76]
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,COGconnected,30,The lack of diversity and challenge is boring and the level design doesn’t do anything to help the gameplay.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Eurogamer Portugal,40,The greatest failure of Quantum Theory begins perhaps with the initial target of copying Gears of War as a model to reach new audiences.
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GamesRadar+,30,We might be able to forgive the game its sin of unoriginality and consumer whoring but we can’t forgive them for taking the fun out of shaving a sheep. Tacked-on twitchy controls; lousy graphics and all-round dull gameplay fraught with mindless minigames tank any hope a would-be virtual farmer might have of actually having fun on a farm.
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,IGN,40,New Rally-X is probably fun for the pure nostalgia of it. For new gamers who like old retro games its also a nice way to get acquainted with one really old game that doesnt quite translate to the 21st century.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PC Games,40,Even hardcore fans of Harry Potter have to admit: This adventure is not only boring and without highlights its also designed without any love for videogames or the Potter franchise.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,FNintendo,40,If at its core the game itself remains good - it is after all the same as FIFA 19 - the product being sold under this name is simply not what EA should be presenting to its consumers. While updated squads and jerseys fit perfectly with the idea of a regular update to a football simulation charging a full games price for nothing but an update is simply unacceptable.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,The Sydney Morning Herald,40,Unfortunately the network code controlling everything is poor. Players and vehicles warp all over the place making it next to impossible to hit anything.
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Worth Playing,40,While you have to give credit to Spuds Unearthed for trying to be bold and merging two genres into the VR perspective the execution does not work well. The dodgy controls make a poor impression on those trying out VR for the first time and the lack of a narrative makes it all feel pointless. The lack of proper explanation for anything is what dooms the game as it takes loads of unnecessary trial and error to figure things out from initiating multiplayer to how to set up for fights let alone how to make yourself useful in the skirmishes. While Spuds Unearthed isnt the worst VR experience out there it is certainly one to avoid.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,games(TM),40,It is without a point. It fires its Uzi rounds aimlessly and manages to hit nothing. It’s not bad it’s not horrific it’s not reprehensible and it’s not memorable either.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Play.tm,38,Apart from the topical title Flushed Away shares the same type of brain busting boredom weve all come to expect from these sort of lazy cash-ins with the added disadvantage of leaving itself open for some puntastic criticism... absolute toilet.
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,GameGrin,40,New Gundam Breaker is a good concept shoddily put together. The story is a trope-fest battles are confusing and the masses of text are hard to read. There are so few positive points it’s not funny.
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,PSM3 Magazine UK,43,Unfortunately the games biggest strength is also its downfall. It stays true to the pace and mechanics of the real game. [Nov 2008 p.84]
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Not even nicely suited apes are able to save this repetitive visually obsolete and boring game. You better get drunk before trying this ape hunt. [Issue#207]
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,40,The game becomes the chore it aims to send up. [Nov 2011 p.75]
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Play Magazine,40,Exasperating mini-games; bad AI camera jams and a slap in the face story to any fan...This is not good...no--this is really not good. [Apr 2006 p.63]
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IGN,34,The laughable A.I. boring level design pedestrian graphics and tattered story make this a game that should be avoided by young and old alike.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Vandal,45,Blades doesn’t live up to the expectations players have for this franchise. It has some interesting features but its gameplay and an old-fashioned free-to-play design make it very forgettable.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Level7.nu,40,Filled to the brim with minigames and old classics but sadly most of them just arent very fun.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Game Informer,35,Those patient enough to suffer through the initial gameplay inadequacies are rewarded with horrible low-quality cutscenes a special Accelerator Suit ability that often drains during said cutscenes unreachable power-ups that hover just out of grasp the worst vehicle controls I’ve used in years and voice overacting that makes the guy who says killing spree in Unreal Tournament sound understated.
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,GameDaily,40,Wrought with visual glitches and pre-existing issues with poor camera angles the mixture of zippy running missions grows tedious at near-Sonic speed with limited control and boring exploration sequences. This one hits a brick wall for sure.
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,XGN,40,Super Dungeon Bros has little to no originality. It is repetitive and there is almost no variation. The weapons are not effective but on the bright side the game is a bit more fun in multiplayer. Still the game is just not worth buying.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,Worth Playing,40,Unfortunately Omerta: City of Gangsters isnt worth playing. The concept is solid as is the decision to split the game into two distinct game types but the execution of both game types is subpar.
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,Nintendophiles,40,This game was just a little too slow (though faster than most) pulled cheap tricks and was lacking in most departments (no stats no Homerun Derby no All-Star Game) and too frustrating.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,IGN,38,Id recommend Anarchy Rulz only to ECW fans and their reaction might only be to wonder where everything they liked about the promotion has gone.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameDaily,40,We just wish the designers paid more attention to the controls and did something dramatic with the gameplay. Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes is a below average adventure thats difficult to recommend even as a rental. We suggest Force pushing it into a galaxy far far away.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,Hardcore Gamer,40,They wanted to give the IP as much space as possible from this train wreck and I’d suggest you give yourself the same.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,44,America’s Army: True Soldiers is essentially a poor man’s version of Ghost Recon or Vegas but you can’t tell from the asking price.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamer.nl,40,Offers little variation and hardly requires strategic input which leaves a mindless third-person shooter. The well-executed story and great looking characters make it a tad more interesting but these elements cant hide the fact that the four-eyed magician often turns to his wands for simple and selfish needs.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,40,Since the story has to be read through terrible talking heads it would be far more enjoyable to just pick up the book. Then the reader can use their imagination to picture characters that dont look deformed environments that arent even blander than real life and action that isnt repetitive and unfulfilling.
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Gamer 2.0,37,On the DS it is a bland and nearly unplayable game that youll probably hate so much that you’d forget what love was.
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,GameSpew,40,In its current state Dead or Alive: Xtreme 3 is a nice game to relax and unwind with but beyond that it’s a very disappointing and lazy entry into the Xtreme series.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,PlayStation LifeStyle,35,Unfortunately if you are stone cold sober and trying to channel your inner Doogie Howser this lack of any tangible precision will prove to be an instant turn-off.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Game Fan,50,This is easily one of the worst racers for the Nintendo 64.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Xbox Nation Magazine,40,There are audio glitches galore with sound effects either missing or repeating themselves over and over for no good reason. [Feb 2005 p.93]
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,MondoXbox,40,Even if based on a very interesting idea Dead Alliance pitifully falls due to too many technical problems that make it practically unplayable.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,Cheat Code Central,40,Suffers from technical problems which will only serve to frustrate meticulous RTS fans.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer Sweden,40,It has been delayed for more than a decade and yet it still has parts that look that old and still not finished. A basically broken Aliens game is to some degree saved by Gearboxs unquestionable love for the franchise and the ability to play the campaign split-screen.
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,The Digital Fix,30,Sadly lacking in depth so much so in fact that you can literally play most of it with your eyes closed.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameDaily,40,We just wish the designers paid more attention to the controls and did something dramatic with the gameplay. Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes is a below average adventure thats difficult to recommend even as a rental. We suggest Force pushing it into a galaxy far far away.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,GamesRadar+,30,We suspect that control scheme would work better if it emulated that found in games like Robotron 2084 or Geometry Wars - though that wouldnt be as authentic it could make Tron a fantastic Live Arcade game. But as it is this just doesnt work.
Farscape: The Game,PC,Aug-8-2002,Red Lemon Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Adrenaline Vault,40,Misfires on pretty much all cylinders.
Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Gaming Nexus,40,The long tradition of execrable license tie-ins continues with Justice League Heroes for DS...Even a hardcore Justice League fan will be hard pressed to enjoy this one.
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,NintendoWorldReport,35,Gardening Mama 2 is worthless.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Nintendo Life,40,Ben 10: Omniverse falls into a lot of the same traps that lesser games in this genre do — lots of repetitive button-mashing gameplay uninspired level design and clunky controls.
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,IGN,35,Although the gameplay isnt quite broken since its still physically possible to participate in races it just isnt fun.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Cheat Code Central,40,The latest game is entitled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee and like the last two games threatens to send the Turtles back into hibernation or wherever the hell they went last time.
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PSX Extreme,38,Naughty Bear is just another game that features a great concept but fails miserably in execution which is why you really shouldnt bother paying full pop for this one.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,IGN,35,If Bliss Island were a website of free flash games it would be worthwhile as a distraction. Paying for it is not a good idea.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,IGN,40,Knock off the crap and get to work on something worth playing already!
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,CalmDownTom,40,Rise of the Dark Spark is a decent enough title but its failing is that it changes too much. It’s nothing more than a shallow poorly executed imitation of Fall of Cybertron.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,40,While the runner platformer is fine and the visuals and story behind the game pleasant the end result does not come together to create a cohesive experience worth investing your time into.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,GameSpew,40,It won’t cause as many laughs as it did in Early Access but also won’t give you as many thrills as the originals. Roller Coaster Tycoon World is a fumbled hodgepodge of ideas that are emotionally detached from what makes a Tycoon game great.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Eurogamer Sweden,40,Air Conflicts Vietnam tries to be easy to pick up but merely manages to be easy to put down. The theme of the Vietnam conflict is portrayed well but besides that the experience left me wanting. Lack of AI and some bugged out missions pull the game down from being just mediocre.
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Edge Magazine,40,Its almost a relief that the game struggling to break free from these severe technical shortcomings is mundane. [May 2011 p.104]
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,XGN,25,Because of the lack of depth and a boring gameplay you will only play this title one or at most two times. After that it will rust in the Wii. So its a waste of money to buy this game.
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Theres simply nothing here to justify you buying it ahead of 2Ks b-ball champ. [Jan 2014 p.84]
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Cheat Code Central,44,Hardcore Dynasty Warriors fans will probably get this title for the storyline alone. More casual fans of the series stay away!
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN,40,An extremely sloppy production thats not fun to play and even if you love the series this game might end up turning you off of the franchise.
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Metro GameCentral,30,It looks like Ice Age 4 it sounds like Ice Age 4 and it plays like the frozen carcass of a 5000 year old mammoth.
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Joystiq,40,Wait ... this is a retail game? And you have to pay $50 for it? Unfortunately in spite of a few good ideas Naughty Bear is too sloppily executed and too shallow to recommend -- especially as a full retail experience.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,An exasperating experience. [Issue#106 p.85]
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,35,The original Nintendo DS game was a terrible collection of mini-games and the Wii version continues that tradition.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,35,Easy short linear and with embarrasing flaws in AI this game is a huge disappointment.
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer.tv,40,Rengokus clunky control system does well to convince you youre a steel-clad cyborg but unfortunately this rigid feel doesnt lend itself to an enjoyable game. [JPN Import]
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,We Got This Covered,40,WWE 2K20 has its issues and maybe they could have been overlooked if all the game modes worked. Sadly that is not the case and it feels like a broken game from the get-go.
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,GameOver.gr,40,Feelplus and Square-Enixʼs new try in the shooting genre falls way too short compared even to the weakest 3rd-person shooters of the last five years.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,GamesVillage.it,40,ENKI appears as an amateur project something that a group of friends can develop during weekends. Unfortunately it’s a commercial product and it must be treated as such. It’s plagued by lots of design and technical issues and it’s simply not fun.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Gaming Maxx,39,Of course misery loves company. So call up someone you hate and invite them over for hours of terminal and ponderous gaming. Whee!
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,IGN,40,I cant really recommend this game to anyone in good faith even fans jonesing for any motocross game. Stay away.
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Joystiq,40,Venetica contains hints of a compelling quest but feels like its development life was cut short. The end result is a potentially grand concept that just cant flourish within its forced generic confines.
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,RPGamer,40,The potential is still there because Romance Dawn doesnt do nearly enough right to make this an adequate substitute for reading the manga or watching the anime.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Computer Games Magazine,30,Despite the lack of satire and occasional lack of sense the game is mostly playable. However the interface and the odd bugs make it a chore. [July 2006 p.65]
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,PSM3 Magazine UK,36,Overall Flying is sometimes a joy but Iron Man is basically repetitive confusing and graceless.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Game Over Online,40,Outside of climbing up the leaderboards or finding every hidden item theres little reason to return to the game once youve played through it once.
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Is there a single person at SEGA or at the Creative Assembly who thinks they made a really good game? A game someone would want to buy? It’s about time to consider some sacking in both companies. [Apr 2009]
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,InsideGamer.nl,35,Theres a lot wrong with Star Trek. The story is told very averagely environments are boring shooting is unsatisfactory your companion will annoy you to death and boring puzzles might just eradicate most of your brain cells. The only fun I had with this game is thanks to the hilarious bugs.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,TheSixthAxis,30,I’m trying my best to think of some kind of clever joke or metaphor about Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle but I don’t even think the game deserves that kind of effort on my part. Burst Battle is an awful video game. Without a tutorial learning to play is no fun at all and I had an equal sum of zero fun playing it when I actually knew how to play. If you’re itching for a Touhou fighting game run to your PC and download one of the official 2D fighting games from the main series. Never touch Burst Battle. Learn from my errors and live a long healthy fulfilling life.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpy,30,Since the controls are so clunky youll be wobbling to align properly with the criminal in question; so while hes nailing you with bullets your sole concern is landing one shot.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Game Over Online,40,Really I’ve reviewed some bad games in my time but Dino Island is the first that was completely and seemingly intentionally bad.
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,GameSpot,44,This traditional adventure game offers a few attractive scenes but otherwise its an exercise in tedium that will disappoint even avid adventure gamers.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,GameZone,40,Thanks to its broken controls awkward combat mechanics and uninspiring mission objectives it’s hard to recommend this game to dedicated fans of the show.
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,IGN,35,The fighting system itself is has a few interesting features but almost everything else about the game will either frustrate or annoy. The camera the enemy A.I. almost every aspect of the graphics the sound effects and the required mini-games are all decidedly sub-par
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Console Monster,36,Disappointing.
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,Gameblog.fr,30,Its sure that developers of Fear Effect Sedna are huge fans of the franchise. They had some ideas about this new episode and there are a few elements that feel compelling. But in the end there are too many things that just dont work or frustrate the players. Too bad.
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Games Master UK,40,Wont give Mr. Tajitnov sleepless nights. [Aug 2012 p.80]
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,RPG Fan,38,Time & Eternity is by far one of the worst RPGs I have ever played and even when accounting for different tastes I cannot recommend it to anyone. At best a select few may enjoy the games sense of humor but Im convinced that the gameplay is so broken that almost anyone will regret purchasing this game.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,GameSpot,29,MC Groovz may feature The Fresh Princes Parents Just Dont Understand but dancing to its poorly stepped overly lengthy tracks just makes us feel like Carlton Banks.
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,40,Bloodforge is gorgeous and has high production values but in the end it lacks depth and the story is so lame its outright impossible to care about anything that happens on screen.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,1UP,40,Other than the exclusive ArchLord gimmick were left with a dated-looking game with limited classes and a lot of grind and a miniscule chance of something cool at the end if you really throw yourself into it. Not exactly our cup of mead.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Nintendojo,42,There’s an earnestness to Rogue Corps that makes it even sadder to see the game fail as it has. There have been updates since the game launched but nothing thus far has been able to elevate Rogue Corps to the standard of quality set by past series installments. If Konami wants to modernize its franchises for future generations the message should be clear: fans want what made those classics so endearing to begin with not misguided radical redesigns.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,IGN Spain,40,Just a plain bad kart game that manages to copy the best game on its genre but fails on doing it.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,Gamervision,40,The best thing I can say about Coraline is that it’s not broken. It works and just about anyone could play it from start to finish but I don’t understand why anyone would want to.
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,Gamers' Temple,39,The graphics are about on par with everything else in the game. The resolution is locked at 800x600 and even if you ignore the blockiness of the graphics the small levels are bland and uninteresting and the cutscenes smack of stock-footage amateurism.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,The Escapist,40,As it is the repetitive missions and poor pacing are ultimately too distracting for the games few virtues to shine through.
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,My Gamer,36,From the glitchy programming the poor graphical quality a camera that never listens to the player and horrific level design Brave: A Warrior’s Tale is an incomplete product.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,Suffers from being in a big sea of similar titles. [Jan 2011]
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PSM3 Magazine UK,37,Dumb AI stupidly linear crap guns... a disaster. [May 2008 p.79]
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Worth Playing,30,Family Party doesnt bring anything new to the table. It may be a budget-priced title at $20 but I would venture to say that is almost too much to pay for this one.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Nintendo Power,30,Only through sheer force of will have I avoided comparing the enjoyment derived from playing SPRay to that of regurgitating a lung. [Dec 2008 p.93]
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,Riot Pixels,35,This game is equally bad in all of its aspects. The developers should remove all the gameplay and turn Kursk into a free virtual tour of the submarine.
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,XboxAddict,40,There was a lot of hype behind Hello Neighbor and Ive even started seeing merch at stores to purchase but at this point in time it hasn’t lived up to it yet not even close. The ideas are there as is the premise and backdrop but the execution is severely lacking in the worst possible way. Sure some fixes might make it a better experience but there’s no way this should be a full release in its current state. With all this in mind I say Goodbye Neighbor.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,VGPub,40,If you’re really into battleship warfare or looking for something to get your grandfather who’s a World War Two navy vet that needs something else to play on his DS besides Brain Age you’ll like this game. Everyone else should go play Advance Wars: DS or one of its earlier titles.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Play (Poland),40,A role playing game that poses as a strategy by using just the numbers. This means that your adventuring party can have as many as twenty or thirty members and you have to take care of every soldiers needs and wants from armor to magic crystals to retirement plans. The games ugly looks combined with the unintelligible interface and bad AI make the whole thing marginally playable in the best moments and huge pain in the posterior in the worst. [Apr 2008]
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GameSpot,35,If Rock Revolution came out two or three years ago it might have been revolutionary but in 2008 its not even relevant. Uninspired presentation a tiny tracklist that includes no master tracks a complete lack of vocal support uninteresting gameplay and a barebones Career mode are just a few of the many ways in with Rock Revolution fails.
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,SpazioGames,40,A bad remaster of a mediocre game. Why someone decided to put money into developing this we don’t and cannot know. If you want to get dirty just jump in a puddle even the mud is not that great in this game.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,43,Not the best but Fatal Conspiracy is better than its individual parts would have you believe. [Jan 2011 p.82]
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,IGN,30,Go! Sports Skydiving is slightly better than Go! Sports Ski. Nuff said.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,NZGamer,40,As the plodding narrative progresses these repetitive fighting and stealth tasks grow quickly tedious.
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,GameSpot,35,Has virtually no lasting value whatsoever and just isnt much fun to play even as long as it lasts.
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Gaming Age,33,The AI basically flip flops around from being faster than any other racer out there to racers who lack that gray matter up in the head called brain.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpot,31,The environments are no fun to get through fights are infrequent and the simplistic combat is unfulfilling.
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,40,At the beginning of the game there is a gut wrenching choice to be made of whether you want to be a mage a hunter or a fighter. We have played racing games with more original RPG-elements than this utterly dull game. [June 2013 p.86]
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Play UK,33,Theres just no depth to Xaolin Showdown whatsoever. [Issue #150 p.89]
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,TheXboxHub,30,I understand that delays post-launch patches and day one updates are now par for the gaming course but that doesn’t mean that a game shouldn’t be held back if it’s not up to scratch. Case in point: Tennis World Tour.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,GameFocus,41,Bad jumping mechanics.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,ActionTrip,42,This game can be completed from start to finish in two hours. I am not joking. Whats more is theres no incentive to go back and replay anything in this game. All in all the PC version of this magnificent film with an equally magnificent console game does not measure up to either side of its namesake.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,40,In short Shattered Universe just doesnt deliver. The onscreen action never heats up enough to be considered exciting and even if it did the shoddy control scheme would keep it from being any fun anyway. [Dec 2003 p.176]
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,40,Sega struggled to deliver a compelling superhero experience with the first Iron Man game but even now armed with a new developer and second playable hero the sequel falls similarly flat. [July 2010 p.88]
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,36,A stab at a cold Summer Athletics anchored down by too many weak events. [Apr 2009 p.89]
Deca Sports 3,Wii,Oct-26-2010,Hudson | NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Sports | General | General,Nintendo Life,30,Greater options for customisation would have helped a bit as would options for differing control styles but ultimately Deca Sports 3 is flawed enough at its core that no amount of additional features would help it much. Sorry sports fans.
Rugby 18,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Koch Media,Sports | Team | Rugby,The Games Machine,40,Terrifying is the right word to tell something about Rugby 18. The game is very far from what actually happens on the pitch and its not fun at all.
Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Worth Playing,40,The content isnt even worth a laugh and the story is so full of holes (is this based on a Croatian comic or show? It seems to expect you to know the cast in advance) and clichés that it has no value unless youre a die-hard fan of Eastern European culture.
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,IGN,40,Whatever redeeming aspects it may have had are marred by a plethora of inconveniences and annoyances that round out boring repetitive play.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,GameDaily,40,Iron Man 2 suffers from the same lack of energy as the first game and despite a few interesting ideas comes up short. Save your cash and go see the movie instead.
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,Eurogamer Italy,40,The ghost of Wayward Manor surely has lots of limitations and ends up being haunted by all the wasted potential of the game.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GameFocus,40,It still has some elements that make it slightly enjoyable but with the wealth of other experiences on XBLA its really hard to justify investing your hard earned Microsoft Points in a second hand toy.
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Sadly Cyberball 2072 doesnt live up to our feelings of nostalgia and a couple of design choices by the dev team leave this port on the wrong side of the line of scrimmage. [Dec 2007 p.78]
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,NintendoWorldReport,40,Cybertron Adventures has way too many problems to be worth your time. The lackluster and unstable gameplay make the whole experience unfufilling.
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,The A.V. Club,33,You have to struggle with touchy controls and flaws in the game logic. For example if you hang onto a human shield for too long the cops will just shoot your hostage to get him out of the way. How is that fair to anybody?
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,Worth Playing,30,Even if you found yourself enjoying Gothic 4 I cant suggest that you pick up the expansion Fall of Setarrif. Its a poorly constructed add-on to a mediocre game.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Gamervision,35,Its a shame because theres likely something deep within thats worth paying attention to but it is surrounded so completely by problems that it simply cannot be worth the effort.

One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,ZTGD,35,I turned the game off with a One Way Trip to the delete key. I appreciate what they were going for here but it wasn’t for me in the slightest.
Alien Blast: The Encounter,PC,Feb-9-2004,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GameSpot,33,Across every category Alien Blast defines itself as the very epitome of boredom. The action is dull repetitive and in some cases a bit broken. The games graphics are pretty much a sad underdeveloped joke.
Robot Arena,PC,Apr-1-2001,Gabriel Interactive,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Breeding/Constructing,GameSpot,39,Even at the low retail cost of $19.99 Robot Arena isnt worth it. Youd end up getting more entertainment if you randomly chose two movies at an over-priced movie theater.
Rally Challenge 2000,Nintendo 64,Jun-30-2000,Europress,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,CNET Gamecenter,40,Although the actual car models are quite nice the N64s infamous fog--which makes for about 10 feet of visibility even in sunny conditions--and the blurry washed-out textures undermine the games few good points.
Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,PALGN,40,Emergency Heroes is a below average game that is ultimately far too dull to be enjoyable.
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,GameSpot,34,7554 is a modern curiosity that plays like a shabby relic.
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GamesRadar+,40,The soundtrack is a shocking state of affairs the cars sounding how you think mud would sound if it could talk and in the background is a Europop house soundtrack.
Timeline,PC,Nov-12-2000,Timeline Computer Entertainment,Action | General | General,All Game Guide,40,The battles the excitement and the potential mix of science fiction with history is all lost in a stilted game environment that was obviously crafted by Crichtons vision of what the game should be vs. the ultimate goal of creating a good game.
MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,GameFocus,35,MotionSports Adrenaline will inevitably find itself in the bargain bin a few months down the road and you will see it...then pass it on by for that fresh copy of Bomberman: Act Zero.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Wii,Nov-16-2010,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Nintendo Gamer,30,This is such a technical and conceptual mess that EA wouldnt send us a copy - we had to go out and buy it. [Christmas 2010 p.53]
The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,MEGamers,32,No matter how hard you look trying to find something good about this game you won’t come up with anything. Trust me I tried.
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,ZTGD,40,I was excited for the return of Gungrave. Especially since PlayStation VR had been so impressive for me recently diving into the technology. Sadly this experience is just not worth dropping the cash for. There are a ton of better VR experiences for Sony’s headset.
Waking,PC,Jun-18-2020,Jason Oda,Action | General,BaziCenter,40,They say never judge a book by the cover as whats inside almost always is better than whats outside. In Wakings case however the only pretty thing is the cover. Shallow and broken gameplay? Check. Bad controls? Check. Poor visuals? Check. Innovations?. Nowhere to be found. Worth a shot? Probably not.
JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,Trickstar Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Vandal,35,A less-than-satisfying return of the Janes series rebooting as an arcade game that doesnt feel good. Its gameplay is poor and limited its campaign boring and its online mode lacks variety.
Taito Legends Power-Up,PSP,May-17-2007,Empire Oxford,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Gamers Europe,30,Kazook is nothing but a host of buzzwords and heavily stereotyped characters mashed clumsily together with unoriginal games that quickly plummet into a repetitive tedium.
Rapala Tournament Fishing!,Wii,Nov-22-2006,MagicWand,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Game Almighty,35,Rapala Pro Fishing Trophy is a game that proves why fishing mini-games work so well in other games. It’s a little bit of fun for a short while but really lacks the depth (no pun intended) that a great fishing game needs.
DARK,PC,Jul-3-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Initially a terrible thing that becomes a relatively entertaining stealth action game if you manage to (literally) bite your way through. Unfortunately excellent ideas are screwed up by their problematic elaboration. [Issue#232]

Lets Fish! Hooked On,PlayStation Vita,Jan-29-2013,SIMS,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Gaming Nexus,35,I really wanted this to be good but it turned out to be a total mess. Let’s Fish is comprised of a bunch of great ideas and potential that never come to fruition. Its gameplay is overly simple and the technical aspects of the game are at odds with each other. Just stay away...far far away.
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,PC,Oct-17-2006,Apeiron,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | General | Modern,GameDaily,40,The game looks and plays cheaply and lacks direction. Players waste time trying to conduct solo missions early on when the heart of this game focus on squad tactics. Terrible translations boring environments and unintelligent enemies further ruin the experience.
Turtle Tale,3DS,May-22-2014,Saturnine Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,God is a Geek,30,Even at just shy of three quid this feels like poor value. Small developers should be taking these opportunities to create interesting and worthwhile ideas not pointless relics like Turtle Tale that belong on a Mastertronic cassette in the darkest recesses of gaming’s past.
Street Supremacy,PSP,Feb-28-2006,Genki,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Yahoo!,40,Street Supremacy may be pretty cool for its strategic twist but when actually getting behind the wheel is so ponderous and unengaging then for all you care those other gangs can just have Tokyo.
Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,Official Xbox Magazine,35,Unfortunately the major addition for its XBLA debut - Kinect integration - is poorly implemented leaving an otherwise shallow and dated experience.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,GamerFeed,40,Theres a decent selection of songs but the frequent loading limited game play and repetitive nature of the title just make it too boring for most to handle after a handful of sessions with the game.
101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix,Wii,Jan-13-2011,Nordcurrent,Sports | General | General,RealGamer,30,101-in-1 Sport Party Megamix is undoubtedly lacking the quality of its competition despite the fact that it features 101 mini-games to play.
007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Sweden,40,This mediocre Bond game brings nothing new. Almost saved by solid multiplayer fun and some cool gadgets but sadly the monotonic gameplay and almost identical boss fights sink what could have been a proper salute to the 50 year old movie franchise.
Mall Tycoon,PC,Feb-3-2002,Holistic Design | Inc.,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Game Over Online,38,Mall Tycoons anemic execution really turns any simulation aspects into micromanagement chaos.
Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project,Xbox 360,Jun-23-2010,3D Realms,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Horizontal,IGN,40,Maybe if the price was halved Id feel a little easier about the thought of people buying Manhattan Project but at its release its a rip-off compared what else is on the market.
Clash of the Titans,PlayStation 3,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Game Informer,40,The recent Clash of the Titans film was a mildly entertaining display of special effects. The game contains all of the films camp but lacks the spectacle of million-dollar CG krakens to help save it.
0 Day Attack on Earth,Xbox 360,Dec-23-2009,Gulti,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Kombo,35,Between the lackluster visuals and uninspired gameplay theres very little to like about 0 Day.
Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,PSFocus,39,Iron Man 2 the movie is pretty cool but the game is the complete opposite. The graphics are poor and look like those of a PlayStation 2 game and the audio isn’t great either. The gameplay is repetitive and there is no atmosphere in the game. Don’t buy this game it’s too bad and that’s a shame.
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,Gameblog.fr,40,Dollhouse has a fascinating universe but poor gameplay and poor graphics that makes it a frustrating experience.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,IGN,39,If your stupid game is as fun as watching a pet die as attractive as an eight-legged dwarf and as generally cool as getting your chest ruptured by an angered moose its bloody well not going to sell or be critically-freaking-acclaimed!
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Switch Player,30,Save your money on this one and opt for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Nickelodeon Kart Racers is not an enjoyable racer to play and whilst it has some interesting ideas adding an RPG element to the mix it doesnt make up for the rest of this half baked package.
Way of the Dogg,Xbox 360,May-3-2013,Echo Peak,General | Action | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Way of the Dogg is a squandered opportunity to fill a genre gap in the Arcade. Its a quick hours job to mop up 300G though. So theres always that.
4PM,PC,Jul-9-2014,Bojan Brbora,Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Multiplayer.it,30,4PM cant be considered a game rather it is an experiment. Poorly executed unfortunately. Bad visuals awkward narrative chunky controls make for an unacceptable 4 € price tag. Thumbs down.
WWII Aces,Wii,Mar-21-2008,Arcade Moon,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,GameSpot,35,WWII Aces is a frustrating ugly flight combat game with antiquated design elements and unresponsive motion controls.
Delta Force: Xtreme 2,PC,May-27-2009,NovaLogic,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,Absolute Games,40,This game’s failure was perfectly described back in 1865 by Lewis Carroll: Now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that! You cant stop the progress.
Slain!,PC,Mar-24-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Destructoid,35,Im sure it can and probably will get better over time with polish but whats here at launch is disappointing. I struggle to picture Slain! ever becoming genuinely good barring major reworks.
Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Destructoid,40,The bad news is that this entertaining and occasionally surprising narrative is wrapped around an inadequately polished Hitman knockoff.
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Gaming Age,33,The game needed a lot more time in development and it never got that opportunity to mature.
The Polar Express,GameCube,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,35,This is a kids game. Its also a bad kids game. And theres really no getting around that.
Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,IGN,35,Its one of those games that cuts so many corners you almost dont even notice that the same musical track plays through the whole thing because youve lowered your expectations so much.
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameSpot,34,Evil Dead: Hail to the King unfortunately offers little of the appeal of its source material as everything about the game is derivative boring or just plain bad.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Online deathmatches are an abandoned ship. [Sept 2010 p.81]
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,Metro GameCentral,30,It was arguably never very good even back in the day but playing it now The Chaos Engine’s basic action is hopelessly outclassed by any number of retro and contemporary titles.
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendojo,35,Anyone looking for a game that plays in the old Space Invaders style can surely find an arcade compilation somewhere. The just move right and left and shoot the enemies idea was great back in the 1980s but it just doesnt cut it by todays standards.
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Game Revolution,25,Too many technical problems and not enough fun drive this bike straight into the ground. Youll have more fun playing Hang On again with Shenmue.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,Stevivor,35,Ace Banana in its present state is barely playable with Move controllers.
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,GameSpot,38,Just about as broken as it was on the Xbox and PlayStation 2 last year and thanks to the ill-conceived introduction of a mouse and keyboard into the mix it manages to be even worse overall.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,IGN,40,Screwjumper! just should not have been green lit by Microsoft. There’s nothing redeeming about Screwjumper! no reason for anyone to give it a second look and absolutely no way you should spend ten bucks for the download.
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,PC Zone UK,39,The problems with the lack of inspiration or effort. [Christmas 2006 p.81]
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,RPGamer,30,At first I was enraged when I started to get killed all the time. Then I figured out how to just grind and the game became easy again until the final boss demanded further statistic embellishment to take down. Now that I have experienced the entirety of a Kemco title I too understand why this constantly-reviled publisher gets so much flak. Maybe other games under the Kemco banner are better: it wouldnt be hard.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,40,It isnt terrible its just dull. [Feb 2014 p.84]
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,GameShark,33,The game is extremely easy to finish in a single afternoon. Not that you should play it mind you. There are far better choices out there than Emergency Mayhem.
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GamePro,30,Protötheas music is the worst offender though -- its muffled tunelessness recalls the early days of hack composers attempting to extract vaguely music-like noise from the Super NESs default sound libraries. Expect lots of muddy bass and cheesy synth guitars.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Computer and Video Games,35,For every second of satisfaction there is a minute of monotony; where cardboard enemies fall under a cloud of red paint physics offer no value whatsoever AI is largely non-existent and gameplay follows the worn-ragged formula of coloured keycards and enemies that appear from thin air. [PC Zone]
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,You can enjoy the straightforward gameplay in some moments you can be surprised by the horror atmosphere. But those are only small details in the overall game of boredom disturbing mini-games and a bunch of bugs. [Mar 2009]

Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GameDaily,40,Despite the differing game play at least one element remains shared between the various situations and scenarios of Eureka Seven Vol. 2: boredom. With no real skill required to complete the simple challenges most gamers will breeze through the dull segments given enough time and button mashing leaving them to question the point in repeating those same bits of play over and over again.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,35,Unlike the show it’s based on it’s both deeply boring and devoid of imagination. For a real sense of adventure play Spelunky.
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Games Radar,30,Xiaolin Showdown is a bad game plain and simple. In a genre where speed and chaos is an important part of gameplay Xiaolin Showdowns fights are out and outright tedious.
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,No amount of ragdoll-fumbling can save this Gothic horror show. [Sept 2013 p.94]

Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,LevelUp,40,Escape Dead Island is a terrible game with substandard graphics unimaginative and rigid gameplay convoluted story and unforgivable optimization issues.
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,CD-Action,40,With its fantastic art direction Inner Chains could have been a great walker. Unfortunately what the developers decided to make is a lame uninspired awfully boring first-person shooter that has absolutely nothing to offer in terms of gameplay. [08/2017 p.72]
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,TeamXbox,44,So if you can get past its many flaws—or you just enjoy repeatedly having your ass handed to you—there’s quite a bit to do here for 800 Microsoft Points (about $10).
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Yahoo!,30,For the price youll pay for both these games -- which is what youll need to do if you want a half-decent selection of activities -- you could buy the far superior Brain Age. Or for that matter you could buy just about any of the other genuinely good games on the DS and pass over this cash-in altogether.
MTV Sports: Skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald,PlayStation,Sep-12-2000,Darkblack,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,CNET Gamecenter,30,A slovenly title that drowns in its own inferiority.
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,IGN,30,There’s no reason any self-respecting gamer would pick up Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury. The game is broken at times painful during others and sports and overall felling of frustration for anyone brave enough to endure it.
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,MEGamers,30,Blood Drive is like a radioactive element - admired from a distance but never to be touched.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,40,Not even the most dedicated fan of the TV show could find this piece of garbage entertaining. Lock this let-down up and throw away the key.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,40,The gang vernacular and the gratuitous use of swearing may make this game appear cool but you may as well listen to an Andrew Dice Clay recording and play with a string-less yo-yo.
Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu,Game Boy Advance,Nov-24-2003,Webfoot Technologies,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameZone,40,Taiketsu just doesnt work. With bad gameplay graphics sound and multiplayer it leaves this reviewer complaining more than Andy Rooney.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Push Square,40,Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse doesnt make the best use of its licence. The humour isnt as funny in this format and the experience is padded by repetitive fetch quests. Fans of the show may derive some enjoyment out of the in-jokes and multiplayer but everyone else should avoid at all costs.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Kombo,40,The Golden Compass the book has received more critical praise than it can count. Unfortunately the same doesnt hold true for the movie or the video game.
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,35,Predictably you’ll have a much better time blasting away in by-the-numbers deathmatch team deathmatch and capture-the-flag engagements — well if you can find any other players in the ghost town that passes for Scourge’s multiplayer lobby. Given the game’s crippling problems it’s hard to blame folks for staying away in droves.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,Vandal,40,Maybe Motionsports original idea to make use of Kinect possibilites to offer a varied set of sport challenge. was a good one but ultimately it has been poorly developed and executed and control doesnt work well enough.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,GamesRadar+,30,The biggest problem with Acme Arsenal is that it doesn’t contain an inkling of the depth on display in the classic cartoons its levels attempt to emulate.
Real Steel,Xbox 360,Oct-12-2011,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Vandal,30,Real Steel is not a noteworthy videogame. It is a shame because the idea could have been great if it had been well executed. It has a very limited and repetitive gameplay and a lackluster appearence.
Soldier Elite,PC,May-29-2006,Metropolis Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer,35,If theres one thing that blows chunks more than a bad console-to-PC port its a recycled low-budget PC game thats past its due. [Oct. 2006 p.58]
Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,Underwater third-person shooter is good for one and only one purpose: if you want to see every possible game mistake bug and bad design decision packed into one you just got it. [Apr 2012]
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,35,Easy short linear and with embarrasing flaws in AI this game is a huge disappointment.
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,Multiplayer.it,40,Montagues Mount is a bad graphic adventure plagued by the backtracking and some of the worst bugs seen in recent years.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,GameSpot,40,The console releases are better than the truly execrable PC game of the same name but theres still no reason for it to exist.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Yahoo!,40,With the bugs fixed and the gameplay tweaked and polished Superpower could be pretty decent. At the moment its disappointing.
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamePro,40,Its too bad because Cursed Crusade has fleetingly interesting ideas like forcing you to push a very slow-moving mantlet towards an enemys defensive line or the way the timing of tapping out combo strings actually encourages thoughtful player response. Co-op can actually be fun in short bursts with a friend and even the detailed aesthetic is surprisingly competent.
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Armchair Empire,35,Gameplay is where UBS really screws up.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Game Over Online,40,It’s something you’ll play for a little while but you’ll soon realize that watching the real thing is far more exciting. It sounds better. It feels faster. And you’ll get to see the podium and hear the anthem of the victor’s nation.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,30,Tiresome nonsense. [Sept 2007 p.40]
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,God is a Geek,40,Drive Girls is a disappointing game in almost every aspect with only a few redeeming factors.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,Computer Games Magazine,40,You have to be jonesing for a decidedly old school arcade experience to appreciate Air Raid and even then its fun for maybe 20-30 minutes at a time if not in total. [Nov 2003 p.101]
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Electric Playground,35,Hmmm...step on a landmine play Green Rogue. Landmine Green Rogue...Ah! Landmine it is!
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PC,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PC Format,34,A perfect storm of cynical derivative design and slipshod implementation. [June 2008 p.102]
25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,ActionTrip,32,The bottom line is that it doesnt come even close to the open-ended gameplay of GTA and the overall quality of Max Payne. Drawing any further comparison with these two well-known titles would be a waste of time. In fact the entire game is a waste of time and money.
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GamerNode,35,Incredibly easy to use driving flop.
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Play UK,32,Unforgivable bugs. [Issue#220 p.81]
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Nintendo Gamer,35,Experimental racing concepts should be tested in the developers studios not on shop shelves. [Sept 2008 p.54]
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,A longer development period might have made this into something more playable but it would still be a game of rehashed concepts notable only for its sheer banality. [May 2017 p.96]
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,FNintendo,30,Its hard to recommend Senran Kagura Reflexions to anyone at all. Rather than a game this is more like a collection of screens that test the accuracy of the Joy-Con movements and at that it does work. Unfortunately it fails at everything else and it simple does not provide the content the sense of purpose and the structure necessary to call this a fun interactive experience.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Level7.nu,40,Manage a theme park and build grand roller coasters. A poorly designed user interface old-fashioned graphics and the lack of certain mechanics makes sure that this game never lives up to its PC predecessors.
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Yahoo!,30,For the price youll pay for both these games -- which is what youll need to do if you want a half-decent selection of activities -- you could buy the far superior Brain Age. Or for that matter you could buy just about any of the other genuinely good games on the DS and pass over this cash-in altogether.
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,31,An ugly collection of poorly conceived minigames The Polar Express is a failure by the standards of any medium.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,38,The game isnt funny and thats inexcusable.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,GameBiz,35,The musical score of the game will get on most peoples nerves within the first 20 minutes.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameShark,33,25 to Life does include a somewhat entertaining multiplayer aspect but not enough to keep your attention for very long.
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,NintendoWorldReport,40,You might be able to derive some enjoyment from this game but it requires overlooking absolutely essential elements gone awry making Hello Neighbor very difficult to recommend. If you don’t mind solving abstract puzzles and throwing everything (including the kitchen sink) at your objectives all while constantly avoiding a particularly annoying antagonist then you might give this game a try.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,IGN,35,The controls are awkward there’s no Xbox 360 Chatpad support and the puzzles are mediocre at best (and repetitive at worst).
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Meristation,35,Theres nothing worthy on the latest feelPlus work or at least nothing truly enjoyable. Were supposed to be very frightened by the scares that The Grudge repeatedly shows on the screen but the only scary thing here are the gameplay mechanics and the incredible stupidity of our main enemies.
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Portugal,30,Thor: God of Thunder is a game to avoid.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamingTrend,34,I have reviewed some bad games but this is even bad even for movie tie-in games. This is bad on the level of Aquaman bad.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,PC,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | Shooter | General | First-Person | Modern,3DJuegos,32,Raven Squad is bland boring and definitely not fun. Avoid it at all cost.
Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendophiles,30,Scream Arena takes a line from the movie and creates and entire game from it. It’s so thin that the single line in the movie is more entertaining.
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,33,So this is a pretty ordinary game that has potential in some areas.
Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,Xbox 360,Feb-10-2009,Tamsoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,Gaming Age,33,For me Onechanbara represents one of the biggest disappointments Ive felt in a game—it looks silly action packed and a little fun. Instead its just repetitive drivel with a bit of cheesecake.
Tony Hawk's Motion,DS,Nov-18-2008,Creat Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Pocket Gamer UK,30,Saddled with poor visuals ineffective controls and a complete lack of engaging content Tony Hawks Motion is a crushing disappointment .
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,Wii,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Nintendo Gamer,36,Instead of giving you the game disc the sales assistant could open the box and curl out a steaming log in there and youd have almost as much fun playing with it. [Dec 2008 p.56]
Cartoon Network Racing,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade,IGN,34,A bad kart racer in every sense of the word. The track design is poor the game feels slow and worst of all the controls are terrible.
The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,GamingTrend,35,I stared deep into the eyes of the deer waiting for it to speak. There was no grass no trees; just a white void surrounding me and her heavenly grace as she judged me and my actions. But she did not speak. She did not even blink. As the silence dragged on I grew more desperate bargaining with her to just make sense of this please! What should I be feeling? What should I be believing!? Deer God what lesson do I need to learn? She screamed for she did not know. I screamed for I did not know. Perhaps that was the lesson to learn that there is nothing to know. Don’t buy this game.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,Game Chronicles,23,You do nothing else while playing but hit the start and end button occasionally buy things for your store and manage employees.
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,TotalGames.net,37,To think this dire piece of programming is worth 40p let along £40 is an insult to everything we believe in as dedicated gamers. Buy it...go on we dare you. You’ll be the only fool that does...
Resident Evil: Survivor,PlayStation,Aug-30-2000,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,CNET Gamecenter,40,This lame first-person shooter with no visual or visceral delights is an insult to the brand name that is Resident Evil.
Realms of Ancient War,PC,Oct-4-2012,Wizarbox,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,XGN,35,In every review the main question is why would the consumer buy this? For R.A.W. Realms of Ancient War that is a question hard to answer. Yes it is an action RPG like great titles such as Diablo III and Torchlight II. But no we wouldnt recommend this game to anyone.
Inkheart,DS,Jan-12-2009,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | General | General,Armchair Empire,30,If you love the movie you might want to try this out just to see what it’s all about. If you are hankering for a decent adventure game with a book twist go grab Hotel Dusk: Room 215. It’s a much better read.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,Despite some noble efforts to take Tony Hawks back to its roots Pro Skater 5 is ruined by glitches sluggish movement and dull lifeless levels. What might have been a glorious return ends up an unfortunate swan song. [Issue#130 p.78]
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,PALGN,35,Quirky minigames can be excellent fun but the best collections offer variety. Spinning a wheel ad infinitum just doesnt cut it.
Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,3DJuegos,33,Pacific Rim is a very bad fighting game with a popular license.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,IGN,31,Nearly every gamplay mechanic fails in one way or another. While the game is functional Alone in the Dark is a clear case of something that needed to be baked in the oven longer. The overall concept is solid but the testing phase seems to have been glossed over.
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Next Level Gaming,40,The game is hampered by very bad laggy gameplay that seems like in some of the game levels (mostly all of them) it is running at 5 fps.
Putty Squad,PlayStation 4,Mar-11-2014,System 3,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Metro GameCentral,30,It seems very unfair to suddenly thrust such a dated game back into the limelight but it ready would’ve been better if Putty Squad had stayed in retirement.
Motocross Mania 3,Xbox,Apr-27-2005,Deibus Studios,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,IGN,38,Poor controls buggy gameplay and a lack of variety make this game a tour de garbage.
Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,PALGN,25,Saying that the DS version of Burnout Legends is bad is quite generous. Abomination is a much more fitting word.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,VideoGamer,30,While Dead or Alive: Paradise may appear exciting to a sex-starved 16-year-old the game is insulting to all other audiences; a huge backwards step in an industry desperately trying to mature. Remember this kids: ultimately youre getting yourself worked up over polygon meshes skin coloured textures and clever algorithms. Unless youre really struggling for ways to entertain your libido the game should be categorically avoided.
Battleship,Xbox 360,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Tactical,GameSpot,35,Bland presentation and sloppy mechanics sink Battleship more effectively than a torpedo ever could.
Battle: Los Angeles,PC,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Gamer,30,Good grief--I could buy Half-Life 2 with that $10. [Aug 2011 p.76]
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,Thunderbolt,30,Better yet let’s just leave the on-rails style in the ’90s where it belongs. It’s been a nice ride but we need to start moving on.
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,Everyeye.it,35,You need an extra dose of Painkillers to play Resurrection without headache.
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Wccftech,36,Umbrella Corp is a game that should have been scrapped not released. It may have started with the best intentions but the end result is a game that relies on tired gameplay and a familiar name. Going back to the drawing board would have been better than what was released now.
G.I. Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,GameSpot,30,G.I. Combats biggest shortcoming is that it has very little gameplay. Instead it has a heap of confusion.
Driven,PlayStation 2,Nov-6-2001,Bam Entertainment,Driving | Racing | Formula One,GameSpot,29,You can accelerate up to 200mph within seconds and survive a brutal wall impact but a low-speed scuff on the turf sends your car spinning.
Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Planet Xbox 360,33,If mind-numbingly easy repetition is what you enjoy in a game knock yourself out.
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameShark,33,Godzilla Unleashed lacks the vibrant larger-than-life destructive mayhem of other Godzilla titles and there really arent enough redeeming qualities otherwise to warrant a purchase…or even a rental.
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Games.cz,30,Darks concept is totally out of line and its technical issues are not helping it. Sometimes a good theme occurs but its bad gaming mechanics tread in the game quickly. Its bad as a stealth-action game. Its even worse as a vampire title.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,CD-Action,40,None of its elements is done well enough. The combat system is primitive and slapdash there’s practically just one enemy type with several skins and the level design based on simple greyish blocks is trivial. [CD-Action 06/2013 p.68]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,The Digital Fix,30,What we are left with is a dull broken button-masher of a campaign a risible barely playable multiplayer game and a couch co-op which puts most players on a level playing field with Mr. Magoo.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,GameSpot,35,Shallow combat frustrating exploration and crippling technical issues make Dragon Blade Chronicles a Naruto adventure to avoid.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamePro,35,In truth the biggest mystery here isnt how vampires evolved and rose to power but how any publisher could justify a $60 price tag for a tiresome exercise in imitation and slipshod execution.
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,IGN,30,If I havent made my point excruciatingly clear by now let me be very blunt -- do not play this game. Its plodding and dull and isnt even fun in an unintentional way. Just stay away.
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,MondoXbox,40,Project Root presents a very good base idea but with a poor implementation; we liked the idea of a top-down 360 degrees non-linear shooter but its generic art design many glitches and bad game design decisions keep it from even touching its full potential.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,IGN,35,It’s impossible to give that feeling when players have so little control over their own performance. If you’re looking for a golf game to play on Wii there are plenty to choose from. This one’s definitely not worth the price of admission.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,Destructoid,30,Just another ruined idea to throw on the ever-increasing pile. Not even the fact that one of the lines includes the term Satans little piss-pot could save this.
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,Game Over Online,30,Believe me Seven Kingdoms Conquest is a wreck you want to avoid.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,IGN,35,Kengos environment-based attacks nine storylines and Combat Mode simply arent enough to recommend what amounts to a boring and repetitive gameplay experience.
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,TotalGames.net,38,It’s sluggish and unresponsive and absolutely riddled with annoying bugs that should have been detected early in the production process.
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,Gaming Age,33,It was a mediocre game when it first came out seven years ago and if anything the benefit of time has made the mediocre assessment seem generous.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GamesRadar+,30,Rock Revolution is inferior to its competition in every single possible way. If you absolutely have to try it we urge you to think of it as a track pack of guitar-only songs for Rock Band or Guitar Hero and buy just the game (instead of the drums-included bundle).
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GamesRadar+,30,You’ll need the patience of Buddist monk to progress through the archaic Quest mode without consistently resorting to a cheap Ring Out.
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GamingTrend,30,Honestly the nicest thing I can say about Heavy Fire: Red Shadow is that it’s over in two hours. It is at least technically playable with some interesting mechanics. But even if you are specifically looking for a wave-based arcade-style turret game I’d still stay away. This game offers little of value and is fun only if I stretch that word beyond its absolute limit.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameSpot,37,Feels like a rushed hack-job of a game with just barely enough cohesive action to keep it from completely falling apart at the seams.
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Eurogamer Germany,30,In some weird way all of Lost Swords bad ideas remind you why you once loved the series.
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Not buying this would be the ultimate lucky escape. [May 2017 p.92]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,NZGamer,35,Maybe EA Games could rename Part 2 Harry Potter and the Multiple Revenue Streams. Because if we are going to be honest thats all this title really is.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,PC Gamer,38,Frustrating buggy and overly dependent on trial-and-error this is a missed opportunity.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PALGN,35,Unfortunately Acme Arsenal never really delivers. The gameplay is repetitive and bland never really offering a great deal of enjoyment. One of Bug’s quips as he topples enemies in the game is now this is fun. We’re sorry Bug’s but you’re sorely mistaken.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,DC Swirl,20,Acclaim needs a new engine and they need it to be radiclly different.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer UK,37,Smug poorly made and incredibly frustrating to play they managed the fearfully but not the wonderfully made. [Apr 2007 p.86]
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,30,Its an infuriatingly unbalanced unpolished and underwhelming experience that nobody -- not even fans of the movies -- should spend money on.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,GMR Magazine,30,This game is underthought quarterbaked and hopeless. Its one of the worst games on the PS2. [Feb 2003 p.66]
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Electronic Gaming Monthly,22,Its one of the worst games Ive ever played. [July 2002 p.128]
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Nintendo Power,32,Hit-and-miss action. [May 2002 p.140]
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,GameFocus,30,Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor is a great game when Kinect decides to obey to your actions but when there are simply too many switches levers and buttons in the game for Kinect to decipher what you are actually wanting to do it just makes the experience extremely aggravating.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,35,While it does have a lot of fan service it really doesn’t have much else besides clunky gameplay horrible visuals and repetitive gameplay.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Worth Playing,32,Normally a title like this would garner a much higher score; due to the inherent bugs however it feels like the game is half-finished. Since it seems only halfway complete the score will also be roughly half of what it would be in normal circumstances.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,Kombo,35,Soccer is a simple sport that relies on execution and precise play. Pure Futbol is executed poorly and is an imprecise mess.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameZone,30,Its not shocking that a movie game is terrible but it is somewhat surprising since Harry Potters last two games have been fairly good. The uninspired levels horrendous shooting mechanics lackluster controls and a tacked-on Kinect mode make this one Harry Potter piece of merchandise fans should stay far far away from.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,32,A bad conversion of an almost year-old Xbox game. Vengeance is playable but its a massively disappointing Wii debut for the Far Cry series and the worst FPS on the console so far. [Mar 2007 p.84]
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,35,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle originally started out as a PlayStation Vita game and would have released there a few months ago but for NIS Americas desire to do a simultaneous multiplatform release. A game of this quality wouldnt have been acceptable on the Vita and being on the Switch is only serving to expose its myriad flaws to more people. If you need to see girls beat the snot out of each other on the Switch theres already plenty of better options.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,New Game Network,34,The metroidvania-lover in me wished Randall turned out to be more enjoyable. There are some interesting ideas here like the use of mind control but the good of that is buried under a litany of technical problems and just general sloppy design. Like the titular hero I found myself frequently battling headaches during my time with the game.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,eToychest,30,Fans of the series will find absolutely nothing to like here and it’s likely that any gamer making Dark Secret their first Tenchu game will never buy another one.
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,AceGamez,40,This shovelware deserves no space in your home.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,GameSpot,39,Its not as if the Olympics be it summer or winter has had anything special to call its own when it comes to video game adaptations over the years but Torino 2006 is especially egregious in that it pares down the number of included events to a fairly measly number manages to make every single one of them completely uninteresting and skimps entirely on the presentation.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,GameTrailers,33,Pocket Pool is just another miserable attempt at using sex to sell a terrible game. While there aren’t many billiard options for the PSP pool fans should look elsewhere and avoid the embarrassment of their girlfriend catching them playing with it.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,Kombo,35,There are parts to like about Speed Zone and it wins some merit badges for the split-screen option. What doesnt go over well is perhaps one of the most crucial parts to a racing game the ability to control your vehicle.
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Cheat Code Central,30,The PSP version has so many things against it: the gameplay is terrible the story is non-existent and the entire game experience ranges from boring to enraging depending on how long youve been playing. I feel almost guilty giving ANY game this bad of a review. But trust me this one earned it.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,GameDaily,40,If you love the antics of Aqua Teen Hunger Force consider yourself warned -- Zombie Ninja Pro-Am is a bland affair. You get a subpar (no pun intended) golf game a lame cart-racing game and heaping amounts of monotonous combat.
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Electronic Gaming Monthly,30,Cmon were talking about a hack-and-slasher with stationary pinatas for targets here! [August 2002 p.126]
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameZone,32,There’s very little to like about the Nintendo Wii version of Legend of the Dragon and the fact that very little effort was placed in making the Wii technology fit the game is reason enough to skip this one.
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,A truly rubbish shooter that lies deep in Gears shadow pillaging it for set pieces designs and mechanics with zero subtlety. [Issue#64 p.89]
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,IGN,40,Like I say then leave this sucker alone.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,TeamXbox,36,Poor combat mechanics coupled with simplistic controls is where Fight Club begins to fall apart. A weak storyline that feels more like bits and pieces from a larger story told through still images rather than animated scenes takes so much more away from the game then they add making the process of playing through Fight Club more of an exercise in futility than entertaining.
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Games Master UK,31,Frustrating stealth sections uninspired puzzling and dull action make Agony gaming hell. [Aug 2018 p.73]
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,PALGN,30,A dull and poorly designed game. The mini-games are boring you cant save in-game and youll be waiting around a lot of the time. This is just a quickly rushed license title.
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,IGN,30,Its a slow and dull action game with very little technique. Top that off with NO MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT and theres really no reason to play this game. Its not fun.
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Gamestyle,30,Overall this is a hugely disappointing release from Midway who had seemed to be on an upward trend over the past few years. Hopefully Hour of Victory is the exception as this should have been binned long before arriving exclusively on the Xbox 360.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,35,Blackwater is a definite step in the right direction to providing the motion-based FPS like the one promised when Microsoft announced their Kinect camera peripheral. But between the controversial backstory the dicey subject matter the terrible presentation and the sketchy controls it is a game that is better left on the shelf. If you want a better Kinect shooter experience check out Gunstringer.
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,All Game Guide,30,Ostensibly a fast-paced adrenaline-style rendition of football the Game Boy Advance version of Blitz is a slow bare-bones pigskin game that bears little resemblance to its souped-up arcade inspiration.
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,Twinfinite,30,Left Alive’s half-baked nature feels like a real pity because quite a few elements of the game are actually really interesting.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Gamer's Pulse,40,The graphics are simply poor. The sound is painful to the ears at time although it stuck very close to the original game.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Planet Xbox 360,33,What at first sounds like fun for the whole family turns out to be a bad case of fun for nobody. Rocky And Bullwinkle is an unfortunate case of a good license slapped on a terrible excuse for a game.
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,Screen Rant,30,Every mechanic to the game needs drastic improvements and its just plain unfortunate that Otherside Entertainment released the game as-is.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameZone,37,Sometimes a game is just no fun this is one of those times.
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,VideoGamer,30,Its awful. As it is its a disaster of a fighting game. If the boxing in Wii Sports is Amir Khan then Ready 2 Rumble Revolution is Frank Bruno.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,IGN,31,An all around mess of a game Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing is officially one of (if not THE) worst examples of digital boxing weve ever seen.
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Push Square,30,Crystal Rift is far from an enjoyable experience with cumbersome controls lacklustre visuals and poor enemy AI. The entire experience gets very tiresome very quickly and with the ever increasing expectations for great quality games this just doesnt cut it. This rift would be better left unexplored unless you think youd enjoy its torturously repetitive depths.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,GameShark,26,Id have to use both my fingers and toes to tally up how many times the character suddenly materialized through a wall or walkway or big lethal spike-thingy and so on.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,GamePro,30,The crummy gameplay combined with Frogger 2s deceiving graphics (kids will struggle with this game) and jab-a-screwdriver-into-your-ear music make this one of the worst titles available on XBLA.
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Nintendo Power,35,Stiff controls and sloppy collision detection certainly dont help matters nor do the truly atrocious production values. [July 2007 p.94]
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,35,The mini-games are shallow and one-player only each turn drags on far too long and the sheer lack of any actual party elements keeps it from attaining even the basic – yet still redundant – entertainment found in the long-lived Mario Party series.
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Switch Brasil,30,Apparently Nintendo had to revisit Urban Champion at least once. We should all be happy thats out of the way now hoping that true classics show up next in the eShop as 3D Classics.
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Vandal,30,Lucha Fury is hardly recommendable even for diehard beatem up fans.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,30,Fluster Cluck seemed like it might be fun and have potential as a party game but I would honestly be more embarrassed to load this up and try to convince people to play it.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Computer Games Magazine,30,A great concept gone horribly wrong... Its too short too dull and too poorly executed. [Oct 2002 p.75]
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,GameGrin,30,I’ve read scarier issues of the Beano in this clunky buggy mess of a wanna be Deadly Premonition.
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,Cheat Code Central,34,When your game makes you want to skip the egregiously tedious gameplay so you can see what happens in the utterly forgettable story you know youre doing something wrong.
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,Game Chronicles,33,I honestly have to say that I had fun with this game just because the gameplay is so outrageously bad.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Level7.nu,30,Battle for the Pacific is a perfect example of how you can produce a modern first person shooter with absolutely no level of innovation at all. Graphics sound and controls all do their job without impressing but the overall gameplay is utterly mediocre and not worth your time or your money.
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,IGN,30,When the essential gameplay mechanic is this flawed and theres nothing else to save it theres simply no reason to play it.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,RewiredMind,30,I expected Torino 2006 to use its licence to present a confident and solid portrayal of the Olympic experience. It does neither – to be quite frank – and feels like an incredibly rushed affair.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,PC PowerPlay,20,A crime. Send this one to the colonies. [Feb 2011 p.65]
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,God is a Geek,30,A poorly written game with gameplay that feels stiff and archaic along with endless waves of enemies that take far too long to beat.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Cheat Code Central,30,This game borders on blasphemy... What you get is a slow paced game of hide and seek where it seems no one even cares to come looking for you.
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,VideoGamer,30,Kung Fu Riders bizarre and broken controls bear little correlation to whats going on in the screen and overall the game would function far more effectively if its commands were simply mapped to a DualShock controller. It would still remain utterly terrible however as the game is an uninspired mess built entirely around a core conceit that gets old surprisingly fast.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,40,NBA Live 14 is one of the worst sports games I played in years. Its incredible that the game shares the same engine with FIFA 14 and Madden 25 because of its choppy gameplay poor graphics and the lack of any ideas. 2K can sleep well.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Digitally Downloaded,30,There are some great ideas at the core of this though and it would have been nice to see how they shaped up with a bit more direction and some extra time in the oven.
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,IGN,35,Its ugliness assaults your senses right from the start.

Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer,30,At best its a functional third-person platformer that sometimes acts like a shooter. At worst its an astonishing collection of poor design decisions half-hearted implementation and mindless narrative clutter that will only lead to buyers remorse in all who decide to give it a try.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,PSM3 Magazine UK,31,Even the most rabid of fans will be disappointed. [Sept 2007 p.80]
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,30,Orion: Dino Beatdown is a disaster. Bugs glitch and the lack of contents plague the entire production. It is more an alpha version than a finished game.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Console Monster,25,With a poor story out-dated graphics and no real depth to the puzzles and with so many great titles in the genre already available for the same price I would suggest you steer clear of this one.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Cheat Code Central,38,There are songs to play you cant get anywhere else but you should really ask yourself if you to play them on a real-fake guitar.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Kombo,25,The game isnt fun. The load times graphics presentation and lack of readable fonts and radars makes this game unplayable.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,28,Celebrity Deathmatchs biggest problem isnt its timing but rather its the absolutely horrid gameplay and complete lack of any worthwhile features.

Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,TheSixthAxis,30,It’s not impossible to overlook Alekhine’s shopping list of shortcomings. There were a few occasions when everything would neatly come together and create something genuinely fun and entertaining. However the consistency simply isn’t there.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Nintendojo,30,It shall garner the first ever Eric Mattei Smelly Bowling Shoe award for achieving a new standard in caca quality.
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,30,Torrente may just be a new Spanish word for ‘terrible’.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Games.cz,30,Umbrella Corps is a multiplayer action with zero value. The game is flawed with all sorts of issues including dysfunctional matchmaking small number of players poor visuals and tragic AI of zombies. Hands off.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,It felt genuinely good to not be playing it anymore and that is a rare thing in games nowadays. [Oct 2014 p.92]
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,GameZone,31,Boring in all fronts: graphics gameplay audio etc. There’s not many redeeming values packed into Double D Dodgeball so the best advice is to play the demo and call it good.
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Cubed3,30,Arc of Alchemist feels so very dated it could easily be confused for an early Idea Factory title getting its remaster on Switch… without anything actually remastered. Unremarkable and uninspired its a quintessential mindless dungeon-crawling RPG with no real hook to set it apart. There are a million games out there that do exactly what Arc of Alchemist does but better in every way.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,37,A resounding failure. Unless youre a masochistic Fight Club fan looking to purposely have your sensibilities offended then youd be well advised to stay far away from this game.
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PSX-Sense.nl,20,What a horrible game. Combat is stiff and unpleasant. The badly positioned camera constantly gets on your nerves. Where to go and what to do is totally unclear. Bosses are uninspired and no fun at all. Everything in this game screams ignore me! so thats our advice to you. Do not buy this game - you have been warned!
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,Video Chums,25,In an age where people watch other people play video games maybe its time that video games simply play themselves. Hopefully that statement sounds ridiculous to you because it is. Gamers need gameplay and Tokyo Tattoo Girls has virtually none.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,PSX-Sense.nl,35,This game should have been the ultimate fan service to One Piece fans but unfortunately the game severely disappoints. The limited gameplay that the title offers is repetitive and doesnt add a whole lot. The parts where youre blasting ships and a Kraken is fun but wears thin very quickly. One Piece: Grand Cruise definitely had potential but the developer didnt take any chances at all.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,TeamXbox,34,The dictionary defines infernal as hellish fiendish diabolical as it should be but it also has a definition of extremely troublesome annoying. Unfortunately Infernal lives up to both of those definitions all too well.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,30,Terrible. Probably the only good thing to come out of the whole experience is the games opening song. Just imagine a driving 80s generic pop anthem with cheesy power chords and lyrics about how war is love and love is war.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,Gamers' Temple,40,If Jackass the show were as bland as Jackass the game it would have been cancelled after one episode.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpot,30,One of the worst action games of the last 10 years.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Computer Games Magazine,33,Enemy AI is shoddy as is the hit-detection. The graphics are also deficient with nearly every element in the game looking bland. [Apr 2004 p.9]
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,1UP,30,As I painfully maneuvered my Charlie from room to room I grew more and more desperate in my attempt to find redeeming qualities in the game.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,IGN,35,Apart from the energetic musical score theres nothing good about the Nintendo DS game. This is simply shelf fodder the game grandparents will blindly buy for Little Timmy because the parents took him to see the movie.
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,GameWatcher,30,When both the story and the gameplay are as weak as this then youre better leaving this on the virtual shelf and picking up Dead Space Extraction instead.
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,Destructoid,30,Its disappointing to see this sold on Xbox One and PS4 (with a retail release!) as if it is completed game. It clearly is not. After some substantial updates Id potentially want to give it another chance but as is I wouldnt want to spend another minute with it.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,TotalGames.net,30,Well we need a licence for sure...and how about some cool bands for the soundtrack?...Well I can’t think what else I would have written.Urm… I think we’re done.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gamestyle,30,The 2.5D graphics are quite nice and it captures the character and environment well but overall we can only really recommend this to parents who want to shut their kids up for five minutes.
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,34,This game is clearly a rushed mess and perhaps should have taken a nod from the Superman Returns video game and not been released until The Golden Compass inevitable DVD release.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,games(TM),30,To judge Enemy Front as a sum of its parts reveals it to be an FPS fraud - a pretender. [Sept 2014 p.104]
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,Nintendojo,20,Given that Wii Sports boxing (or Punch-Out!! for that matter) is better in almost every conceivable way Showtime Championship Boxing has absolutely no business in your gaming library not even for $20. Stay far away.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,GamerFeed,30,Fails to excite in any way shape or form.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpot,30,Even for the budget price tag that Miami Takedown is retailing for this bomb is a horrible choice for anyone and it should absolutely be avoided.
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,XboxAddict,34,This is unfortunately not a good detective game nor is it a good game period.
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,PC Zone UK,30,Even at its bargain price MOB is frankly appalling. [July 2009 p.73]
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,30,When a games only achievement is that its a better World War II shooter than Hour of Victory--and just barely--its time to pack it up and just go home. [Feb 2008 p.79]
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,CD-Action,30,Dear Kung Fu Factory please try harder next time because you showed some potential but I had to look for it through a microscope. [13/2013 p.73]
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,GamePro,30,Theres really no good reason to suffer Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga--its ugly broken and seems hellbent on depriving you of fun at every opportunity. Even if youre hard up for a Wii RPG youre better off skipping it and never looking back. Meanwhile Ill be hearing those footsteps echoing endlessly in my nightmares.
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,The Overpowered Noobs,30,If your goal is to never have an interaction beyond your basement this game delivers. Otherwise its only function is to give players a few laughs and severe second-hand embarrassment. Alternatively it could be turned into a drinking game with your buddies: Take a shot every time the camera goes out of focus the acronym PUA is said or there’s an opportunity to whip Big Richie out.
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Armchair Empire,30,Other than intentionally funny games like Day of the Tentacle and Monkey Island I don’t think I’ve ever laughed more at a game than I did at Fugitive Hunter.
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Five hours of playing this game will kill the entire genre for you too. [Aug 2011 p.99]
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,Eurogamer,30,King of Clubs doesnt play a very good game of golf and the unlockable elements do little to counteract this rather glaring flaw.
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Nintendo Life,30,With sluggish gameplay off-putting presentation and bafflingly poor design decisions at every turn Langrisser Re:Incarnation Tensei is an entirely underwhelming revival of a once-beloved series and a subpar SRPG besides.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PlayStation Universe,30,Shellshock 2 will shock you but for all the wrong reasons. Even if youre a fan of the genre its a technically inept and totally unenjoyable experience.
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,DarkStation,30,To put it bluntly don’t bother with Fireburst.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,GRYOnline.pl,30,Rambo: The Video Game is an awkward short ugly and expensive game that tries to generate some nostalgia but ultimately fails. Instead of spending money on Teyons creation its better to watch the entire game on YouTube or better yet - watch all the movies. And the best thing to do is: go for a walk find a video arcade and beat Virtua Cop one more time.
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,IGN,27,Poor graphics horrible animation and the lack of any challenge far outweigh whatever story this game might have.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,ZTGD,29,As a fan of competent twin stick shooters I found nothing at all in The Expendables 2 that would warrant me to recommend this game in any way. Boring gameplay drab levels and poorly produced content are the headliners here; avoid at all costs even if you are a fan of the movies. There are better games in this vein to spend your money on and one of them Tomb Raider: Guardian of Light is even free at the moment if you have a Playstation Plus subscription.
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Gamer's Pulse,30,The controls and gameplay are as poorly designed as the graphics and audio.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Gamer,25,Its not even remotely close to being fun and serves as a fine example of how not to make an action game. [Sept 2011 p.77]
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,IGN Italia,30,Please dont get fooled by Serellans proclamations and dont fall in the trap. Takedown: Red Sabre is a terrible first person shooter ugly to watch and painful to play. You wont get any fun from it even if you insist on fighting against its flaws. Stay away from it.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GamesRadar+,30,Avoid this one unless you’re a sucker for dickhead aliens. The Path of the Furon leads straight to disappointment.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Pelit (Finland),30,This game tries to ride with the same horse as Telltale. Although the names are identical the games themselves are just the opposite of one another. This is utter garbage in every single meter. Steer away. [May 2013]
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Its a genuinely bad game in every respect. [May 2018 p.82]
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendojo,35,The selling point of this game seems to be some sort of edutainment. Yet besides a few scant factoids in between levels the game boasts nothing worth teaching.
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Laborious and horribly put together Agony really will put you through hell. [Aug 2018 p.78]
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,30,To quote Galvatron This is bad comedy. [Aug 2011 p.90]
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,PC Gamer UK,36,Why am I empty then? Perhaps because this crass banal unchallenging belch of a first person shooter has left me that way groaning and giggling like a mental patient. [Nov 2007 p.72]
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,NintendoWorldReport,30,Do yourself a favor and hunt down the GBA game if you have an Astro Boy craving. Just ignore this pile which is 100 percent pure uncut shovelware.
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,Talk Xbox,28,The game play was weak the graphics weak and the audio even worse. I was fed up and bored with this game after just a mere six minutes of playtime.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,TheSixthAxis,30,It’s rare that I can’t find positives to talk about in detail and it’s a real shame that Fantasy Hero ~Unsigned Legacy~ game wasn’t improved in any way but simply ported with no tangible improvements over the PS Vita original. Fantasy Hero has the occasional solid mechanic in place but neither the story nor its gameplay boast any interest or originality. This game may have been considered pretty average upon its original release in 2014 but by modern standards it’s incredibly poor.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Computer Games Magazine,30,Just buy it on DVD and leave it at that. [Apr 2007 p.71]
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Gamereactor Sweden,30,There are loads of great fighting games out on the market right now. Girl Fight is not one of them and if you desperately need to watch girls fight there are probably better options for that as well.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,Electronic Gaming Monthly,27,The completely screwed-up camera noticeable lack of sound effects and gameplay bugs make it obvious no one working on this game cared about it - why should you? [Sept 2004 p.104]
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,GameSpot,27,It truly manages to re-create what it must be like to be on the wrong end of a mob shakedown because by the end of the experience youll pretty much feel like youve had your head caved in with a lead pipe.
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,Lets just say that the only way to ruin a party quicker than loading up Shrek Super Party is to load up Nickelodeon Party Blast. Stay away!
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Game Informer,30,As a downloadable title I wasnt expecting Amy to measure up against the triple-A juggernauts of the survival horror genre. However I was expecting a game that was at least playable and contained some kind of entertainment. Make no mistake: Whether Amy is delivered to you via download retail SKU direct brain wave or retinal implant it is terrible and should be avoided.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GamerNode,20,Compared to the quality of other PSN titles Kick-Ass does nothing to stand out. An array of unforgivable technical issues mar what is already a needlessly boring and repetitious beatem-up.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,Thunderbolt,20,The game is short damn short. It can be finished in about an hour or so and once you have sussed out the way the simple strategy part works all further enjoyment can only be derived from the main missions which Im sure youll realise by now cant save this Superman.
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,Play (Poland),30,Its huge. Its green. Its bad. And its lame. The comic and the movie rock but on a PC Hulk receives a thrashing from any budget arcade game. [Aug 2008]
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,netjak,30,The big draw aside from the fun cheating Mike Tyson parts is the damage textures applied to the face and the little blood spurts and sweat coming off your boxers face after he takes a punch...Once you take so many hits your boxer will go from bruised to cut to Face Critical! Whoopty-doo. One feature doesnt make your entire game Codemasters.
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,GameOver.gr,30,Thank God our daily bread and cereal is not dependent on this game.
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,Eurogamer Germany,30,Long story short: In its current state X Rebirth is just a sad affair.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,God is a Geek,30,Dawn of Fear is a poor attempt to recreate the magic of a survival horror classic with too many problems to gain any sense of enjoyment. Brok3nsite has tried to create a nostalgic tribute to Resident Evil but in the process they’ve somehow made it worse than the original. Perhaps its biggest omission and ultimate failure is its scare factor creating predictable moments of terror that never hit as they should.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,IGN,25,An absolute crapfest of a portable experience.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Play Magazine,25,Both the fighting and exploration are poorly executed and the visuals look like they leapt right out of a medium-quality NES title. [Jan 2004 p.76]
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Electric Playground,25,Dark Armies wretchedly tells you exactly what you need to do (i.e. move your units down by those trees and change their formation) but never gives even the slightest hint in the direction of the almighty how the hell that is done (i.e. what combination of keys and mouse buttons you must manipulate to get an action done).
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,Games Master UK,31,A poor game with next to no modes excitement or stuff to recommend it. [July 2006 p.84]
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Portugal,30,A frustrating game uninspired and just smears the name of the series that sells the most in the industry today.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Cheat Code Central,20,Mistmare has more bugs than an apartment in the Projects. The game is virtually unplayable. Its more horrendous than the Inquisition - and just about as much fun. I dont even know where to begin to lament on the inadequacies of this… abomination.
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,GamerWeb Nintendo,20,A game that shatters expectations but in the worst conceivable manner. What we have here is a game so awful that it truly is in a class all by itself. Its just mind boggling how bad this game is.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Gamestyle,30,In the end it proves too bland and generic for mech enthusiasts and just a poor game for the uninitiated.
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,Console Monster,30,Overall Megamind: Ultimate Showdown is a fairly poor game. The lack of anything innovative makes it just like the other movie-based games currently on the market. This is only one to purchase if youre an achievement junkie and even they might think twice.
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,GameSpot,30,Youll have more fun laughing at this light-gun shooter than playing it.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Play (Poland),30,He can fly! And thatd be about it - Iron Man cant jump climb the ladder or pick any Goddamned thing. When the novelty of flying wears off all that remains is a very disappointing shooter lacking any challenge. Oh and I saw much prettier games on PlayStation 2. [July 2008]
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Exceptionally poor: we imagine Bruce is rolling in his grave right now. [Oct 2002 p.109]
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,God is a Geek,30,Rekoil is a banal title with poorly implemented features confusing UI and ugly aesthetics. I can appreciate what Plastic Piranha tried to do but sadly they have failed to deliver on promises of balanced competitive gameplay – and even on some of the basic core mechanics of a competent FPS.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,Worth Playing,30,Zombeer is bad. The humor is scattershot and groan-inducing while the gameplay is barely functional.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,IGN,20,I can understand trying to do a budget version of volleyball but when 8-bit versions of the sport actually offer more fun (and maybe even look better) theres quite literally zero reason to take a look at the game.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,Its neither run nor funny - youre better off spending $20 on something else. [Jan 2004 p.125]
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,COGconnected,30,Going into Weeping Doll I was hoping to experience a horror game in the glory that is VR. Sadly Weeping Doll didn’t deliver much of anything except a simple puzzle solving game that feels undercooked.
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Yahoo!,20,A mess of a game. Its not even a game more like a slow rotting death. No matter how great your love for George Romero no matter how overpowering your curiosity there is no reason to look twice at Land of the Dead. Do not walk away. Run.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,God is a Geek,20,You really shouldn’t play Escape Dead Island. It isn’t fun and the only real redeeming feature is that it is technically playable.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,Games Master UK,29,Possibly the worst blotch on Sonics record. [Feb 2015 p.73]
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,4Players.de,30,That this cover shooter took a lot of inspiration from Gears of War isn’t a bad thing. At least if you compared it to the poor visuals the thin sound and the abysmal English localization that takes it far beyond trash.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,TheSixthAxis,30,Its dated looks slippery controls and occasional bugs don’t exactly help but the lack of originality compared to both Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams and Speedrunners just highlight the problems with this copy and paste effort. Go play Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams instead of this.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,GameZone,25,There’s very little here to challenge a first grader and the memory games are just way too insulting. Brain Age still the intelligent choice so avoid this one at all costs.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Games.cz,30,An interesting concept thats been realised into a totally horrible and dull shooter/stealth action crossover that I cannot recommend to fans of the series not even to fans of the Walking Dead comics. The only noticeable positive about it is its voice acting.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,G4 TV,20,The single-player mode is a painful and sometimes laughable experience. Multiplayer fares much better provided you can find people to play with online but there are much better titles out there to choose from.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Hyper Magazine,30,This is worthless rote action done much better elsewhere. [Nov 2012 p.78]
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,Eurogamer,20,This game gets a low score because there is no point to it.
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Game Revolution,25,Controls rather your body is wonky.
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,1UP,30,The problem is that it plays like Tony Hawks 1999 debut. Worse yet its not even on par with that.
Coliseum,PC,Jan-6-2004,Stormcloud Creations,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing,PC Gamer,37,This game got repetitious after about 15 minutes and downright treadmill-like within a half-hour. The emperors verdict: Thumb down. [May 2004 p.71]
Kabuki Warriors,Xbox,Nov-19-2001,Light Weight,Action | Fighting | 2D,Electronic Gaming Monthly,25,Mind-boggling travesty. [Jan 2002 p.231]
Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,MEGamers,22,Everything you can think of is wrongfully done in this game.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Hardcore Gamer,20,Like Birdemic or The Room Magus is so terrible that it can only be called a masterpiece.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,XboxAddict,25,I don’t particularly like pointing out so many negatives but when there’s virtually no positives to speak about it’s difficult not to. A nonexistent storyline basic and repetitive gameplay terrible and constant one-liners and nothing that makes it feel like a real Ghostbusters experience makes this game a difficult sell at $20 but it’s price is unfathomably three times that amount.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Total Video Games,30,I’m not sure why this game was ever made.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Slant Magazine,30,Robomodos Activision-mandated update most often challenges players strangely not to score big but stupidly.
Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,29,Not worth the time of you or your child.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,Destructoid,25,Does little to elevate itself over the antiquated genre it spawned from. The hand-drawn 2D art is nice and the real-world caricatures that act as bosses after each stage might elicit a smirk but the game is short shallow and unable to properly execute the simple tried-and-true beat em up gameplay style let alone advance it.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,CD-Action,30,You cant come up with an idea for an interesting varied gameplay your budget is very limited and your breathtaking script is being digested by a dog? Dont worry – just make another mediocre zombie game and publish it on Steam. Someone will buy it. [September 2011 p.73]
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,Take the thing online (that is the name of the game after all...) and the results are truly beyond atrocious. [Issue#33 p.116]
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,SpazioGames,40,Infinity Runner is a failure from every point of view. Born as a PC game and also available on PS4 it hasnt definitely found its place in the market.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,40,Slot car racing is bloody boring enough without have to replicate it in a videogame. Whats next? Snail racing?... It stinks.
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gaming Age,33,If you’re the sort of person who enjoys aimless wandering but doesn’t like the idea of getting up off the couch and actually doing it then you might be in luck here. Otherwise don’t bother because it’s absolutely not worth it.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Digital Entertainment News,40,Nuclear holocaust survivors in a post-apocalyptic world filled with people wearing clown masks may find Hard Truck: Apocalypse to be an effective training tool but anyone looking for a good game should look elsewhere.
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,GamesRadar+,30,Realistic? Yes. Fun? Not one bit. Whats worse is that you have to sit and listen to the other fake players talk smack at the tables with the same four lines of speech. Youll be wise to quickly run to the Options menu and turn the sound off.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GameWatcher,30,Theres precious little to recommend here outside of the occasionally cutesy over-sexed anime visuals and comedy wobbling breasts.
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Digitally Downloaded,40,As a demo it actually works; when I played it for ten minutes in a controlled environment last year I came away quite impressed with it. But those first ten minutes are Bravo Teams limit and Sony should have realised this and pulled the plug on the project as a commercial game a long time ago.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendo Enthusiast,40,If you are a huge fan of NiGHTS it’s worth picking up at a discounted price because there is some fun to be had here: just the fun moments are few and far between.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,My advice to the developers is next time skip the shaking the timers and the laughable cinemas and spend more time polishing and testing. [June 2005 p.101]
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,GamerFeed,40,This game certainly has some really great graphics and animations but it comes up short on being able to keep things moving at an enjoyable pace not to mention that its very difficult to control.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,Play Magazine,40,Doesnt anyone anywhere give a rats ass about this franchise anymore? [Aug 2002 p.76]
Shadow the Hedgehog,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2005,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamePro,40,For all the consternation about a gun-toting enigma invading a kid-friendly video-game series the only thing to fear in Segas Shadow the Hedgehog is the games slap-dash excution. [Mar 2006 p.80]
Crash: Mind Over Mutant,DS,Oct-7-2008,TOSE,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,40,Crash: Mind Over Mutant is a competent platformer. While it leaves much to be desired in terms of depth and level design fans of the titular Bandicoot or starved DS platform lovers may enjoy it. Others should pass this one by.
Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Gamer UK,22,This cheap tacky space combat sim is a stinking mess insulting the name of the series merely by presuming to associate itself with it. [Mar 2008 p.83]
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cubed3,40,Rodea the Sky Soldier is simply a game that really needed more time and a course correction. A lot of promising concepts are seen and experienced throughout but the flying and Sonic homing-style combat would have been executed so much better with a bit more polish.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,GameOver.gr,40,It may be surprisingly faithful to the original transcripts even if it gives very little information regarding the Trojan War but that is the only positive aspect of this new western oriented button masher from Koei. This recreation of Homers Epic is extremely shallow and repetitive offering nothing new to the genre.
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,IGN,35,But its worthless and Eidos knows it. The game design is so transparent the goal behind the game is so obvious the lack of any morsel of fun is so far from the car and tracks and the playing of it…its just exasperating. This is pure bargain bin trash.
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,TeamXbox,38,While the story had potential for creating a cool juncture between history and science fiction there’s very little flexing of those muscles in the actual product.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Edge Magazine,30,Plays unbearably clumsily. [June 2010 p.104]
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,CPUGamer,30,Bottom line is that on paper this is an incredibly deep and varied game but time and again the reach of the programmers vastly exceeds their grasp. Even months after release theres so little in this game thats working as intended that only the most desperate die-hard fan of the genre should even consider this game.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,G4 TV,40,The tiny blocky graphics do little to immerse you into the park and the unwieldy controls make relatively simple actions needlessly difficult.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,Second-rate action game is boring for comic devotees and too easy for fighting game fans. Voice cast from the original movie actors can not change anything of this. [Oct 2009]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Hardcore Gamer,40,The end result is a cluttered mess that constantly tries to keep you active with something anything at random in order to distract you from the poor design.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Deeko,40,The gameplay is lackluster the musical track is enough to make you fall asleep and the voice acting is so bad that you can’t help but weep.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Electronic Gaming Monthly,35,Its not as mind-blowingly awful as the old N64 Superman stinker but it is outclassed by nearly every other comic-book game out there. [Feb 2003 p.154]
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,GameSpot,38,National Hockey Nights graphics are solid but its no-frills gameplay modes and abysmal control leech the fun from the game leaving a superficial shell behind.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,1UP,42,As a stand-alone download its a short rendition of the Watchmen brawler experience that features more low points than high points -- but with an admittedly awesome moment of Rorschach punching a fat pervert.
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Worth Playing,40,If you like racing games play Forza Burnout or Gran Turismo. If you are someone who likes Hummer vehicles go and play Mercenaries to see how it should handle.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Play Magazine,35,Its hard to find the fun in Mutant Melee whether playing alone or with friends. [May 2005 p.54]
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,RPGamer,30,Although the combat system is unique the progressively easy difficulty atrocious story and subpar visuals make Last Rebellion difficult to recommend. Its also incredibly short requiring less than fifteen hours to complete the game.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Push Square,30,Chronovolt is a glitchy and unsatisfying title thats hard to recommend. While you may glean some enjoyment from its opening moments the novelty swiftly wears thin. This title is best rolled out of sight and into obscurity.
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameShark,33,However Mr. Whites wild ride isnt the only thing included in this package – there are also a few new schematics for making new weapons. These can be accessed in the regular game as well as the DLC. This is a cool feature if youre new to Dead Island or are on a new playthrough but theres not really enough there to warrant paying for the DLC. Dead Island is still a game that deserves to be played if you missed it last year – but Ryder White can be safely skipped.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Yahoo!,40,Talking of light there are several periods playing as Rick that youll be inching forward down rocky tunnels with virtually no illumination to help you and the 3D map that you can cut to when youre feeling lost is worse than useless.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Computer Games Magazine,30,Flaws like this keep State of Emergency 2 from being anything more than a straightforward third-person shooting gallery. [Jun 2006 p.92]
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,TheSixthAxis,40,With unenjoyable and clunky combat that is made much worse during the 3D segments a laughably archetypal fantasy story and dated character models it’s hard to actually believe that AeternoBlade II released this year for modern consoles. AeternoBlade II simply falls short of all of its ambitions whatever they might have been.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,Nintendo Insider,40,The end result is that Fimbul is a soulless experience that never amounts to much more than something that will forever represent the developer’s unrealized vision. Throwing the unpredictable bugs glitches and wayward problems that are present on Nintendo Switch into consideration it’s hard to not come to the conclusion that you’d be better off simply leaving it to someone else to prevent Ragnarök from happening.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,40,A game destined for the chopping block. [Summer 2009 p.78]
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Vandal,38,MotoGP is one of the most popular titles in the driving panorama however this Wii version hasnt been as lucky as the ones in PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This is a lackluster product which could have hit the billboards.
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Pocket Gamer UK,40,Quantity over quality this suite of gambling games fails to capture the thrill of throwing all your money away on the single spin of a wheel.
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Destructoid,30,It doesnt feel like much love went into this project in almost every aspect. Its probably the best game in the Bubsy franchise (not saying much) but also lacks some of the few things that really gave Bubsy any definition at all. It just feels like a random platformer with Bubsy plastered all over it because hey remember him? Oh also its thirty dollars. In a year that has brought us a bevvy of amazing platformers some even revitalizing long-dormant series Bubsy is easily left behind.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GamePro,40,Theres no exclusive content just a new way to struggle with already poor combat.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GameSpot,40,An inferior copy of a classic Swashbucklers isnt worth your time.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,Totally360,40,A minor distraction perhaps but classic is reserved for titles that carry fond memories and are still as satisfying to play as they ever were and Discs of Tron just doesn’t fit that description at all.
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,Worth Playing,40,Not only is this game absolutely atrocious but you generally dont want to give a machine a reason to hate you.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Play Magazine,20,Foist this game on a hated enemy; its surprising a bomb this big doesnt come ticking. [Oct 2005 p.70]
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Play.tm,35,Personally I get a similar amount of pleasure from cleaning the oven or mowing the lawn both of which I can do for free and both of which provide some tangible benefit when Im done rather than just making my thumbs hurt.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,36,What a stinker. [Aug 2008 p.101]
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,Jolt Online Gaming UK,35,The limited gameplay with an atmosphere that is completely spoiled by some deviously frustrating design and lazy pathing leads to an experience that for most will be flat and lifeless.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,COGconnected,30,There is no question Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark plays and feels like your typical movie tie-in game. Everything about it screams ‘rushed out the door’ to satisfy the needs of all those poor suckers who wasted money watching the big screen stinker.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,IGN,38,If youre looking for a rewarding block-dropping experience however save yourself the thirty-five bucks and pick up a portable version. Chances are itll be cheaper more fun and less inclined to promote suicidal megalomania.
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GamerWeb Sega,44,Its a damned shame but theres just about no good reason to bring this game into your life.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,35,Not being able to reliably move in diagonal directions makes certain levels near impossible. Q*Bert deserves better.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Games Master UK,30,The characters filling out the world are frankly insultingly stupid and voiced so badly it wouldnt have even been funny in the 90s.[Nov 2014 p.79]
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,TeamXbox,40,The gameplay is horribly repetitive and dull the controls are twitchy the visuals are bland and the audio is laughable.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Nintendo Power,30,Suffers from one of the worst cameras in recent memory killer slowdown and bland levels rife with invisible barriers. [Feb 2006 p.97]
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,33,Tyranna-bore-us Rex. Triceraplops.Velocicraptor. You get the picture.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,Areajugones,30,HUSK is full of technical issues and bugs that affect the progress of the story. Great setting but very poor execution. Unplayable.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,IGN,23,Its only arguably redeeming quality is the way it caters to the same kind of morbid fascination that drives kids to rip the wings off of butterflies or have catered Justin Bieber parties. And if theres any justice in this industry at all that one strength will not be enough to save this dreck from the bowels of the bargain bin.
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,SpazioGames,40,If a product wants to bring our memories back to when videogames were just lines and beeps it must offer something to still keep us entertained in 2012. Johnny Kung Fu just doesnt have what it takes. There are a way better options for that price in the e-shop. Dont waste your time with this.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,GameFocus,38,Mahjong has been strangely missing from the XBLA. Unfortunately FunTown Mahjong is simply not good enough to fill that niche. Its sloppy presentation is its ultimate downfall from the terrible tutorial to the awful audio-visual.
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,36,Frustrating cheap and lacking any real depth. A modern Chase HQ this isnt. [Aug 2008 p.80]
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,1UP,40,Unleashed isnt completely without merit -- it just falls far below any reasonable standard for fighting wrestling or monster games.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,40,Ubisoft Shanghai and Tiwak did a magnificent job of butchering the reimagining of a classic tale and providing plenty of disposable derivative gameplay to go along with it.
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GameSpot,33,Unless youre looking for some laughs or a trip down memory lane stay far far away from this one.
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,Your magnetic skis do more than just hug the rails when you’re grinding along – they magically suck you toward rails if you’re in the vicinity. It’s ridiculous. [Mar 2002 p.108]
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Eurogamer,40,There is a place for more substantial 3D games like this on the platform but Street Trace: NYC provides nothing to recommend itself over the slew of more tightly focussed and expressed rivals on the platform.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,IGN,37,Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is a very bad game on the PlayStation 2. Its terrible from a technical standpoint and nothing else about its design really brings it out of the gutter.
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,PlayStation Universe,35,There’s little value and almost no substance in Harmonix Music VR. Its drab modes and environments fail to add anything interesting to the music listening experience.
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,My Gamer,34,There’s no tutorial to ease you into the game the manual is overly cryptic there’s no adjustable difficulty level and combat seems almost intentionally tedious.
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpot,35,This archaic first-person shooter is lousy to its core.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN,40,The developers should have just stuck with the tried-and-true 2D Prince of Persia-style of the previous Oddworld games for this conversion. Munchs Oddysee is full of little quirks that add up to a very un-fun GBA game that cant even fall back on technical merits.
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,GameSpy,33,A bad adventure game based on far better books. Go read them.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,1UP,33,A by-the-numbers affair unlikely to rouse most action fans. Maybe you wont toss your controller in a fit of rage (unlike the frustrating PS3/360 games) but with gameplay and presentation this uninteresting do you even need pick it up to begin with?
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,40,The Falsebound Kingdom is almost a prophetic title as this inferior product is forced upon the multitude of loyal supporters that are blind to the deception and exploitation employed by the Yu-Gi-Oh Empire.
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,GameZone,38,Gruesome and indescribably disappointing.
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Maxim Online,40,There’s no ear biting in Tyson’s animated repertoire (damn!) but there’re plenty of other ways to rearrange your opponent’s face—even though you won’t recognize any of them.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Official Xbox Magazine,30,If youre not gnashing your teeth trying to make Totem Ball work then youre gritting them in pain because your arms are killing you. [Holiday 2006 p.80]
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Electronic Gaming Monthly,39,That its online component is limited to a linear and moderately laggy co-op mode - and therefore feels even more ponderous than the single-player game - does little to spirit this comic book tie-in from gaming purgatory. [July 2008 p.80]
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,Cubed3,20,The idea of implementing roguelike elements and endless game design in old-school survival horror has potential but Vaccine fails to capitalise on it. Aspects where the developers could have improved on were perks that could allow a 180-degree turn a map system or even a combo system where it can be possible to earn back extra time like Resident Evils The Mercenaries mode. With much more variety in level design and more enemies Vaccine could have been an interesting guilty pleasure. In its current state this seems more like pre-alpha build with many of the features not yet implemented.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,PC Gamer,40,Occasionally entertaining but plagued by AI bugs and hamstrung by a clunky user interface. Less than the sum of its parts.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Essentially the only thing that kept us playing the campaign mode was to escape the horrible rap metal in the menu screens. [Mar 2009 p.83]
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,n-Revolution Magazine UK,40,If Iron Man Wii looked better and played smoother it would at least be bearable. But it doesnt and it isnt. [Issue#23 p.62]
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,Seems to have sprung up from the sharp minds of bored high school students who probably spent too much time playing Gauntlet. [Winter 2002 p.109]
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,SpazioGames,40,Few tracks few cars little fun. Ridge Racer is an ugly demo sold at thirty euro with the amazing idea of expanding the game content through DLC.
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Theres an element of novelty in the first few minutes of play but it doesnt last long. It isnt even the sketchy gameplay that sinks this Battleship – its the abhorrently commercial objective apparent in every second of rushed gameplay. Theres no artistic vision here and the original idea at its core hasnt been given the time and love needed to build a coherent or enjoyable game.
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer UK,38,Well and truly eclipsed by the passage of RTS history. [Feb 2008 p.79]
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,TheSixthAxis,30,Submersed takes an interesting and original premise and does virtually nothing good with it. There are elements and ideas of a good game in the bare bones of this but it is all so poorly executed and dull that it is difficult to recommend. The fact that it is a mid-price game on PS4 only compounds this amateur feel as there are hundreds of similar games available on Steam for a couple of quid. In the end this is far more snores than Jaws and lacks any real bite.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,SpazioGames,35,A complete waste of good ideas. Theres really no reason why you should bother buying this mess.
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Any Temple Run player will be familiar with the basic premise and Infinity Runner does little to shake things up – instead delivering trial-and-error gameplay dodgy production values and repeated.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,RealGamer,40,But sadly Ride simply lacks the same quality providing and unimaginative playing experience that never seems to get out of the blocks and you may feel you’ve being taken for a ride with this game especially considering its price!
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,XGP Gaming,32,From the lackluster graphics to the terrible enemy AI the crappy single-player and the generic online play this game doesnt offer anything you havent seen before.
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpy,33,Its poorly designed poorly executed and downright frustrating to play.
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,G4 TV,40,Compared to the numerous improvements and mini-games in the incredibly playable Tony Hawks Pro Skater 4 Evolution Skateboarding feels as if it were already on the brink of extinction.
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,PC Gamer,35,After just a half-hour SLC 2002 will be straight in the trash. Its a mathematical certainty. [May 2002 p.77]
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,We Got This Covered,30,An excellent noir aesthetic doesnt save Calvino Noir from its utterly incompetent and buggy gameplay making for an infuriating stealth title.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,DarkZero,30,Tornado is a title that started with a solid base of fun gameplay mechanics and interesting level design and then buried it under a mound of inexplicably terrible design faults that seem like they were created to generate annoyance.
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,Play (Poland),30,Forsaken gods? Rather forsaken legacy and a blatant ripoff. After two years of development we receive a game with a plethora of bugs jerky graphics and frequent crashes to the desktop a game that strips this franchise of the pitiful remains of its former glory. [Jan 2009]
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GamingTrend,30,There is very little fun to be had in MilitAnt. After spending most of my time breezing through half of the game’s bosses all but submitting to the other half (with a pair of very green exceptions) and rushing past nearly every basic enemy I get the impression that this ubiquitous imbalance in difficulty is more likely a vast oversight than a design choice.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Destructoid,35,Ultimately Pirates Vs. Ninja Dodgeball is a waste of time.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Cheat Code Central,40,Un-challenging un-fun easy to beat and way too short. It’s such a boring game that the only saving grace is that it’s mercifully short.
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Cheat Code Central,40,This game is more of an action adventure without the combat. Its also a little shy on action and adventure.
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpot,36,A smidgen of intellect surrounded by garbage does not make for a good game.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,We Got This Covered,30,Bombshell could have been a fine six-hour shooter but the unfulfilling fetch quests uninspired firearms and meddling glitches stretch the story until – like the game’s suicidal aliens – you too beg for death.
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,IGN Italia,40,A disappointing return to WWII with sub-par artificial intelligence limited multiplayer support and several annoying bugs.
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,Gaming Age,33,As a movie game goes it could have been pretty decent if there was a larger variety of enemies and of course the game was about 4 times the length. As is we have another movie licensed game that fails to deliver the goods.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Eurogamer,30,If Churchill had died we might all be speaking German but at least we wouldnt have to put up with nonsense like this.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,35,Its numerous bugs and linear missions make it frustrating to play and the story never grabs you like a good sci-fi adventure should. Even the most devoted of Star Trek fans will be hard pressed to find something to like in Star Trek The Video Game: there are simply too many glaring problems.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,IGN,32,Big breasts can go a long way to brightening up any day but with gameplay this dim even these headlights cant light up this game.
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,GamesRadar+,30,See as the puzzles get bigger youre actually forced to scroll them onto the screen which will slow you down even more. Save your $10 for something more worthwhile. This isnt even a decent time-waster.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,NintendoWorldReport,35,With just five hours on the counter barely anything gets time to truly sink in. Add to this the technical issues and the inconsistencies of the presentation and you have a game that could have benefited from a bit more playtesting.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,PC Invasion,30,This game fails at almost everything it sets out to do. With janky animations embarrassing story awful combat mechanics and horrible enemy layouts and AI theres just not much positive to say about it.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,It’s an awkward mix of Diablo and Soul Reaver that nobody asked for. Something to play if you’ve got a few hours and an itch to bump up your Gamerscore.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,PSM Magazine,40,The game offers nothing but tedium to older gamers but the six and under crowd may love it. [Nov 2007 p.90]
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,Video Game Talk,40,If you have a kid and are already planning a trip to Six Flags this is a solid pick-up as this $25 game has a $30 kids admission voucher in it (if you go before the end of 2009) so its basically like getting the game for free. Just be prepared to hear complaints from a soon-to-be bored child a few days after purchase.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,39,A game without a reason to live consigned to the scrapheap by the 360s real racers. [July 2008 p.83]
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,40,Recycled environments mediocre gameplay and the absence of online play cripple this disappointing top-down adventure.
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,Gamers\' Temple,30,Skip this game and keep your fingers crossed that the next one will be better.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PSX Extreme,35,Quantum Theory is the epitome of awful game design. Uninspired. Underdeveloped. Gray. Some of the worst story telling this generation has seen coupled with some of the worst visuals youll find on your beautiful PS3 or Xbox 360 in addition to level design thatll bore you the minute you lay your eyes on it.
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,30,Even if John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland worked perfectly it would be an uninspired unattractive game that beats the player over the head with its sponsor.
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,TeamXbox,38,Just be prepared for a game that screams I’m simple (as in I’m mediocre not I’m elegantly designed).
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GRYOnline.pl,35,If you like Harry Potter - dont buy this game. If you like TPP shooters - stay away from this game. If you like good music - buy yourself the official movie soundtrack. If youre the parents of a young teenager - choose anything but this game. Youll hurt your child with it. Dont buy this game because you are voting with your wallet. By paying for this game you allow more of THAT to be developed in the future.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,TheSixthAxis,40,If you’re simply looking to play Career Mode on the go then you may get some mileage out of FIFA 20 Legacy Edition on Switch but if you can buy FIFA on any other platform then we suggest you do. The Switchs FIFA legacy is fast becoming outdated gameplay and missing features and the only way to put a stop to this is to vote with your wallet.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,1UP,40,This game attempts to combine the best aspects of serious tactical shooters like Flashpoint with the run-and-gun action of the Battlefield series but does neither very well. [40 = original score]
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,GameGrin,40,There’s a core gameplay loop that could have some substance but it’s surrounded by a confused interface a simply awful tutorial with surface-level complexity that needn’t exist.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,GameStar,33,I have to kill everbody. It works but its a primitive piece of garbage. Its so bad its almost funny.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Boomtown,30,Yet another poor incarnation of a movie (which didn’t do that great anyway) which doesn’t accomplish anything other than giving the player consistent headaches throughout. Blame it on its poor level design repetitive gameplay constant bugs or whatever you like as there are ample pickings.
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,GamingTrend,35,Between fumbling through the menus mashing your way to a choppy and exceedingly easy victory and clicking through meandering dialogue scenes that hold no weight you’ll find yourself too bored to actually collect all the parts you want to make your perfect Gundam. If you’re itching to fight big robots play Gundam Versus instead. Or go punch that actual Gundam in Japan (don’t do that).
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,AceGamez,40,PDC World Championship Darts 2008 is a game that really has no reason to exist.
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,PSM3 Magazine UK,40,A wasted opportunity to show off Move control. [Sept 2011 p.102]
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,40,The game isnt especially good and I cant recommend it. The developer successfully made a game about summer chores feel like a chore but I dont know if that was the point.
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpot,33,Final Fight: Streetwise doesnt look good doesnt play well and it cant even get its unlockable bonus--the original arcade game--right.
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,RewiredMind,30,To me I wouldn’t even leave this game in the basement as you never know who may find it.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,NintendoWorldReport,40,The Elder Scrolls: Blades is a simple case of a mediocre game on mobile just not holding up on an actual console. Concessions made for mobile play just don’t make sense here. Not to mention when blown up to a TV or even the modest size of the Switch’s screen Blades is pretty ugly. Its a downright joke when compared to the actual full Elder Scrolls game already available on the platform. Unlike other Bethesda mobile offerings like Fallout Shelter Blades is a simplification of a complex game rather than a game built with mobile limitations in mind. When you take away the reason for those limitations you’re left with an ugly mess of a game with nothing to justify its own existence.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Games Master UK,40,A party without fun is merely a gathering. Played alone this is a bit of a disaster. [Apr 2012 p.96]
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,PS3bloggen.se,30,Despite the fact that the game is based on a bad movie Double Helix have managed to create a game thats even worse. The graphics and controls go head to head to see whos the worst but to be honest they both equally awful.
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,Pure Magazine UK,40,Possibly the lowest point in Sonic gaming sloppy camera and terrible level design let this down badly. [Mar 2007 p.53]
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,PlayStation Universe,35,Falling short in just about every way a title of this ilk can everything Super Dungeon Bros attempts to do the three year old Diablo III does better. Avoid.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,GameWatcher,40,I tested the Xbox 360 version of Omerta which controlled fine. The 360 versions of Tropico both had decent performance and the same is true here. As well as working smoothly on a technical level the actual control scheme is well-thought out. It’s clear that Omerta began life with both platforms in mind instead of console being tacked on as an after-thought.
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,30,It lacks features and control. All you really do is make a few choices and let the game play it all out for you. Its like the battle system in an old-school RPG.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Game Revolution,25,If anyone should avoid this game it should be the hardcore ECW fan as they will be the most outraged.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,An amazing new low for platforming games. [Christmas 2009 p.102]
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,GamesRadar+,40,Ninja Gaiden Z is a disappointing entry in the Ninja Gaiden series filled with repetitive enemy encounters cringeworthy pervy jokes and frustrating unbalanced gameplay. This is not the ninja game youre looking for.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,TeamXbox,40,A breakdown of the core gameplay mechanic will haunt players early and often in America’s Army: True Soldiers.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameWatcher,35,For fans of gaming stay well clear. Even as far as movie-tie-ins go this title is the biggest crime to the Harry Potter franchise since Emma Watson decided looking like a public schoolboy is sexy.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PALGN,40,Not even the most dedicated fans of the movie will find this game to be of any interest. Childrens game or not The Golden Compass is well below par and not worth your money.
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Electronic Gaming Monthly,31,This is a weak port that doesnt do Myst justice; its not worth a revisit even for nostalgia. [June 2008 p.87]
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,Gameblog.fr,40,A game with a lot of sexy fan service and good graphism but a real lack of action based content that force you to farm to get all the swimsuits.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,Destructoid,30,As it stands you should absolutely hold off on Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality for PlayStation VR until the controls are overhauled in the planned update. I ended up having some fun once I learned how to work around those glaring issues to a certain extent but even in the best of times it was a struggle. Its a shame the launch went this way because theres an entertaining VR experience buried in here.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Games Radar,0,Dull unenjoyable and incredibly shoddy failing to deliver even the most basic of racing thrills.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,TotalGames.net,33,The controls are pretty lousy characters will often merge with each other and scenery and moves feel limited; plus why cant we grapple an opponent when theyre stunned?...Avoid this rubbish at all costs.
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,TheXboxHub,30,I was hoping to be blown away by Dead Alliance but a dwindling player base poor gameplay terrible bugs and a lack of content make this just another disappointment within a once great genre.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,Computer and Video Games,40,While the game boasts an impressive array of hardware youre sadly only allowed to play as the forces of the right and just in a linear two-pronged campaign that starts with the US-led invasion of Afghanistan and finishes in Iraq.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Level7.nu,30,Even after more than seven years in development Aliens: Colonial Marines results in a cavalcade of shattered dreams and lost potential. Almost every element is either broken boring or badly designed and the once fearsome Xenomorphs are now reduced to mindless cannon fodder. To put it simply; its a terrible game.
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Sails beneath already low expectations. [Jan 2013 p.91]
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,InsideGamer.nl,40,Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Republic Heroes is not a great game full of bugs. The gameplay is very repetitive and is skipping once in a while often the camera isn’t positioned right and you can’t see were to go. But the ambiance and the story seem to fit the TV-series very well. Star Wars is one of my favourite film series ever and there are a lot of games out there but Republic Heroes is doing too much in a wrong way to get a positive grade.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,Gamer.nl,30,Once a great game in the arcade now not worth mentioning on Xbox Live Arcade. The controls are way too slow and inaccurate and everything feels so outdated. Not worth 400 points!

Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Nintendo Power,30,This dull clunky mess of a 3D beat-em-up suffers from sloppy hit detection brutal sllowdown and yawn-inducing levels that throw the same basic grunts at you over and over. [Dec. 2006 p.106]
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,Nintendo Life,30,Disappointing all over.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,40,A dull game that makes no use of the Wii U functionality. [Jan 2013 p.102]
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,34,With a gazillion top racers on 360 youd have to be bonkers to drive this home. [Feb 2008 p.79]
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,38,Not even cel-shaded reptiles can save a game cursed with tissue-thin design weak AI and repetitive gameplay. [June 2005 p.78]
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,30,After 20 minutes of gameplay you will have fully exhausted what the game has to show you.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,GameSpot,35,This frustrating collection of minigames is an insult to vacations holidays and every other blissful experience.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Hot Games,40,This game needed a hell of a lot more graphics optimization and a bit more work on the control would have been nice too.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Digital Spy,40,The storytelling is sloppy the set-pieces are repetitive - and in some cases stolen from past games - while the visuals are dated. Its redeemed only by enjoyable third-person shooter action which comes alive in co-op multiplayer when theres no story holding players back.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Age,33,If this game had been free to play I probably would have dismissed many things and given it a higher score but at $8.99 this is one you can definitely skip.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,GameStar,37,It would be a quite decent theme park simulations if it werent for all those bugs crashes and a sub-par performance.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,IGN,35,A terribly executed arcade flight game.
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,games(TM),30,Occasionally playable but just mostly horrible. [Issue#108 p.116]
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,Nintendo Gamer,20,It beggars belief then that someone would consciously make a game that contained only the worst bits of an already atrocious game. [Mar 2010 p.75]
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,GameSpot,40,The on-court action is so sloppy and unsatisfying that even rubbing defeat in Carmelo Anthonys face loses its appeal. NBA Live needs serious work in just about every aspect in order to raise its game to a respectable level.
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpot,40,Even though you can climb higher than ever before in Dynasty Warriors 6 the series as a whole seems stuck on the same wrung.
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,GamePro,30,The only thing that could have made this slapdash and sloppy game any weaker would have been to throw in Aquaman. [Apr 2004 p.86]
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Xbox Achievements,25,Avoid this game at all costs. Assuming you own a Kinect then you will have received a better compilation in the form of Kinect Adventures than anything this game has to offer.
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Totally360,30,What is most disappointing about Naughty Bear is that it had a good premise. This game could have been really awesome. Unfortunately this game was rushed out the door in an unfinished state.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameOver.gr,40,A missed chance in what could have been a cross between Indiana Jones and Uncharted in a first person shooter environment.
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Game Almighty,33,Straight up this game just isn’t fun. While it is fun to laugh at while others are playing it it only serves as a humiliation tool for others to mock you for playing. Just steer clear you’ll be a much happier person if you do.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,A pitiful tie-in to a sub-standard movie. [June 2011 p.111]
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,games(TM),30,With combat relying on clever use of items and plenty of RPG-esque searching and equipping Rengoku does show some potential but it’s far too little and with so many better-quality titles already on the market it’s definitely too late. [Mar 2006 p.116]
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,Patches may rescue this to some degree. For now it’s an unfinished game which should remain unpurchased by your wallet. [Issue#170 p.86]
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Game Over Online,30,The bottom line is the more I played Mindjack the more I wanted to stop playing Mindjack. I made it through to the end but it wasnt without a lot of head-scratching hair-pulling and obscenity-laced tirades.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Riot Pixels,35,Pixel-hunting for small barely noticeable items in dark rooms is a crappy idea for a horror game by itself but timer just adds insult to injury. And don’t bother suffering through this for the story because there is pretty much none of it.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameSpot,35,Although it features reasonably unique character designs interesting concepts and a huge explorable world Legend of Alon Dar fails in execution with substandard quality in nearly every respect.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Planet Dreamcast,40,Not an awful game. It just isnt a good game. It isnt anything. It feels like it happened by accident (an artist tripped and accidentally made a McGrath model).
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Destructoid,30,Maybe they did bite off more than they could chew but they at least had aspiration. None the less Veneticas over-ambition is its own downfall. The many imperfections that would be ironed out from larger more successful RPGs have not been attended to rendering the game as frustrating which is a pity.
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,Nintendojo,33,Romance Dawn is a misfire all around that only the absolute most completist of One Piece fans should give it a look. It’s a shame because One Piece is normally something quite wonderful. Such a waste.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GamerNode,25,This game is 2 inches deep and I found myself frustrated bored and maybe even a little angry at the problems with this game. Top this sundae of hate off with bland and boring music and youve got a solid reason to pass on this one at the game stores. Even in the bargain bin.
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,Gameplayer,30,This product is too crude for even the ‘mainstream’ demographic; it can only possibly appeal to the ignorant.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Eurogamer,40,With the mood alternating between boredom and exasperation Sanctum Of Slime is a spirit-crushing exercise that only a committed masochist could appreciate.
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer UK,35,An awful vision of strategys future. [May 2009 p.69]
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gaming Age,33,Overall other than maybe a rental or picking up one day in a bargain bin there is very little I can say to recommend this mediocre attempt with a big budget license.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Areajugones,30,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle features poor battles and a serious camera issues that erase the fun of the fights. Very few game modes and a dull story mode are the reason that this game is no good for any fan of this genre.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cheat Code Central,30,I would have had more fun gluing spray-painted macaroni to my ass than playing Mission Impossible: Operation Surma on the GBA.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,35,In short this game sucks dont buy it for yourself or anyone you love.
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,Adventure Gamers,40,While it remains an innovative and highly laudable idea which I hope will one day be put to better use in Jazz and Faust it fails to be more than a misguided gimmick. The ‘two adventures in one’ angle fails because even with this feature the game is extremely short.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,Eurogamer,30,As we perch on the cusp of a bold new console generation theres simply no justification for games this anaemic and sloppy especially at full price. Even in its best moments The Sopranos is dull shallow and repetitive - a game already five years past its sell-by date.
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpot,33,Final Fight: Streetwise doesnt look good doesnt play well and it cant even get its unlockable bonus--the original arcade game--right.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,32,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra The Video Game is just plain awful. Whatever you do though dont let me stop you from seeing the movie. Youll love it.
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,CD-Action,25,Sedna simply does not understand games from which it supposedly draws. [06/2018 p.77]
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Nintendo Gamer,34,A poorly designed game that allows you to create more poorly designed games then inflict them on other unfortunates. [June 2012 p.106]
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GameCritics,30,Time and Eternitys veneer is gorgeous but style doesnt trump substance—and the substance here leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Toki and Towa may love Zach the Alleged Protagonist but I sure dont.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,IGN,27,The simple truth is that the generic MC Groovz Dance Craze is a broken GameCube game. The dance work doesnt match with the music and therefore the titles dance challenges are not fun.
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Sweden,30,Bloodforge is a God of War for Xbox except that its not very good at all. Its a promising idea turned to nothing by too many mistakes.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,GamesRadar+,40,The art design is solid though technologically the graphics dont impress at all. At press-time the chat is nightmarish and the user interface a pale shadow of other MMOs well thought systems.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Nintendo Life,40,Contra: Rogue Corps has some good ideas. The twin-stick action could have worked if it hadn’t been so fussy and inaccurate the choice of characters could have been great if they’d had a bit more variety and the deep customisation and online game modes could have added longevity if they hadnt been attached to such a drab and messy-looking game. In the end nothing about this endeavour feels in any way related to the Contra games you know and love and you’d do much better to grab the Contra Anniversary Collection at a much lower price – or try out one of the many excellent retro twin-stick shooters or side-scrolling action games already available on the platform.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,LaPS4,38,Nickleodeon Kart Racers is another bad attempt after all that born covered under the idea of Mario Kart in this case this game has no ambition we got presented a boring dry game and the only people that could make this game fun are kids that don’t have Fortnite on their console.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,The A.V. Club,25,Spending a lot of time on a task can be satisfying but it doesn’t feel that way when the big payoff is delivering a missing piece of paper to complete a fetch quest. Instead the game manages to suck out all the wonder out of Coraline’s rich story and setting leaving only tedium behind.
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameBiz,36,It’s not a terribly good team-based strategy – in fact only if you’re a team-based strategy freak should you pick up this title as it offers very limited gameplay and extremely limited enjoyment as you struggle through the ongoing clobbering that Magnum Games likes to call missions.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,IGN,30,Clash of the Titans is the not only one of the worst license games Ive ever been tasked with reviewing but is also just an awful game in every sense you can think of. Its ugly as sin has terrible character animations and voice acting and feels like it should cost next to nothing as opposed to as much as a retail game.
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,Deeko,30,Brave: A Warriors Tale has done the almost impossible: surpassed Superman 64 for one of the worst games of all time.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Console Monster,30,She likened the game to the various dance routine videos she owns which I feel is a fitting comparison for Zumba Fitness for Kinect; a non-interactive set of dance routines where you try to replicate the on screen trainer with little to no feedback or interaction. Then again if you wanted a non-interactive dance routine video you could buy something like Carmen Electra Strip Aerobics and follow that instead of Zumba Fitnesss rainbow rhythms disco sensation.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,The guns are useless. [May 2008 p.112]
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,SpazioGames,30,Family Party: 30 Great Games on Nintendo Wii focuses the gameplay on the multiplayer component and offers 30 different challenges sorted by categories. Too bad it’s not funny and technically awful.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,NintendoWorldReport,30,With all its problems SPRay is a pretty terrible game. The basics of the gameplay are promising but it never becomes anything of substance. While the camera control is far and away the games worst problem it also suffers from lackluster puzzles bland combat and an awful overworld.
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,CD-Action,35,If it weren’t for the title related to a real submarine and the horrible tragedy of its crew no one would care about Kursk – and we would have missed absolutely nothing. It’s a dated terribly boring (both in terms of gameplay and the story) and generally poorly made game. [01/2019 p.54]
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Stevivor,35,A mish-mash of concepts and half-cooked ideas that are never fully developed wrapped up in a cutesy aesthetic that is at odds with its (at times) dark and disturbing themes. This is one to avoid.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,G4 TV,40,The missions feel boring and repetitive after a while and the combat is a mess. While the story is solid and the overall presentation of the game is pretty good the floundering gameplay manages to sink the entire fleet.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer UK,35,A startlingly awful interface. [June 2008 p.89]
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,IGN,30,Playing Rock Revolution is like getting kicked in the teeth and not in a rock n’ roll way. The cover songs are bad the gameplay is unintuitive and dull the options are extremely limited and the drum peripheral is horrid.
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Push Square,30,Sadly those looking for their MX vs. ATV fix are much better off waiting for Rainbow Studios to develop a new installment in this series specifically for the PS4.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,One day someone will nail this series and make a game that does its mystery characteristics justice but were stuck waiting until then. [Issue#66 p.91]
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Eurogamer,30,As interesting an idea as Sky Diving is sadly the concept fails to deliver thanks to clunky motion sensing.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,GameWatcher,30,A lazily cobbled-together bargain basement piece of shovelware that deserves neither your time or money.

ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,CNET Gamecenter,30,Insanely unoriginal environments and play options steal the horsepower from this all-terrain racer.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,31,Quite simply a rotten game with woefully little variation in gameplay and turgid mechanics. Theres very little fun here an dits cetainly a long way from cowabunga dude. [May 2007 p.78]
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,RPGamer,40,ArcaniA is just an altogether frustrating experience. Its few good points fail to shine through in any way thanks to the vast number of technical and design issues. Even a fun battle system cant do much for the game other than highlight even further the wasted potential.
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamesRadar+,30,Xiaolin Showdown is a bad game plain and simple. In a genre where speed and chaos is an important part of gameplay Xiaolin Showdown’s fights are out and outright tedious.
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,ZTGD,25,Tennis World Tour is a mess of a game. The AI is a joke that makes it too easy to beat the modes are lacking there are glitches galore and I honestly think the support for this game is not happening which means that online multiplayer may very well never come. If you’re looking for a Tennis game to sink time into I would say stick to something else. Anything else really. This one is not worth your time or your money.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Video Game Talk,40,The game feels unfinished and sloppy from start to finish with a terrible story to back it up and greatly varied presentational merits.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Computer Gaming World,30,This game just feels like an insult. Or maybe a practical joke. [Nov 2004 p.80]
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Armchair Empire,38,At a time where Star Trek is at its lowest popularity an abysmal game like this will not win over any new fans and is a horrid example of the Star Trek franchise.
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,Gamer.no,30,Rome wasnt built in a day but Iron Man 2 might have been. The game had potential but a rushed production and poor craftsmanship diminishes the joy of controlling Iron Man.
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,Play.tm,35,Ignoring as is really only fair the poor timing of its release theres still a multitude of reasons why you shouldnt spend your hard earned money on Winter Sports: The Next challenge 2009. Mow the lawn look at the lambs or just enjoy the extra daylight whatever you do with these warm spring days make sure its more enjoyable than playing this.

Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,All Game Guide,40,The manner in which the screen moves can actually make you sick and the enjoyment isnt enough to overcome that aspect.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,35,A poor-quality marketing tie-in. [July 2010 p.81]
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,games(TM),30,It’s hard to understand why the game exists. Did Gaiman desperately want to attach himself to an ugly boring puzzle game? Did the Odd Gentleman really think this was the best way to display his work? It’s more of a mystery than the actual story of Wayward Manor itself.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GamePro,40,While many maps have some great design choices Things on Wheels feels like a dated and out of place title that may have been more accepted in the earlier stages of Microsofts Arcade platform.
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,Youll need to be a serious American football/robot fan to get stuck in now. [Dec 2007 p.96]

25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,1UP,30,Pandering to every college student and aspiring rap artists deep-seated Scarface fantasies 25 to Life is a 3D action-shooter that not only fails to innovate on any level but rolls back design and technological advancements to the early PSone era.
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,Games.cz,30,Setarrif ends as soon as it starts and that defines its final score. You play it for the sole purpose to finish it quickly. If we take its low difficulty and a lack of a great story then the quick finish is not a problem at all.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GamerNode,30,The original game was mediocre to begin with and the PSP version only serves to degrade what was already a less-than-enrapturing gameplay experience in a nearly direct port that suffers from a myriad of technical issues. Avoid.
Damnation,PC,May-22-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,34,A sad story. The game had an interesting concept and a good amount of potential but it just never came together.
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,DS,Jun-17-2008,Farmind Ltd,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,GamingExcellence,34,So go outside read a book or just pick your nose for a couple of hours. Wacky Races: Crash & Dash isn’t worth it.
One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,Push Square,30,Its a confounding mess of bright colours bizarre characters and unpleasant sights and sounds – but then again maybe thats entirely the point.

Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,1UP,33,Its the wide-ranging lack of polish that really damns Emergency Heroes to a forgettable existence as the player vehicles have all the floaty steering and shaky physics of a shovelware budget title (but with twice the price tag) and I even managed to crash the game by falling through the ground during one mission.
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,CD-Action,30,Instead of a breathtaking war spectacle it offers a half-baked puppet show that just cant fool anybody. [June 2012 p.75]
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,40,GT Pro Series has got decent cars and passable handling but the below average physics and utterly shameful visuals give this a cheap unfinished feel.

MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,XboxAddict,30,It wont take too long to unlock everything in the game and once youre done playing each event a few times theres very little reason to keep on playing unless you really want to move up the leaderboards by beating scores.

The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameDaily,30,The camera moves about uncontrollably making it hard to navigate certain areas or get a lock on enemies. Do not walk in this games direction.
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Worth Playing,30,Gungrave VR is a game that not only tarnishes its own legacy but also leaves a bad impression of VR as a whole. The gameplay is shallow as attacks feel slow and lack any sort of impact. The limited nature of the stages and the lack of any intelligent enemy combat makes the affair boring but the clunky implementation of VR is what really drags down the game. The VR feels unnatural and it doesnt safeguard one from getting nausea. Theres still hope that the upcoming sequel will fare better especially if it sticks with more traditional gameplay elements and presentation but this VR take is one that players can easily skip.

Seduce Me,PC,Jan-2-2013,None,Strategy | General | General,Vandal,40,The last thing we will do in Seduce Me is seduce someone. This is a card game that will show us naked ladies but theres little value to our actions or decisions.

Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,XGN,30,Dragons Lair is not the game youre looking for on Xbox Live. The controls dont work well and you dont need a lot of time to beat the entire game. So leave your sword where it is because Dragons Lair doesnt ever make you feel like a knight.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Gamer.tv,40,Overall it seems like the production attitude was to quote the Simon Cowell-managed Westlife Hey whatever. A very poor cash-in and one to avoid.

007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gameplanet,35,A clear attempt to cash in on 49 years of Bond goodwill and the gaming ignorance of many of the Christmas-present-buying public 007 Legends is a game that belongs in the previous generation but even then it would have been tough to recommend.

Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,30,One of the worst games this year so far - a soulless movie tie-in with a broken control scheme crappy graphics repetitive missions and a terrible story. Just stay away from this heap of rusty scrap metal and go see the movie instead.
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,PSX-Sense.nl,35,A great concept does not automatically make for a great videogame especially when the execution is this lacklustre. In this case the repetitive gameplay long loading times and awful graphics are the main detractors. The intriguing multiplayer set-up couldve been a saving grace but is ultimately hampered by a severe lack of players. Shame.

Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Game World Navigator Magazine,37,Biggest problem of AG isn’t the story or lackluster graphics but its incredibly poor AI. Should you cause an alarm every guard on the level will blindly run to that spot letting you shoot them one by one without even changing position. At some point you start to wonder – why bother trying to stealth around if it’s so much easier to just kill everyone? [Issue#209 p.63]
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,GameZone,31,There is nothing in this game that represents fun. I hate to say that but when all the members of the house give it a try and no one could say anything good about it well that just seals the deal.
The Polar Express,GameCube,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,31,An ugly collection of poorly conceived minigames The Polar Express is a failure by the standards of any medium.
Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,AceGamez,30,There arent any two player options and the main game is remarkably short. There isnt anything to make you want to play Around The World In 80 Days again particularly not the tedious and often frustrating gameplay.
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,PC Gameworld,33,The graphics are poor the gameplay boring and even Bruce Campbell can’t save the game. It’s not even worth it in the bargain-bin.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,ZTGD,40,A disappointment all around. Fans of the genre will scoff at the visuals and simplicity while more casual players will grow bored of its tedious missions and slow-paced gameplay.
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,GameStar,28,Quotation forthcoming.
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendophiles,32,The two-player mode adds no value to Space Raiders because there isn’t enough substance to the gameplay in the first place. There’s no sense of challenge and there is little fun since dodging and shooting at the same spot in a street is so undeveloped for games these days.
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,GameSpot,38,Its a collect-a-thon thats not so big not so deep and not so tall and its also devoid of the fun thats craved by all.
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,AllDreamcast,20,This is yet another insult to Dreamcast owners and no one should have to suffer through it. Ducati World Racing Challenge is racing at its absolute worst.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,Hardcore Gamer,30,Everything is just far too repetitive (not to mention tiring) to get folks through the campaign. A co-op mode didn’t even make it out in time for launch which could have at least added some reason to keep playing. Ace Banana may be technically sound but it’s plainly uninteresting when compared to the rest of PSVR’s launch lineup.
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,Jolt Online Gaming UK,35,You might be more interested to know what Driv3r isn’t though – a good game.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,Eurogamer,40,Charging 800 points for this when the aforementioned Castlevania: SotN comes at the same price is taking the proverbial. Steer well clear of this one.
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,GameZone,31,Utterly horrendous in every conceivable aspect.
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,20,There’s nothing to actually recommend about Chronus Arc. Fans of 16-bit and earlier JRPGs won’t get the nostalgic rush they might hope for from this game because it’s so artificially put together it feels more like an insult to the memory of those games than a celebration of them.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Worth Playing,40,Very little is enticing about Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DONT KNOW! outside of the license being used and even that isnt applied properly here.
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Eurogamer,30,Inevitably its the mini-games that really muff things up though.
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Metro GameCentral,30,Impossibly slow 2D shooter whose only worth is to prove what artistry goes into its betters.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Armchair Empire,30,Such is the nature of a bad game though; if its bad it would have always been and always will be bad.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Absolute Games,27,Zombies in jungle and abandoned temples – that’s a nice setup for a Left 4 Dead campaign. Unfortunately Rebellion is not Valve. Repeatedly press button on-screen to survive torture says a hint message during one of the interactive cutscenes. Oh I wish there was a button to erase Shellshock 2 from my memory.
Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,IGN,35,There is nothing good to say about Underground Pool. Everything about it is either frustrating boring or stupid.
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,39,Freedoms total lack of action is complemented by a complete absence of adventure leaving only bland graphics and a general sense of tedium to fill the giant void that exists between installing the game and finishing it.
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,IGN,37,With all of the gameplay here being decidedly sub-par the third volume should just scrap any remnants of gameplay and become one long non-interactive cutscene. Put it onto a DVD and charge fans of the show $10 to get more of their fix but for the love of that is good in gaming just dont make a game out of it.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Push Square,30,Its not entirely without entertainment value – kids will no doubt get a kick out of the license – but its longevity to even the most faithful followers is severely limited. Weve got no time for this adventure.
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Official Xbox Magazine,30,As a community we must save the children...from mediocre cartoon-based cideogame adaptations like this one! [Holiday 2006 p.76]
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Push Square,30,Nostalgia is a powerful thing – but in some cases it can be problematic. The industry has certainly moved on from the days when games such as Painkiller: Hell & Damnation were commonplace and while its not unreasonable to look back on these times with fondness that doesnt mean that this lazy rehash deserves your attention. This is a shining example of corner-cutting outdated ideas and in truth is a complete waste of your time.
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,Appalling textures clunky systems and gameplay you have to shake yourself away from. [Dec 2013 p.95]
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,Slant Magazine,30,The developer attempts to justify non sequiturs with a psychological narrative that distorts reality but the twists only become more and more meaningless as the escape progresses.
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Vandal,40,The art design is amazing but thats pretty much all that it is. Performance and gameplay issues prevent this game from being something much better.
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Destructoid,40,It can be fun but the pacing is annoying and the difficulty will frustrate all but the devoted.
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Eurogamer,30,505 Game Street has been commercially smart to jump aboard the Brain Training bandwagon quickly but it has made a huge mistake in throwing a faceless copycat effort out there. Hopefully people will not be remotely fooled - were certainly not.
MTV Sports: Skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald,PlayStation,Sep-12-2000,Darkblack,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Happy Puppy,30,Horrible control lousy graphics and a migraine-inducing frame rate all add up to one of the worst games on the market. If you want skateboarding action just stick to Tony Hawk.
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,GamesRadar+,30,If you dont care how broken and rudimentary this game is as long as its like the show youre going to be in a fury in no time.
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Gamer.no,30,Guns cars and zombies are apparently not enough. The lack of the all important fun factor ruins most of the fun you could have had running down zombies with your fancy muscle cars.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Play.tm,32,When the only reason youre compelled to continue playing a game is to point and laugh at how badly the entire thing has been thrown together you know that it has major problems.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GMR Magazine,40,Theres also a full set of uninteresting urban ethnic stereotypes rendered in starkly dated graphics and loudmouth fake gangsta sound bites. [Mar 2004 p.85]
Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu,Game Boy Advance,Nov-24-2003,Webfoot Technologies,Action | Fighting | 2D,Pocket Games,40,There are better fighting games out there for GBA even for hardcore fans of Dragon Ball Z. [Spring 2004 p.40]
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gameplanet,30,Add Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse to the list of licensed games that fail to deliver an experience that challenges entertains and stands apart from its source material.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,35,Even if you were completely charmed by Philip Pullmans work or enjoyed the movie adaptation theres absolutely no reason to give this game a try. Even the music as pretty as it is cant redeem such poor gameplay and atrocious presentation.
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,SpazioGames,30,Only an incurable dependence on third-person shooter will push you to buy this title. Move over. Seriously theres nothing here that can attract your interest.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,GameSpot,35,With deeply flawed motion controls and a number of other issues MotionSports fumbles all its potential.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,GameSpot,30,Dull repetitive and carelessly programmed dont even begin to sum up how crummy this action game based on the Looney Tunes license is.
Real Steel,Xbox 360,Oct-12-2011,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,IGN,30,A prime example of a film-to-game adaptation gone wrong. It perpetuates the stereotype that games based on movies arent good with a missed opportunity to use established mechanics effectively.
Soldier Elite,PC,May-29-2006,Metropolis Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,PC Format,32,Fill your house with treacle and grenades instead. Thats actually more fun. [Sept 2005 p.102]
Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,GameSpy,30,With apologies to The Little Mermaid perhaps third-person shooters arent one of those things thats much better down where its wetter under the sea.
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,games(TM),30,A lifeless carcass in the FPS mould lies in its wake. [Issue#109 p.104]
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,COGconnected,30,I was expecting (and hoping for) a spooky and atmospheric thrill ride but instead got an ill conceived and unpolished first person puzzle game. The story is weak the puzzles unintuitive and the experience wholly unsatisfying. Explorers would be better served travelling back in time and playing Myst or picking up one of the games I mentioned above. Steer clear of this one.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,1UP,30,As I painfully maneuvered my Charlie from room to room I grew more and more desperate in my attempt to find redeeming qualities in the game.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Electric Playground,30,The games lack of focus poor design and beta-like release state will put it not in the forefront of strategy discussion boards but rather the back of discount software bins.
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameOver.gr,30,A game broken in so many ways even its budget price tag is not enough to save it from oblivion.
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,One begins to wonder where the company found the nerve to release a game that plays as if it were coded by the ultimate beach personality Jeff Spiccoli. [Mar 2004 p.80]
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,The Sydney Morning Herald,30,This official game of the Games however makes it about as exciting as lying in an empty bath and pretending its the luge or sticking your head in the freezer and singing Advance Australia Fair.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Game Almighty,28,It borrows so heavily from the format of Marvel Ultimate Alliance that you’ll likely be hard pressed to find anyone who won’t tell you to simply play that game instead. Considering all the bad movie games we’ve seen in the past year saying that this is one of the worst should really mean something.
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,GamingTrend,40,Drive Girls is a hack and slash slog where you quite literally drive girls who transform into cars to fight evil bugs. It is every bit the stupid ridiculous freaky fun game that it sounds like and has some guilty pleasure elements that can endear it to players even while they recognize it is a total wreck. Battles are unique but ultimately boring and a bad story and lackluster look makes Drive Girls a mostly forgettable mess.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,Cheat Code Central,30,This is the style of arcade game that was around in mechanical form since the early 50s. Its just an on-rails shooter that never lets up. You never move from your position while shooting down swarms of Japanese aircraft with your AA gun. Its so easy to play its ridiculous.
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Core Magazine,33,A game that can only generate slight indifference.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PC,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Informer,30,With the number of average-to-outstanding FPS titles available on next-gen consoles there’s absolutely no reason to waste your time with this disaster. [Apr 2008 p.86]
25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,PC Gamer,30,A sentence of 25 to Life lasts only six to seven hours if played on medium difficulty. [Apr 2006 p.51]
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GamesRadar+,20,Online minigames and a decent selection of cars don’t save Pocket Racers from being one of the worst rubber-burners on Sony’s portable system.
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,NZGamer,30,Its frustrating. More so because the easy bits are so repetitive and simple while the tricky bits are random and insane.
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Cheat Code Central,30,While everything basically works as it should steering is still made difficult by a mixture of poor camera angles and claustrophobic tracks.
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,TheSixthAxis,30,Slapping down poor video games never brings me much pleasure especially those that genuinely show promise. While it has a unique setting and some solid ideas boring level design and a general lack of imagination when piecing together all of these components leaves me with very little to praise.
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,Digitally Downloaded,30,Senran Kagura Reflexions has actually done a lot of damage to the series.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,XGN,30,Havent we all once loved RollerCoaster Tycoon? We too were all cheery and happy when we heard about a new 3DS version of the game. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D proved to be a bummer though not good at all. Say goodbye to your dreams.
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,VideoGamer,30,While Brain Training still clearly continues to rule the brain-boosting roost there is no reason why a few more decent mental agility games shouldnt come along to challenge its title.
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,DarkStation,30,It has so many flaws combined with the short span of the game makes for one that would be near impossible to recommend.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,Appalling levels terrible writing repetitive gags and weak shooting mechanics make for one of the least enjoyable experiences of 2012. Be smart and avoid at all costs. [Issue#93 p.82]
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Cheat Code Central,30,Atrocious. And not atrociously good fun either. Simply atrocious. Its like biting into an Oh Henry and discovering that it is indeed a big fat solid chunk of stanky human dung and undigested peanuts.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,IGN,30,The single player is boring arrestingly conventional and entirely forgettable. The multiplayer is slightly better though mostly because of its options and not because of its gameplay.
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Nintendo Insider,40,Hello Neighbor could be fun within the right parameters. The neighbour would hold a lot more terror if his actions carried any weight. The puzzling aspect of switches hidden doors and traps would be more enjoyable were they staged within an inspiring world or using interesting concepts. But the game fails on all of these points not holding attention not really projecting any fear beyond the first few encounters and the world feels as flat as the polygons used to build it.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,Eurogamer,30,Insultingly simple and clumsy Live Arcade puzzle game unworthy of your time.
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,games(TM),30,Theres simply not enough material here to justify the asking price and the small amount on the disc is sub-par entertainment on almost every level. [Dec 2009 p.111]
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,GamePro,30,Thor: God of Thunder looks terrible plays poorly and was obviously rushed out to market with no fine-tuning whatsoever. Considering that the DS version is so much better by comparison (along with the vastly superior free Flash title from Marvel Studios) Im saddened that this game had to ever exist.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,EGM,30,R.I.P.D.: The Game is really nothing more than a crappy movie tie-in game in the longstanding tradition of crappy movie tie-in games. There’s not much substance here and what you do get is so unpolished and unrewarding that it’s not worth your time.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,PC,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | Shooter | General | First-Person | Modern,GameSpot,30,Raven Squad is 90 percent first-person shooter 10 percent strategy game and 100 percent bad.
Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN,25,This is not a game for Disney fans kids or anyone. In fact its barely a game at all.
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,GameSpot,25,Anacapri has more in common with the ancient gameplay of early 90s adventures than anything modern but even as a pseudo-nostalgia piece its no fun at all.
Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,Xbox 360,Feb-10-2009,Tamsoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,Video Game Talk,30,Just save your money and play something that is actually worth your time.
Tony Hawk's Motion,DS,Nov-18-2008,Creat Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Gameplanet,30,A poorly produced game with little to offer any Tony Hawk fan.

Cartoon Network Racing,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Game Chronicles,32,I was completely disappointed. It tries to be exactly like Mario Kart but it doesn’t even come close to that level of enjoyment. This genre does not need any more lame imitators. It needs innovators.
The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cubed3,30,The blurb for The Deer God promises to Challenge your religion and your platforming skills but it does neither. The platforming moments are ridiculously easy and the combat is easily abused. The worst of the game though is the story which constantly stresses a morality that makes no sense at all all culminating in an absolutely moronic ending. There are many fantastic indie titles that have made the jump to Nindies. This is not one of them.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,Digital Entertainment News,20,If Coffee Tycoon were a beverage it would taste worse than cold coffee with a shot of urine in it. Try Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition for a much more pleasant beverage-tycoon gaming experience.
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,GameSpot,35,Too frustrating and convoluted for kids to have any fun with it and all but the most desperate adult GameCube fans will find it tedious and unentertaining as well.
Resident Evil: Survivor,PlayStation,Aug-30-2000,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,IGN,40,Itll provide you with about four hours maximum of campy brainless shooting kicks. Just dont blame me for feeling dirty afterward because you will oh yes you will.
Realms of Ancient War,PC,Oct-4-2012,Wizarbox,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamereactor Sweden,30,One step away from a total disaster. And that step - lots of enemies - isnt very interesting.
Inkheart,DS,Jan-12-2009,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | General | General,GameShark,25,The one saving grace that the game does has is that is references plenty of older classic novels that young kids may have never heard of.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,One of gamings greatest series bails horribly loses its high score and sinks to a depressing new low. Truly awful.
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,Deeko,35,Id like to recommend the game in some fashion but sadly it took longer to pen this piece than it did for me to get through the actual game with one notable exception - no wrist pain.
Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Germany,30,Guillermo del Toro once said in an interview he made the film for himself and his children and it shows. The game on the other hand might just be the perfect instrument to penalize adolescent troublemakers.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,N-Europe,30,Alone In The Dark is a truly shining example of both how to make a bad game and how to over-hype a game. Avoid.
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,GamePro,40,A neck-stabbingly frustrating bore. [Apr 2004 p.86]
Putty Squad,PlayStation 4,Mar-11-2014,System 3,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Everyeye.it,30,Ugly is not enough to define Putty Squad. It is simply an (almost) unpublished game from 20 years ago with outdated graphics and gameplay.
Motocross Mania 3,Xbox,Apr-27-2005,Deibus Studios,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,BonusStage,37,Wiping your memory clean of Motocross Mania 3 is one of the best things you could do as it is a perfect example of how to not make a game correctly.
Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Modojo,20,Then we come to the control which is also shot up quite horrendously. The vehicular turning is pretty lofty at best where you have to maintain an incredible sense of steering. This combined with the so-called tactics for scoring takedowns on opponent vehicles just leads to remarkably bad frustration.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Spain,30,Avoid at all costs. Playability is awful and even the girls arent that sexy: they are destroyed by low polygon count models and horrible textures.

[Issue#203]
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,Gamervision,30,Attack of the Movies 3-D is one of the worst games I’ve played in a long time.
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,30,Painkiller: Resurrection is a bugfest. It is technically outdated and the co-op mode is hidden between the menus. There is no way to make this multiplayer mode work well.
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Edge Magazine,30,Theres little satisfaction in downing an enemy who cant see you less in getting flattened by an unseen assailant. [Issue#296 p.114]

Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,Gamers' Temple,29,The nonexistent tutorial clunky interface rough and bland graphics and quirky AI are all hallmarks of a game released too early... more an exercise in frustration and bewilderment than a game.
Driven,PlayStation 2,Nov-6-2001,Bam Entertainment,Driving | Racing | Formula One,GamerWeb Sony,20,Just stay away from Driven for the love of God stay away.
Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Some subjects will just never translate well into videogames--like anything related to proctology Paris Hilton or yes MTV shows. [Feb. 2007 p.79]
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,AceGamez,30,Godzilla Unleashed is a latter-generation PS2 title arriving just in time for Christmas - it doesnt play well it doesnt look good and it doesnt offer anything new.
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Edge Magazine,30,Realmforge is clearly a student of the genre but budget is king here and the studio lacks the financial clout to even pierce the flesh of a crowded market. Despite being crafted with noble intentions Dark succeeds only in sucking the life out of itself.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Master (Greece),38,What’s frustrating is that Terminal Reality whether you believe it or not had laid the foundations for an extraordinary game. WD:SI includes all the activities that a decent zombie survival game should have. [May 2013]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,XGN,30,How can such a bad game be part of the Summer of Arcade? Those games need to be special. This Turtles game is definitely not.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,GameFocus,34,Its not that Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles is completely broken its just that each and every aspect of it is so flawed that it results in an experience that is mediocre at best.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamingTrend,30,Even a game with a bad story can be salvageable if the gameplay is fun. Unfortunately this isn’t the case.
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Gaming Nexus,25,Thor: God of Thunder is what one would come to expect with other movie-licensed games. The cinematics are sub-par the combo system is quite repetitive and the difficulty is skewed. The only redeeming qualities I found were using the leveling system to actually refill your health and Odin Force and the effects of the elemental attacks looked cool but the fun factor is just not there.
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Pure Xbox,30,Theres scope here for a good game were a bit more work put in but the smart money says that youll be way more frustrated with Project Roots patently unfair gameplay than you are impressed by it.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,32,While the graphics and hole designs are inviting the frustrations caused by the controls and Barker himself successfully put a damper on the entire experience.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Youd be a Raven lunatic to buy it. [Oct 2009 p.90]
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,IGN,30,This is an even worse game than Empire Earth 3 for the simple fact that the design shows promise but its utterly undermined by the horrible execution.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpot,30,Who knew that samurai swordfighting could ever be so dull and annoying?
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GameZone,30,If you’re looking for Tony Hawk Pro Skater for a much younger crowd or really love the show Simpsons Skateboarding will surely disappoint.
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,20,Re-playing Blades of Time in 2019 is surreal. There are assuredly many better games from the previous generation of consoles that deserve to be on Switch ahead of this one. I can’t even imagine the developers have any hope of using this re-release to springboard the franchise back as they work on a sequel because no one is going to want a sequel after playing it. Time hasn’t been good to Blades of Time and and other than for the morbidly curious I can’t see anyone being masochistic enough to derive any value out of it.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,More revolting than it is a revolution. [May 2009 p.87]
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Game Chronicles,30,Legend of the Dragon is a disappointment for a fighting game. There is a general lack of anything that stands out to make it worth paying attention to or purchasing.
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,UploadVR,20,Heavy Fire: Red Shadow is short and for once in a linear game that’s a good thing because I wanted to move on with my life the second I had finished playing it. Casually prejudiced generic in nearly every way and an absolute bore to slog through it genuinely might be the worst game on PlayStation VR. If you’re given this as a gift cut out that person from your life even if they’re a blood relative. It isn’t worth it.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Electronic Gaming Monthly,30,T3s first-person shooting stages are plagued by poor controls terrible level designs brain-dead enemies and just plain ugly graphics. [Feb 2004 p.106]
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Eurogamer,30,To call Lost Swords a failed experiment would be an insult to every ambitious game that fell flat on its face. It feels like Namco put barely any thought into making the not-so-micro-transactions justifiable or even making sure that the single-player focus felt consistently engaging.
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,GameGrin,35,Dying: Reborn is an interesting enough puzzle game that falls short of making any kind of impact at all. A cash-in game for the VR age skipping this title would be recommended.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamereactor Denmark,30,Harry Potter turns into a wannabe third person shooter and the result is abysmal. Movie-based games get a bad rap and its because of titles like this one. We cant think of anything nice to say about it not even when playing it with Kinect. Its a bad game from end to end and has no redeeming qualities. Avoid at all cost even if (or maybe especially if) youre a Harry Potter-head.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,CD-Action,35,The concept for the game is great level design is solid and the visuals are sometimes nice but the whole thing is painfully underdone. [02/2018 p.46]
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,30,Dull repetitive and carelessly programmed dont even begin to sum up how crummy this action game based on the Looney Tunes license is.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Hot Games,20,Its as tired and useless as many of the wrestlers represented and playing this is almost like watching a seniors match in wrestling -- old familiar faces doing the same old familiar moves that made them famous.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Worth Playing,30,Avoid this title like the plague. Not only are you sparing yourself the discomfort of ham-fisted preaching and shoddy game mechanics you’ll also be doing your part to ensure that this obscene mess of eschatological flotsam and apocryphal jetsam never sees a sequel.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Variety,20,Sierra couldnt have picked a more forgettable swan song than an adaptation of the latest iteration in the blandly epic Mummy franchise thats as dull to look at as it is to play.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,PSM Magazine,30,Save for a few boss designs the graphics are dull while the arcade-styled controls are so simple as to almost reward a lack of skill. [Feb 2003 p.33]
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Pocket Games,20,Overall wed prefer death to torture and perhaps both to an extended session playing this game. [Winter 2002 p.47]
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,IGN,30,Without nearly enough sight gags or over-the-top style to actually put that humor in the game its kind of pointless.
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Destructoid,30,This motion never works consistently and the controller itself (which the game says you need to hold as both movement and firing are done from it) even blocks your hands from the sensor sometimes. This basically means that in the heat of battle youre putting your hands in front of you back and forth constantly just to see/shoot/move and go back to view your instruments.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,NZGamer,30,Bumbling combat laughable visuals and terribly overpriced.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,GamingTrend,26,Unfortunately nostalgia rarely holds up they couldnt even implement the new systems features and instead of taking something old and reinventing it they made a broken version of a classic game with graphics that have no character.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,Metro GameCentral,30,FIFA Street meets Mario Strikers but even as an arcade game this falls well short of world class.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GamePro,30,It doesnt matter if youre a hardcore or casual fan: theres no magic to be seen here.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameDaily,30,One of the Wiis worst games an underdeveloped mess that will turn off most of its players by the middle – or possibly even the beginning -- of level one. Ubisoft attempted some innovative control techniques but most of them feel awful-- even doing simple things like jumping and lobbing grenades sucks.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,God is a Geek,30,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle is the worst Touhou game I’ve played and one that you should avoid unless you absolutely must own everything Touhou.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,DarkStation,30,This is the freshman effort for developer We the Force Studios and it is certainly noticeable throughout the entirety of Randall. The Mexico based developer has crafted a game that obviously pays homage to a style of gameplay that they are fond of. However the end result is little more than just that: an homage without any of the hooks that make other games of this variety so great. There is certainly potential for a great game within Randall and I hope this fledgling developer is able to learn from its mistakes to craft a more cohesive game in its next attempt.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,30,A botched excuse for a stealth game whose only achievement is bringing a decent series name into disrepute. This game should have been so much better. [Jan 2007 p.72]
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,1UP,30,The core problem with Napoleon Dynamite: The Game is that it totally disregards the humor of the film (and as such of the audience its attempting to reach). The whole joke of Napoleon Dynamite was that Jon Heders titular character constantly claims to have more skill than he actually possesses. In the game you have all that skill and more.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,The Sydney Morning Herald,30,This official game of the Games however makes it about as exciting as lying in an empty bath and pretending its the luge or sticking your head in the freezer and singing Advance Australia Fair.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,WHAM! Gaming,30,Pocket Pool largely fails as a billiards simulation and completely fails as a source of titillation. Go to the local pool hall and talk to some flesh and blood women instead.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,games(TM),30,Had the handling and collision detection been improved then Wheelspin might actually have been a good game. [Issue#91 p.114]
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Pocket Gamer UK,30,A rushed production that regrettably yet predictably emerges as a substandard game of a substandard film.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,GameSpot,35,Just because a game seemingly aims to be bad on purpose doesnt make it any less of a bad game.
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Game Revolution,25,The game really doesnt offer anything interesting aside from the whole shape-shifting thing which is does poorly. With empty battles and bland side-quests the point of it all is lost.
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Kombo,30,Throughout its lifespan Legend of the Dragon fails to entertain for more than a few minutes.
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Awful - a crushing disappointment. [Oct 2010 p.102]
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Core Magazine,25,Realizing that you have just spent 40 hard earned dollars on a game that is barely more enjoyable than reading a cereal box really takes the cake in terms of excruciating actualization.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,To be fair the backgrounds look pretty. [Jan 2005 p.90]
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Jeuxvideo.com,30,Agony clearly deserves its name. The gameplay mechanics are chaotic at best the AI is plain dumb the level-design is muddled the scenario is boring… Well there’s nothing to save here.
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Eurogamer,30,It could have been an interesting title but the problems with control weird gameplay style terrible graphics and rigged repetitive games just kill any joy that would be garnered from playing it.
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,All Game Guide,30,The biggest issue players will likely have is fighting off sheer boredom instead of a pack of orcs trolls or scorpions.
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Informer,25,If the single-player campaign isn’t painful enough Hour of Victory offers a multiplayer component so poorly constructed that just trying to shoot another person makes you feel as stupid and incompetent as the game’s AI. At the very most Hour of Victory is deserving of Worst Game of the Year honors.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,IGN,25,This is a bad game from top to bottom and it doesnt deserve a moment of your attention.
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,GameSpot,26,One thing is fact: NFL Blitz 2002 for the GBA is a stinker.
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,30,With so many narrative technical and gameplay issues that pop up at almost every turn — all wound up within some of the worst third-person stealth mechanics imaginable — Left Alive is both a horridly-conceived experience and a fundamentally unenjoyable product to even attempt to immerse one’s self in.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,All Game Guide,40,Defender proves that more is not necessarily better especially when it comes to modes of play. Rather than take a rock solid format and enhance it through multiple variants of the same basic theme the developers have created a mess and tried to cover it up with different versions that all have weaknesses.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Zany but this price is just ridiculous. [June 2008 p.79]
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,IGN,30,Underworld Ascendant is a buggy repetitive and boring mess of an RPG.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,31,Wonderworld Amusement Park has no personality; no soul. Theres nothing on offer here that other Wii mini-game collections havent already beaten to death. Whats worse many of these games are frustrating or have unresponsive controls.
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,Worth Playing,30,Basically Ready 2 Rumble Revolution for the Wii is nearly unplayable. I love the idea of having an arcade boxer on the Wii and while boxing on Wii Sports didnt exactly blow my socks off it worked out far better than this game did. Im not sure that complicated controls for an arcade boxer are the way to go on the Wii and Ready 2 Rumble proves that more punch types dont necessarily translate into a better boxing experience.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,TotalGames.net,30,It doesn’t seem to know whether it wants to be a realistic simulation of the sport or a straight-out arcade game as it stands it manages to succeed as neither.
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Digitally Downloaded,30,Crystal Rift possesses all the potential in the world and I certainly hope the game performs well enough that the development team is able to go back to the drawing board and come up with a more comprehensive and nuanced structure for another crack at the VR dungeon crawler.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,Just Adventure,25,Virtually unplayable.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,Console Monster,28,It is playable but only just for a few minutes.
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameSpot,35,Escape from Bug Island is a dismal reminder of the low points of survival horrors past.
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameZone,35,A boring party game that lacks the pace and originality of its genre counterparts Tamagotchi: Party On should be avoided at all costs.
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,IGN,25,Skip over 3D Classics: Urban Champion. Urban Champion is not a classic it never was and 3D is entirely wasted on it.
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gameblog.fr,20,Very inspired by the Lucha Libre comic Lucha Fury offers a really polished artistic direction colorful visuals and a fun mexican wrestling take on the atmosphere. But once you get your hands on the controller it feels like youve been suplexed hard : the gameplay clearly lacks smoothness the characters feel like theyre ice skating all the time collision bugs are legion and theres latency in the execution of the combat moves... The special moves seem dull and there arent any enemy really fun to battle. Levels are repetitive poorly paced musics can make you crazy... its the typical example of a beatem all with a world and atmosphere that would have been perfect for the genre if only the gameplay wasnt a real mess.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,ZTGD,25,If I was to walk up to someone and ask Have you played Fluster Cluck? I’d probably get the strange eye which pretty much sums up my thoughts on the game as a whole.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,PC Gamer,21,Chances are youll have more fun reading a medical textbook. [August 2002 p.69]
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,A joyless chore. [Apr 2018 p.84]
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,Eurogamer,30,The idea of an interactive comic as narrative expansion is a sound one but Ignition entirely fails to do the concept justice.
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,PSM3 Magazine UK,31,Curiously the real stars of the show - the blokes at West Coast Customs - arent here. Instead you drive around the fictional city in unresponsive cars. [May 2007 p.78]
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,The game taught us that Japan lost the war thanks to shattered AI and terrible clipping. [May 2008 p.111]
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,AceGamez,30,This leads me onto the AI of which Im not sure there actually is any.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,1UP,20,Its being sold now for $20. In a week when they are selling it for $4.99 it will still be overpriced.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,games(TM),10,Its not a game. [Issue#118 p.106]
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,DarkStation,30,I can’t recommend Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn - it’s a joke that fizzles out quickly and leaves a sour taste in your mouth.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameSpot,26,Terrible. This first-person shooter from Red Storm Entertainment suffers from graphical problems poor control and terrible AI and on top of all that it can be beaten in less than two hours your first time through.
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,Gamer.no,30,Pure garbage is one way to put it but it would be strict. This ridiculous racer has its moments deeply hidden in between terrible controls that will make you test if the Move controllers can destroy a TV.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,NZGamer,40,Its disappointing and hard to fathom that given how much was riding on the game EA could have dropped the ball so completely.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Brash Games,30,Overall this game is not good. Do not waste your time or your money. If Milky Tea want to make another racing game they have a lot to work on before they will interest me again. It is up to you whether you let it tarnish your PS4 but in my case I have already deleted the game off of my game library.
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GameSpot,30,In X-Men: Destiny awful combat and meaningless choices combine to create a new mutation of boredom.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,GameSpot,26,Every aspect of the game is categorically bad; the story is tough to follow the graphics are lousy and the gameplay is so contrived and repetitive that its unlikely anyone will garner much enjoyment from the game no matter how low their standards are for being entertained.
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Totally360,30,Overall Damnation is a complete mess. With the amount of quality titles that have been released so far this year it would be time well spent if you spent it elsewhere.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpy,30,This is one game that should have never been let out of a holding cell.
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,20,Apart from the bugs the game is just so utterly unappealing aesthetically and from a gameplay perspective that it feels almost like a tech demo (of tech from 1999) rather than an honest-to-goodness release title. Please dont waste your hard-earned dough on this mutt.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Eurogamer,20,But the really depressing thing about PlayFirsts spirit-crushing little game is that itll probably sell enough to result in a deluge of the bloody things and force us to question the sanity of mankind. Again.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,GamesRadar+,30,We have a game that tries its best but still feels a half-decade behind we have a guitar that isnt and we have a drum kit so flawed its almost offensive. Add it all together and take the average and it comes out to a nice even 3.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,IGN,20,The biggest problem is just that none of what Air Conflicts offers is fun.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,VGPub,25,This game insulted my intelligence as a gamer and a human being. I found very little entertainment while playing this game and feel ripped off that I spent five bucks on it.
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,IGN,30,Ladies and gentlemen this game sucks... a real stinking pile.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,25,The only real change-up in the whole game is when the Turtles get shiny cybernetic-looking gear when they travel into the future. Its literally wave after wave of enemies through eight stages that serve as mere backdrops. And that wasnt really what was worth remembering from the old days.
Hollow,Switch,Feb-22-2018,MMEU,Action Adventure | Survival,NintendoWorldReport,30,Hollow as a game is an effective horror experience plagued by some poor goal communication with the player. It has clear issues but at its core Hollow is a technically impressive game built on generally good gameplay. As a port to Switch this game is unfortunately an abysmal mess.
Legends of Pegasus,PC,Aug-10-2012,Kalypso | Novacore Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | 4X,PC PowerPlay,30,An impenetrable mess with almost nothing to recommend it. Cast this one into the void. [Oct 2012 p.73]
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,Xbox 360,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,GamesRadar+,30,We have a game that tries its best but still feels a half-decade behind we have a guitar that isnt and we have a drum kit so flawed its almost offensive. Add it all together and take the average and it comes out to a nice even 3.
Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Game Informer,30,This isn’t a premier blend of pulp fiction. It’s just a pulpy mess.
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,Push Square,20,This title is one of a very rare breed one that will appeal to absolutely no one and buying it would quite literally be akin to throwing your money away.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameShark,30,This time around were presented with the same flat panel crowds barren brown landscapes and under-animated riders that weve all seen and played before. Heck even the character select screen looks boring.
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,30,The graphics are bland the sound is grating and the gameplay is about as much fun as watching paint dry. There are better things you could do with twenty dollars.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Areajugones,30,Umbrella Corps is the most expensive free-to-play that you will find in the market. Not only is its gameplay terrible but its online mode does not feature anybody to play with so the game is almost dead by now. Capcom made us cry.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,TheSixthAxis,30,Though Risen 3 has its moments there is simply too much to overlook even if you’re patient enough to make it five or six hours into the game. Role-playing die hards may be able to wring a few morsels of enjoyment from Titan Lords though others including casual fans of the genres will find it almost unplayable.
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,MS Xbox World,30,With the hefty $10.00 price tag for Double D Dodgeball all gamers alike should dodge this title (no pun intended).
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,RPG Site,20,Poor performance is bad enough but let me put it as simply as possible - the port in this state should not have been allowed to release. Its an embarrassment and Idea Factory clearly knew what a stinker the game was with the haphazard axing of the games originally planned English dub and NA physical releases. Arc of Alchemist is the worst game that I have ever reviewed and I sincerely hope that Idea Factory takes the time to really consider how this game came out the way that it did. I know they can do better than this.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Pelit (Finland),30,The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. [Jan. 05]
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,TheSixthAxis,20,If it means having to play Eternity to save them youre better off letting that last Unicorn go extinct.
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,DarkStation,20,In the end what we have in Tokyo Tattoo Girls is by far one of the most shallow strategy games Ive ever seen with absolutely a joke of a story and shallow and repetitive gameplay. Its just so utterly disappointing in just about every aspect. As someone who doesnt have any tattoos (although my wife more than makes up for me) I think Id rather go get my first one than play this game any more than I had to.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,SpazioGames,30,One Piece: Grand Cruise is an awful experience that lacks both in content and quality.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameCritics,30,Something like Infernal: Hells Vengeance might have gained a minor following during the last generation (and thats a big might have) but it simply doesnt have any place in todays environment. Its technically weak and showcases no forward-thinking in terms of design and the conceptual side is just as stale.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Armchair Empire,30,It has a great idea in terms of graphical presentation and plotline but it throws it all away through poor gameplay design.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,Pocket Gamer UK,30,Over-ambitious 3D free-roaming stunt-a-thon which ends up being just hard to control repetitive and completely unsuited to DS.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Gamer's Hell,29,It isn’t the worst game ever made but that just means that it fails to achieve distinction even by its badness.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,DailyGame,30,I can sum it up with one word: sloppy.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Gamestyle,30,The game play is too repetitive and a combination of poor controls and poor visuals make it frustrating to complete the levels. Its hard to imagine many people whatever their ages having the supreme patience to actually sit through more than a few hours of this game.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,20,If you need a comic-book movie-license game fix look elsewhere. I beg you. [Aug 2007 p.83]
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,Digital Chumps,30,Adding insult to injury is the success Dead Rising 2: Case Zero a $5 fully produced prequel to Dead Rising 2. The bar was raised and Ignition has no business occupying the same space.
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,High-Def Digest,30,I am struggling to understand why people would choose this over some of the really excellent survival games out there. Maybe on PC it’s really great. On the Xbox One it is not.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameSpot,24,A miserable failure...Gamers are advised to avoid this game period.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,IGN,29,Its not funny and its not fun to play. If the developers had simply fine tuned the collision detection it probably would have been fine.
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Informer,33,It pains me to say this but turn off your TV and just read the book or head to your local theater. This is a story everyone must experience just don’t try interacting with it.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Eurogamer,20,Enemy Front is a bad game on almost every level but it gives me no pleasure to report that. Its not a lazy game as you can see the developer trying as hard as it can to mimic the juggernauts that dominate the genre but nor does it show enough personality or ambition to break out of the tired old paradigms.
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,GamesRadar+,20,Showtime Championship Boxing would be a lousy looker two console generations ago; in 2008 it’s nothing short of a Mike Tyson-biting-ears-level embarrassment...Every aspect of Showtime Championship Boxing is baffling.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,Pocket Games,30,Single-player mode has you spending more time trying to avoid getting hit than aiming for the hoop which gets annoying real quick. [Fall 2003 p.54]
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Warcry,25,A truly incomprehensible final product. This game although given the title Bad Boys and perhaps living up to the vulgarity and profanity of the movies does nothing to quell the hunger for explosion action wit or anything that the movies may have given me in an equal amount of time. What a waste.
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Youre left with awkward stilted voice-acting serviceable graphics and rote button-pushing that feel less like a game experience and more like channel-surfing on your couch. Skip.
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,CryEngine does not guarantee any fun. Interesting action game at first sight but then shows emptiness and boredom quite soon. All levels weapons and enemy designs are so wearisome that you will find it quite refreshing to read your spam folder instead. [July 2009]
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Revolution,25,Ultimately though the biggest blow against the game is its brevity. You shouldnt have trouble clearing its single-player mode in two or three hours.
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,NZGamer,30,Overall Girl Fight feels like a cheap less fluid (motion-wise) knock off of Dead or Alive. The arcade mode demands you play through at least seven times which wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing if this were a better game.
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,GameSpot,25,As Valhalla Knights moves to the Wii any potential for fun is buried under tons of repetitive busywork and technical gaffs.
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,Destructoid,20,Super Seducer: How to Talk to Women is too stupid to be sexist. It’s a relic from the Entourage era we’re all better off having moved on from and absolutely nothing to get worked up over.
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,PSM Magazine,30,It just isnt any good. With so many gameplay problems lack of challenges and an absolute treaure trove of better FPS titles out there for PS2 theres no reason to give this one a second thought. [Jan 2004 p.46]
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,GameSpot,30,Star Raiders achieves the incredible somehow taking all the fun out of being a hotshot space pilot.
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,GameZone,30,It’s simple really. King of Clubs just isn’t any fun to play and in an industry obsessed with making money at the consumers’ expense and developing safe-bet hit software developers would do well to take note: video games should be fun.
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Cubed3,30,Langrisser Re:Incarnation -Tensei- seems decent based on pictures or perhaps a short on paper explanation but it quickly becomes apparent how rushed development must have been.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Thunderbolt,20,Avoid like you would a vicious infection.
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine,15,But the biggest bug of all came when Fireburst simply stopped working and hard-froze our console any time we tried loading an event. Deleting and downloading the game anew didn’t help; we had to start over using another gamertag. Were we not reviewing this horrendous bug-ridden racer we would’ve taken that as a welcome sign to burn it from our memories and never look back.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,PC Games,27,Rambo: The Video Game is indeed Your worst nightmare. This on-rails shooting gallery looks and plays like a game made by two monkeys. And it doesn’t even turn blue...
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,Computer Gaming World,20,This game is so full of bad ideas that make a mockery of good reading material. [Feb 2002 p.101]
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,GamesRadar+,20,Between the cut down roster of famous faces from the movies cast frustrating control mechanics and noticeable lack of polish the movie tie-in gives few reasons to invest your time and money in a download.
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,IGN,22,A failure on every level.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Games (Russia),25,Shadow Harvest will only bring pain and suffering into your life. Avoid it at all costs. [June 2011 p. 102]
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,Riot Pixels,20,If you burn $15 and scatter the ashes you will have more fun than you would by playing this game.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,For those who can look past the game’s flaws there are a few hours of mindless destruction and anal-probing to be had here but only if you’ve exhausted every other game out there.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Push Square,30,The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is an appalling unpolished mess. Gameplay is dull and buggy there’s very little attempt at a plot the characters are unlikeable and bar a couple of interesting mechanics everything feels rushed and dated. The likenesses and voices are accurate with Norman Reedus and Michael Rooker reprising their roles as Daryl and Merle respectively but that isn’t enough to rescue this abomination from the shallow grave of wretchedness that it has dug for itself.
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,4Players.de,20,If the goal was to demonstrate what can go wrong in terms of game design presentation and visual quality: Congratulations you passed with flying colors! Nothing in this game is appealing or entertaining.
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,11,A horrendous mess of a game horrible to play in every way short of severing your hands at the wrists and squirting lemon on the stumps. [Mar 2007 p.70]
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Jeuxvideo.com,30,Agony clearly deserves its name. The gameplay mechanics are chaotic at best the AI is plain dumb the level-design is muddled the scenario is boring… Well there’s nothing to save here.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,GamePro,30,Not being able to transform in a Transformers game is ridiculous.
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,PC Gamer,35,Be warned...You Are Empty isnt so much a title as a disclaimer. [Mar 2008 p.74]
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Edge Magazine,30,Partial blame can be laid on the less-than-stellar CG film Astro Boy adapts but considering High Voltage so vocally invoked Omega Factor during development it is not unfair to hold the game to a higher standard. It doesnt come close. [Jan 2010 p.96]
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,Detroit Free Press,25,While the Internet play is the frenzied chaotic fun youve come to expect from a Bomberman title (though it has some loading issues) youre completely unable to blow up buddies sitting on the couch next to you.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,20,Its never fun to play a game thats so fundamentally uninteresting that you really struggle to even watch the screen as youre playing.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,IGN,21,One of the most boring generic games out there even with a strong character like Vic Mackey. Theres really nothing about the gameplay visuals sound or story that can justify a purchase.
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Eurogamer Italy,30,Girl Fight is simply one of the worst fighting games out there. In a world where you can buy Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown with just a few euros nobody should ever think about downloading this crappy clone of Tecmos Dead or Alive.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,GamingWorld X,20,The game is a total disaster with no redeeming qualities. Konami has taken an interesting license and thrown away all potential.
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,Xbox Evolved,23,A terrible game. If for some reason you actually decide to go and pay $20 for this very poor excuse of a first person shooter then expect to find: a weak and very uninteresting story the absolute worst gameplay ever on the Xbox repetitive textures and bland colors and a very poor sound scheme.
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,IGN,30,Do not pass go head directly to jail. Its bad. Boring. And also bad.
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,PSFocus,25,Amy makes us understand parents who hit their children and that statement on itself is scarier than the hours we wasted playing this piece of crap.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Metro GameCentral,20,The only asses that need kicking in this game are those of the developer responsible for such rubbish.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,Nintendo Gamer,20,The mini missions are klunky beyond belief with extremely shoddy animation and they almost always have to be completed in a stupidly short length of time for enjoyment - and thats it. Ideal for morons with low expectations. [Feb 2007 p.82]
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,PTGamers,25,The Incredible Hulk: The Official Videogame is simply one of the worst super-hero tie-ins of all time.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,IGN,26,An all around mess of a game Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing is officially one of (if not THE) worst examples of digital boxing weve ever seen.
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,games(TM),30,Overall Farming Simulator does not feel like a simulator – if the point of the game is to offer a realistic experience of what it’s like to run a farm the game fails: people never fatigue (your staff will work straight through the 24-clock if left unattended) livestock produce is harvested by AI automatically and there’s a few game-breaking exploits that completely undermine the game.
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,NZGamer,28,Patches may stop the glitches but I think this space sim is far beyond repair.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,BaziCenter,25,Nostalgia always works right? All the drama and all the emotions hit the right spot in the brain and suddenly you are in love with something. Dawn of Fear is here to prove this theory wrong. It seem that the only thing the developers worked on was the nostalgia aspect and nothing else. Quite simply stay away from this game.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,Worth Playing,25,It’s obviously slapped together for a quick buck but it isn’t worth yours. With poor gameplay and underpar production values you won’t be seeing this title praised by anyone.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Electronic Gaming Monthly,22,Its pure boredom harnessed in cartridge form. [Feb 2004 p.128]
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,PC Gamer,17,What really condemns Demonworld though are its atrocious graphics and horrific AI and pathfinding. [Apr 2002 p.73]
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,GameSpot,29,Dragon Booster is a halfhearted and practically unplayable racing game with no redeeming qualities.
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,InsideGamer.nl,20,The single player campaign of Declassified is barely worth mentioning; within one hour youve seen it all. The multiplayer doesnt keep you interested for much longer. Its light on maps and modes but more importantly it misses action. Black Ops Declassified makes us miss the time of the UMD when a sub-par game could at least be used as a fancy coaster.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameSpot,17,More punishment than game. No matter what the box says this isnt so much a fantasy role-playing game as it is a medieval torture device right up there with the rack and the iron maiden.
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,Nintendophiles,15,It doesnt help that the AI is ludicrously tough and as cheap as possible. The AI can pull off moves that the gamer couldnt possibly do as fast.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Cheat Code Central,26,Avoid this title like a 12th century leper. It’s easily the worst game of the launch the worst giant robot game ever and front runner for worst anime-inspired game in history.
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,GameWatcher,20,The epitome of a terrible movie tie-in game.
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,NTSC-uk,20,Only pick this up if youre the sort of person who buys supermarket own-brand bog roll and enjoys the rough sawdust texture.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PC Zone UK,27,Combat though is miserable. [Aug 2008 p.73]
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Xbox Nation Magazine,20,The twin albatrosses of slowdown and mediocre graphics loom large over Dragon and shoddy programming allows for honest-to-dreadfulness crashes. [Fall 2002 p.118]
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,30,Rekoil suffers from game-breaking glitches that range from aggravating to completely bewildering.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,Multiplayer.it,20,Zombeer is an utter disaster plain & simple. Dont buy it even if you are the best zombie fan out there.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,ZTGD,20,It is a great thing to bring light to an under promoted sport such as womens volleyball but in this case its like Ronald McDonald promoting P.E.T.A. It doesnt really help. So whatever you do DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,28,Celebrity Deathmatchs biggest problem isnt its timing but rather its the absolutely horrid gameplay and complete lack of any worthwhile features.
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,Digital Chumps,20,Weeping Doll is a brief presentation of experiments that do not work in virtual reality. Its theme is neither frightening nor coherent its puzzles are mundane and straightforward player movement is disorienting and inelegant and its visual aesthetic imitates the vision of a person with a dangerous blood alcohol concentration. Weeping Doll blunders its format worse than Digital Pictures full-motion video projects miscalculated the Sega CD.
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,GameSpot,19,Land of the Dead fails to deliver even the most garden-variety of zombie-killing thrills due to its inept combat awful visuals and cripplingly stupid artificial intelligence.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,X-ONE Magazine UK,20,A poor entry into a solid series that doesnt try to improve the experience or come up with any new ideas. Stick with the past and wait for the future. [Issue#119 p.85]
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,20,I might even consider it the worst Sonic game I have ever played.
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,XBLA Fans,20,If Gene Rain ever goes on sale for $5 and you’re desperate for some achievements then by by all means pick it for the points. Otherwise there is no redeeming value in paying anything for the game. There are no strong aspects. Literally nothing is done well. I wish I could say despite all the negatives but I can’t. Gene Rain is just awful and you should save your time and money.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,We Got This Covered,30,Giana Sisters: Dream Runners is far too fast frenetic and convoluted for its own good. Run away from this one before it entices you to spend any money.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Gamers' Temple,20,The real test of intelligence here is whether or not you are smart enough to avoid this game.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,The Digital Fix,20,The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is an abomination on every level: a dull cynical and irreparably flawed mess which is as mindless and soulless as its antagonists.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,Deeko,20,With 12 missions of choppy impossible to play through graphics enemy AI which is apparently psychic and sound that is just plain bad New World Order isnt a game you want in your library... or home... or state.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Its often difficult to tell where your characters bullets are heading and sometimes tough to see if environmental elements are being affected by your gunfire both of which are vital in a shooter.
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,PTGamers,20,Jenga is here just to fill the gap with no attention to quality whatsoever only to make a quick buck at the expense of distracted fans.

Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,IGN,20,A terrible racing game and its an even worse competition game. You might as well save yourself some cash and just stab yourself in the eye.

Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,N-Europe,20,It was a game no-one noticed because no-one should notice this. Ever. Dont bother looking at it never mind buying or renting it.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Push Square,20,Magus is not an entertaining game. It suffers from repetitive gameplay bugs glitches and abhorrent visuals. Worse still it’s expensive with the release currently commanding a laughable $24.99 price point on the PlayStation Store. Put your time and money towards something better than this.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,ZTGD,20,Stay away from this game even for a cheap buck. Who ya gonna call? Hopefully the store where this game was purchased from in hopes of asking for a refund.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Hot Games,30,A full point goes to the voice cast. Otherwise we wouldn’t use the disc for a Duff beer coaster.

Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GamePro,20,The characters models are ugly despite aspiring towards cuteness and the soundtrack will turn your brain into oatmeal.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,Game Revolution,20,Quality assurance is a beautiful thing people. It keeps sprites on the screen weapons able to be picked up when available always and everything working as they should. I dont know if all was alright in Windows but playing on a Mac… well dont bother.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,XGN,40,Dead Horde is a game that is riddled with bugs that could have been easily prevented. Sure the graphics are good and the co-op is pretty fun but the gameplay gets very boring very fast.
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Giant Bomb,40,Unfortunately Mr. Driller Online is plagued by a meager selection of gameplay modes and bug-ridden online play that keep it from being worth the $10 price tag.
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,We Got This Covered,50,Infinity Runner for better and worse is a standard uneventful running game made for a console instead of a mobile device. It’s repetitive simplistic and meandering – but that may just be the diversion you’re seeking.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,IGN,45,This is the very definition of a budget racer and I dont mean that in a good way. Basic arcadey track designs mix with stupidly simple controls and poor graphics for an end experience that falls somewhere below the average.
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Jeuxvideo.com,45,Generation Zero stumbles on its own concept et never achieves to find balance between shooter and survival. Repetitive and dull it does have some ideas but they don’t have enough impact to hide all the flaws.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,GameSpot,44,Hard Truck: Apocalypse takes an interesting premise and strips away all but the most mundane elements leaving you to drive down a long and unexciting road to nowhere.
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,AceGamez,40,Hard Rock Casino is a poor game that could have been thoroughly enjoyable; however the lack of polish presentation and playability make this a game I simply cannot recommend. I like to make a bet every now and again but place your money on Hard Rock Casino and youre backing a guaranteed loser.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GamesRadar+,50,Its slow-paced combat and exploration weak visuals and plodding plot leave a lot to be desired.
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PSX-Sense.nl,45,A shooter with a lot of potential which turns out to be a soulless repetitive and boring husk of a game. Graphically it looks alright and shooting stuff up is fun for a while but youll soon be thinking about better things you could have been doing instead. The immersion is completely broken due to not being able to move around freely. While conceptually a great idea Bravo Teams execution falls short and that is a shame.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendojo,42,I wouldn’t say it was a mistake to bring Rodea to 3DS but the game is so rough that it either needed more time in development or the handheld was incapable of fully handling Naka’s vision. For fans of the creator’s previous works and players who enjoy 3D adventure titles Rodea is worth a look but be prepared to fight with it in order to get any enjoyment out of the game.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,GameZone,42,The biggest thing that make this game get such a low score is non-responsive controls and framerate issues will make you want to slam your precious PlayStation Portable against a brick wall.
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,XGP Gaming,43,Basically theres nothing to like about Catwoman outside of the graphics. At the very most the game deserves a rental.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameZone,55,There are so many bugs in this game that at times it is unplayable and futile to even attempt to do so.
Shadow the Hedgehog,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2005,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Jolt Online Gaming UK,41,Shadow the Hedgehog is awful. Stay away from it.
Crash: Mind Over Mutant,DS,Oct-7-2008,TOSE,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Cheat Code Central,46,Mind Over Mutant gets more wrong than it gets right leaving anyone who picks up the game with nothing more than the aching feeling of buyer’s remorse.
Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,51,This is a waste of a property that could be great game fare.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN Italia,40,Rodea the Sky Soldier on Wii U is a good idea but a broken game with a frustrating control scheme. Visually its a game of almost a decade ago. Forget it.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,Destructoid,40,Warriors of Troy just about delivers some simple button mashing action without too much fuss but hack n slash fans would do best to wait for Dynasty Warriors 7. That game sports more character in a single trailer than this does in the entire experience.
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,GamingExcellence,40,Fan boys will get theyre fix and thats about the extent of FBMs scope providing little to none entertainment value past the first 30 minutes.
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,44,Long load times and limited magazines feel more like a cheap way to pad the games length than to capture an historic feel especially when these weapons are far more accurate at a far greater range in the game than their real-world counterparts ever were.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Absolute Games,41,The Scourge Project is a perfect example of how an inexperienced developer bit more than they could chew. They wanted to create a multi-platform action title with a great story and a four-player cooperative gameplay but made a threepenny whangdoodle instead.
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,PC Gamer,43,A beautiful but baffling space strategy game. Bugs and bewildering menus make for a frustrating and very missable experience.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gaming Target,45,There is certainly enough content here but the poor controls and graphics dont give players any incentive to check it out.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,1UP,42,As a stand-alone download its a short rendition of the Watchmen brawler experience that features more low points than high points -- but with an admittedly awesome moment of Rorschach punching a fat pervert.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Atomix,45,The first 15 minutes looked promising with an interesting combat system sealed by the Platinum Games experience the rest of the game is half cooked with random repetitive and boring elements that leaves this new Turtle’s adventure as a game that you will not have to play.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,47,Tries very hard to capture the atmosphere and style of the Dinotopia books but for the most part it just isnt a lot of fun to play.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Yahoo!,40,The ridiculous frustration in the early levels will deplete most gamers patience.
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,GamerWeb Sony,40,Lifeless and mundane hits atrocious control impossible scoring non-existent defense and offense set-ups and jerky flawed replays that happened WAY too fast and youve got a game that is seriously lacking in the gameplay category.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine,45,Over in just two to three hours. [Nov 2009 p.78]
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,GameSpot,43,The racing is boring and way too easy the physics are bouncy and unrealistic the rubber-band artificial intelligence is ridiculous and you can easily beat every race in the game in a couple hours.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,43,This is an incredibly slapdash and barren game that has absolutely nothing to offer you beyond monotonous almost-broken fighting mechanics tiny environments and a bunch of lame unlockables.
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GamingTrend,45,If this were a PSP game I may be able to overlook a lot of these short comings but as a PS3 game Last Rebellion is disappointing.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,SpazioGames,40,Chronovolt is definitely a really bad game not worth the amount of space occupied in your memory card.
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Ultimately despite its few hours of gory entertainment Ryder Whites an underwhelming add-on that wed recommend only to fervent Dead Island fans.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GamerWeb Sony,45,Although it does have some neat elements such as being able to play as the bad guy and several spell elements it doesnt make up for the lack of texture quality as well as the shaky framerate and bad camera.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Stuff,45,The disc doesnt do anything that every other third-person action game on the market does better.
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Life,40,AeternoBlade II is a mess of overly-complex mechanics and ill-fitting systems that struggles at all times to keep up with itself. Its core combat is solid but its marred by input lag slow animations messy enemy placement and a struggling framerate. The time-based mechanics are far too numerous confusing and tedious while its long and winding storyline – delivered by some of the worst voice-acting we’ve ever heard – is almost totally nonsensical. Somewhere under all of the technical problems and confusion here there’s a solid game but there’s just far too much jank for players to be expected to wade through to get there and its impossible to recommend that you commit yourself to trying.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,Nintenderos,45,Fimbul offers a boring and repetitive Nordic story accompanied by a graphic lag that directly affects the gameplay.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,PTGamers,45,Lacking co-op and the rest of the cast Beast Rider seems more like a market study than the complete Golden Axe experience we could expect.
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Nintendo Power,40,The gimmick of tilting the Wii Remote like handlebars is as engaging as this game gets. [Apr 2009 p.87]
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Gamers Europe,40,In summary I just cant recommend this because it has virtually no purpose and is horribly tedious - it says a lot that Sam Fox Strip Poker on the ZX Spectrum from 1986 actually had more of a point to playing it even if that point was just to see an awful monochrome drawing of a pair of oversized norks.
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,TheSixthAxis,40,I do admire the effort but in a year where Sonic Mania outdid its franchise’s reputation and Mario stands tall Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back is a mere afterthought. Its length is pathetically short and surprisingly for Bubsy at least the game is really easy. Not everything that could possibly go wrong did go wrong yet if this is the pinnacle of Bubsy games then the poor Bobcat should be laid to rest in peace.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Chronicles,40,This is not a game worth buying for anything other than the amusing oddity of having a Harry Potter-themed cover shooter. Its a short game but it still doesnt have the variety in environments that a shooter needs to avoid becoming unacceptably repetitive.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Worth Playing,40,A bargain basement title with more press than gameplay ... and where the only piracy practiced might be the time that it steals from your day.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,Thoroughly unambitious. [June 2008 p.96]
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,IGN,42,The single player portions of this game are not fun. The bot A.I. is erratic models occasionally disappear and reappear steps ahead and many of the games paintball guns are annoyingly inaccurate.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,GameSpy,40,Theres nothing outright horrific about Big Mutha Truckers 2; in extremely short bursts it can even be a bit of no-brainer fun. But theres too much thats underdeveloped and gruelingly tedious over the long haul.
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GamingTrend,44,I tend to review KOEI titles higher than some other reviewers as I have no interest in panning a game that people have put some effort into; on the surface this is not one of those games.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,GameZone,40,This is a game that had potential but that potential was not fully realized. The game is not terrible especially in a multiplayer setting but it just fails to connect in a truly long-lasting entertaining way.
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,GameSpot,45,Extremely difficult puzzles and a vague plot sink this ambitious Myst clone.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Multiplayer.it,50,Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark isnt nearly as good as the previous two episodes.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,XenGamers,58,It’s like Tetris only with... No wait. It’s just Tetris.
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GameSpot,47,Only die-hard fans of Acclaims long-running series should bother with this title.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,Attack of the Fanboy,50,Q*Bert Rebooted is definitely one character that deserved to be rebooted into todays gaming world but while it does retain many of the classic Q*Bert elements spotty controls and inexcusably bad load times make the game extremely mediocre.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,God is a Geek,50,The potential is actually staggering but the reach exceeds their grasp and in the end they’re left with a game that frankly underachieves in almost all the ways that matter.
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,VideoGamesLife,40,Yet another crap Army Men game only about as good as all of its many predecessors put together. Its quite ugly hard to control and really easy: its like your first girlfriend. Youll have fun with it for a couple of hours but after a day or so youll change your phone number and hope it doesnt go psycho.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,N-Insanity,44,Generally a frustrating game that will leave you crying tears of boredom after youre finished.
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Nintendo Life,40,Kids and kids-at-heart may get a thrill out of seeing dinosaurs kinda-sorta duke it out in 3D but the game itself fails to offer much beyond its really simple structure and fight mechanics both of which get old just a little too quick.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,Wccftech,45,Husk is a psychological horror game with broken combat and stealth systems that consistently undoes any sense of tension it tries so hard to build.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Impulsegamer,50,Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise is a step back from the first game with repetitive gameplay a lack of humour and some dodgy presentation and performance issues.
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,COGconnected,40,With a few more level types and a real change in difficulty other than needing better reflexes Johnny Kung Fu would have been entertaining for more than a weekend; as it stands now I would let Mr. Wang win this battle.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,Official Xbox Magazine,45,Charging 10 bucks for such a stellar board game in such shoddy wrapping should be illegal. [Apr 2009 p.79]
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Eurogamer,40,Mediocre unimpressive and uninspired. The handling and physics are competent but the missions are dull and the presentation is shoddy. The most fun to be had is in laughing at the voiceovers.
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,Nintendojo,40,Godzilla Unleashed does too many things poorly to be recommended to anyone but the most diehard of Godzilla fans who will be attracted to some of the games attempted fan service like the impressive roster of monsters.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer,49,Instead of spending $50 on Beowulf the game read the poem instead; this game isnt epic its just epically tedious. [Feb 2008 p.74]
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,PC Gamer UK,40,A cheap and soulless victim of its own lofty ambition. [Oct 2006 p.91]
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,PSX Nation,30,No sensation of speed in a snowboarding videogame = no fun!
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,44,Its a shame as what initially looked promising all those months ago when we first saw it is in fact one of the worst games on Live Arcade. Avoid.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,PSW Magazine UK,40,The PS2 game was never going to compete with the Xbox 360s graphics and neither did anyone expect it to. What we didnt anticipate was a completely dumbed down version that doesnt seem to know whether its a straightforward first-person shooter or a tactical war game.
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,PlayStation LifeStyle,40,By itself it lacks any real compelling reason to buy it.
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Game Chronicles,45,Due to bad camera bad AI bad combat and bad dialogue this game just isnt much fun to play.
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Digital Chumps,48,The games visuals are on par with other DS FPS titles out there and 1-4 player wireless download play is a nice addition for any DS game. However this game really has nothing more to get excited about as the dark and unrefined level design dull A.I. and flawed weapons make the game difficult to enjoy.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Informer,40,This tedious handheld port will do nothing to revive the franchises ailing reputation. [Nov 2003 p.178]
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,PC Gamer,44,A tiny bit of truly awful combat has been thrown in when it should have been thrown out and this may be the last third-person game in existence that doesn’t support the mouse in any way.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,44,The majority of missions have you destroying weapons and taking down terrorists. The bonus levels are just rehashes of things from single-player. Theres little to hold your attention for very long.
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,GamingTrend,45,Please don’t buy this game. Not for your kid not for you. It’s not worth it. Get them more cards or something. They won’t get anything out of this Yu-Gi-Oh game other than story.
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,GamerWeb Nintendo,45,While this game could have been a contender it falls flat onto its face.
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Gaming Age,42,A second rate boxing title that just cant cut it with K.O. Kings.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Deeko,40,This game is definitely not a good demonstration of what the camera is capable of and for people who didnt graduate from EyeToy University this game could be enough to put them off of motion-based gaming indefinately.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,It’s no surprise that a movie-licensed game has turned out rubbish again. There is no excuse for gameplay this dated. Avoid unless you’re feeling very nostalgic.
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,NintendoWorldReport,40,Vaccine isn’t a title I’d recommend even to the most fervent survival horror fans. There just isn’t enough variation to continue playing death after death. Stay away from this one.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,Games.cz,50,After a decade of Cortex Command development weve lived to see its final version. That alone is a cause to rejoice. Unfortunately you will be merry until the very moment when you find out the game is still a semi-finished product with a hint of great gameplay.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,45,In my younger years a kid who lived up the street lets call him Bad Pete had a bright idea involving some frozen Gobstopper candies and his paintball gun. The giant purple welts that followed were far FAR more painful than playing this game but not by much.
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,1UP,42,I hesitate to say that Iron Man is dumbed down for the Wii PlayStation 2 and PSP since hardware limitations likely necessitated such a distinct iteration but the resulting experience is a by-the-numbers affair unlikely to rouse most action fans.
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,TeamXbox,50,Playing this game alone borders on punishment so I stress the point that if you are a loser and do not have any friends; please steer clear of Blackstone and all its unholiness.
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Play UK,48,Released for free this would have been an interesting experiment – if still backed up with a boring chugging racing game. As it stands its the latter point mixed in with a £20-shaped slap in the face. Absolutely pointless.
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,Play UK,44,If you get it for nothing give it a half an hour. If you dont dont. [Issue#219 p.81]
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,YouGamers,45,Its no fun beating up on the little guy but whoever green-lighted the release of SunAge surely must have known that the release code was beta at best.
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,PlayStation Country,40,Submersed ultimately makes some key decisions which will frustrate. Enemies are relentless and inventory management feels botched leading to you require prior knowledge to advance. Stealth is functional but more often than not youre tasked with running from foes that are simply quicker and deadlier than you. Theres a punishment on offer here that doesnt fit the crime and whilst the game tries to do well with a small budget it cant execute on much of it.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,40,Sometime a good idea can shape-up a good game. Thats not the case. Multiplayer in Mindjack couldve saved the day but all the other stuff will give you only an enormous headache.
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Pure Xbox,40,Ironically Infinity Runner is too short for what it is. The gameplay is as repetitive as youd expect but the storyline and non-standard features alleviate that somewhat to the point that it can be entertaining enough at times.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,40,The career mode is insultingly linear short-lived and your progress through it is interspersed with cheesy live-action videos of people giving you mad props for kooking your way through. In addition when you take into account its sub-par visuals a physics system from four years ago and the ludicrous price of admission; RIDE is pure frustration made plastic. [Apr 2010 p.71]
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Cheat Code Central,40,In its defense the enemy AI is more intelligent than ones in your average shooter. If they were any more intelligent they would pick up and find a better game to play in. I advise you to do likewise.
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Adrenaline Vault,40,The unnecessarily tedious unit movement coupled with the debilitating difficulty level of many battles leaves this title stranded with too many moments of frustration for the average user.
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GamerWeb Sony,45,The level design is uninspired the controls ... well dont and the games sense of speed is nonexistent.
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,G4 TV,40,Suffers from a lack of replay value: Once you get the hang of its flawed controls it is possible to get a gold medal in each event within an hour or so of play leaving little reason to ever touch the game again.
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,DarkStation,40,Calvino Noir struggles to overcome problems of its own making. The controls are clunky and make the game more difficult than it needs to be. It fails at communicating its own mechanics so much so that your first interaction with the enemy very likely ends in a very surprising death.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,GamingExcellence,40,I would not recommend Tornado at all. It’s a decent concept (one we’ve seen before) but is executed in an extremely frustrating manner.
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,IGN,35,This title is outright disastrous. It was obviously released without thorough or perhaps any testing. The game is rife with design and performance problems and ultimately is unplayable.
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,We Got This Covered,40,The Bugs Life meets Contra premise of MilitAnt is promising but unfortunately the experience is marred by questionable design decisions and an unreliable targeting system.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Talk Xbox,42,For the little enjoyment being offered and problems that are present a 800 Microsoft point purchase just cannot be justified. There are too many negatives and scarce positives to be found.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Game Informer,43,In a game you need a control scheme that makes sense and works. Buffys doesnt. At all... Try as I might theres nothing that I can compliment or even remotely endorse in this game. [Sept 2003 p.126]
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,eToychest,40,Any kind of story or action present in the game is quickly drowned by the boring repetition that drags this title down like a quagmire.
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,All Game Guide,40,Not only is the control awkward and difficult to master levels are poorly designed and seemingly impossible to complete.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Games Master UK,43,A mildly rubbish shooter. [March 2016 p.80]
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,PSX-Sense.nl,40,A brave but ultimately failed attempt to reintroduce gamers to the Second World War. Awful AI disastrous level design weak textures... name a problem and this game will probably have it in abundance. Skip this.
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,InsideGamer.nl,43,Ive never played such a boring game as Terminator Salvation: The Videogame. The game is repetitive and the storytelling very shallow. Its a big plus that finishing the game will only take you about three to four hours. Even the very reasonable cover system cant let you enjoy this simple and boring movie game.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,41,Sadly you will battle nearly as many bugs as Nazis through the course of Turning Point. For all the game gets wrong which marks about ninety-eight percent of the game they deserve credit for at least writing a solid heroic ending to the game. The trick is plodding through four to five hours of bad to get to the thirty-seconds of goodness.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gameblog.fr,40,Rooted in good intentions but poorly executed.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Hot Games,40,Casual gamers should pass Danger Girl like a bad bowl of chili.
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,GameShark,42,If the game was a bit cheaper and clocked in at something like 400 points instead it might be a bit easier to recommend – but for 800 points Word Puzzle will definitely need some more content released to stay afloat.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Eurogamer Poland,40,Uninteresting combination of unpolished elements. The campaign quickly bores and multiplayer turns out to be only slightly less monotonous.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,RPGamer,40,Everreach: Project Eden somehow manages to avoid being as annoying to play as its constituent parts would indicate and there will be some out there who can get a decent evening or two’s entertainment from it. The game at least flows along quickly and the writing just about holds interest through the six or so hours it takes to see everything on offer. But this papering over fails to deal with the major underlying cracks and it remains one that is impossible to actively recommend.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,4Players.de,45,The hack&slay formula is simple. But Blood Knights doesn’t deliver. That this game and Venetica come from the same dev team is hard to believe.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,GameDaily,40,The turn-based battles that make up the bulk of the game are tedious and boring made worse by their constant bombardment upon the player. The story feels completely unimportant and its telling by the main characters is too cheesy to make anyone care.
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,45,The quests are uninteresting and the games 40 Thrilling Games (as touted by the box) are far from entertaining. I have many fond memories of Six Flags but Fun Park is not one of them.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,Eurogamer,40,Monster Jam is a terrible racing game and a laughable attempt at recreating the hefty impact of monster trucks to boot. With zero challenge and aggravating control I dont think MotorStorm 2 has much to worry about.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,45,For the most part the game is just boring with lackluster gameplay and reused environments and then it gets frustrating. Toss in issues I didnt even mention such as unresponsive weapons and repetitive music and I know I wouldnt want to suit up for this one.
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,40,Power Rangers Super Megaforce is completely uninspired but at least knows who it is trying to target and is adequately made. As a bit of fan service it succeeds in being connected to the show but as a game it is repetitive with half-realised ideas that could have made the experience more engaging but never really live up to their potential.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameZone,40,Quantum Theory looks and feels like an anime-inspired fan mod of Gears of War 1. While Im a devout supporter of doing things right the first time I wouldnt mind seeing a sequel that steps up its game makes better use of Filena and learns from the critical feedback the original received (which is nearly insurmountable at this point).
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gaming Nexus,40,Farming is no fun. You have to get up early you are constantly getting dirty you have to deal with unruly animals and it can be a thankless experience. In other words it sucks. This feeling of tedium and hopelessness is perfectly conveyed in Harvest in the Heartland.
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,Monotonous. [Issue#23 p.97]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameSpot,40,The Harry Potter film tie-ins end on a low note with this short tedious and conceptually vapid cover shooter.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Jeuxvideo.com,40,Electronic Arts has basically published FIFA 19 on Switch labelling it FIFA 20. FIFA 19 can be bought at a much cheaper price and offers the same content.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,PC Gamer,45,All the gameplay ingredients are here but a complete lack of seasoning makes this one dish that should be tossed down the disposal. [Oct 2004 p.98]
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,PlayStation Country,40,Theres a fun game buried away inside Spuds Uneartheds needlessly complicated exterior but even when you figure out whats going on a chronic lack of challenge kills the game before it ever really gets going.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,Dealspwn,40,Hatred delivers some fleeting sadistic satisfaction and a gorgeous art style but quickly becomes a tedious chore. After all the controversy its disappointing that the finished product is mechanically flawed and otherwise completely forgettable.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN,40,There are few solid gameplay elements such as some clever use of Rita’s grappling hook but the overall feel of the game screams rush job from nearly every angle. The music is generic the VO is repetitive the overall presentation is extremely bland and the gameplay is chalk full of quirky execution.
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Eurogamer Italy,40,New Gundam Breaker is like a dream come true for GunPla collectors... and a nightmare for those who pretends it to be a decent Mobile Suit videogame.
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Play.tm,45,If you are a big fan of darts and watch it religiously then I can see this game being right up your street especially during the months when its not on the television. But for those of you out there that occasionally have a session with your pals down the pub then I suggest you stick with the traditional way of playing darts and avoid this title.
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Eurogamer Spain,40,Short boring and not very inspired. This is exactly what we feared about Move: a rerun of Wiis worst mistakes.
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,Nintendo Life,40,The gameplay is passable and there is a high level of challenge for completionists but the title falls over in almost every other area.
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,games(TM),40,Erase those memories of halcyon days spent nurturing your arthritis with the original coin-op because Streetwise does it no kind of justice. [May 2006 p.124]
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IncGamers,40,Unfortunately Zathura plays like it was won in a car boot sale. Avoid.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Wccftech,50,I dont hate The Elder Scrolls: Blades at least conceptually. Bethesdas lightweight F2P Elder Scrolls game has all the hallmarks of the franchise but delivers them all in such a hollow way that it loses everything that makes the franchise beloved. You might find some enjoyment in the game as I have done but you will inevitably become weary of the dungeons frustrated with the timers and on Nintendo Switch you will find the performance to be at times unbearable. Fans of The Elder Scrolls deserve better than this but its all they will get until The Elder Scrolls VI launches years from now.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Gamereactor Denmark,40,One of the most meager party games weve seen in a while.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gamer 2.0,40,The most enjoyable part of the game would have to be the unlockable Public Service Announcements from the old cartoon show. But chances are you could save the cash and look them up online. And trust us you would be very well served by saving that cash.
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,The most muddled and irritating Sonic game yet. [May 2007 p.110]
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,PSX-Sense.nl,40,Hardly original and poorly executed Super Dungeon Bros could have been a lot of fun were it not for the annoying bugs slow controls and unforgiving difficulty. Shame.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,40,The occasional turn-based tactical shootout could’ve injected some much-needed verve but the arbitrarily frugal placement of cover points too often forces your thugs to stand out in the open and questionable line-of-sight will make you curse the inability to save in the middle of an engagement.
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,IGN,45,The developer worked to get the looks and sounds of the console version on the GBA but they didnt capture the gameplay.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Happy Puppy,45,In and out of the ring this products nothing more than a jobber staring down the most brutal tag team ever to represent the sport: WWF Wrestlemania 2000 and WWF Royal Rumble.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameTrailers,45,The Clone Wars is easily one of the least entertaining parts of the Star Wars mythology Yodas constant tongue-tied tutorials are more troublesome than a Dagobah skinny-dip and the whole game feels like a pale imitation of the superior Lego series.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,GamingTrend,45,There are some decent things going on in Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z. The cel-shaded art style is appealing the dialogue and cutscenes are occasionally entertaining and even the combat is fun at times. But the frustrating camera aggravating controls and a nonsensical story that only briefly touches upon the themes of the series weigh this spinoff title down too much for it to be enjoyable.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,45,This game is essentially a bargain bin Xbox game and it is insulting to see it with a regular Xbox 360 game price tag.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameSpot,40,The Harry Potter film tie-ins end on a low note with this short tedious and conceptually vapid cover shooter.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,n-Revolution Magazine UK,41,Something so workmanlike out of something that was so very inventive. [Issue#19 p.88]
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,IGN,40,Its time to let Myst die. It had its run and now its time for the game to finally stop appearing everywhere. Even when its free Myst is barely worth playing so charging $30 for a portable version is just ridiculous especially since the port absolutely ruins the game.
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,4Players.de,45,The game design is as flat as the pretty ladies are curvy. A totally irrelevant collection of minigames with a hint of Tamaogotchi. But not even the boob bonus can save this beach vacation.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,Vandal,40,If you played Octodad you know that having bad unresponsive controls on purpose can be funny. Surgeon Simulator tries that but it does it in a way that makes you think the controls are broken. It isnt fun but frustrating. The team has promised a patch to fix this so you might want to wait for it before buying it.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Happy Puppy,55,Oh I forgot to mention the horribly painful control and the truly pathetic graphics. Yep definitely a Cruisn title.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Computer and Video Games,40,With only two way multiplayer returning this really was a missed opportunity to improve upon a disappointing franchise. As it stands BW2 gets the smack put down on it by virtually every other fighter out there. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,New Game Network,45,Youll want to steer clear of Dead Alliance especially at its ridiculous $40 price tag. There is a decent game buried here but digging through the bugs shallow gameplay and underwhelming mechanics is just not worth it. If you simply love FPS and are quite fond of the idea of weaponized zombies at least wait until a big price reduction a number of major patches or give it a rental.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,GameSpot,40,There are so many problems with Will of Steel that its hard to know where to begin in terms of describing them but trust us when we say to spare yourself the frustration and avoid this decidedly lackluster game.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Metro GameCentral,40,The whole idea was probably doomed from the start but this is a disappointingly slipshod effort with a story campaign that somehow feels more old-fashioned than the decades-old movie it’s based on.
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,Eurogamer Portugal,30,The younger ones may even feel captivated for some time but they should not endure something so boring for long.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PS3bloggen.se,40,Many parts of this game seems to be rushed during development. Poor controls and that camera is pretty annoying. On the good sides are the epic music and those great voice actors.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,MS Xbox World,35,If you really must play Tron then by all means but dont say I didnt warn you as the appeal wears off pretty quickly.
Farscape: The Game,PC,Aug-8-2002,Red Lemon Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,eToychest,40,The control is passable following a Diablo-esque click-move-click again-move schema. Boring but sufficient.
Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,IGN,44,Its got the heroes but none of their charm. And its yet another example of the Justice League idea never reaching its potential as a game...at least on the handheld side of things.
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,Multiplayer.it,45,While Gardening Mama tries to improve the classic minigame formula by building a sort of structure with some managerial features the result is a shallow uninventive and interesting... classic minigame formula kind of title.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Gamer.no,40,Ben 10: Omniverse is first and foremost a disappointing game with a developer apparently afraid to take any gameplay or story risks with one of Cartoon Networks most popular franchises. The fun and colourful visual design does little to make up for the uninspired brawler based gameplay and wholly uninteresting story.
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,PALGN,45,The game becomes repetitive and boring after just half an hour and the gameplay is just too dull.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Xbox Evolved,40,This brings shame to the name Turtles. Even to the Turtles die hard fans this will just be a stab in your heart.
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Level7.nu,40,Messing around and being violent in a bear infested game world is fun for a while. The same thing goes for the games humor. When the initial wave of entertainment is over youre left with bad gameplay mechanics and repetitive content. Despite an initially entertaining tone this content is not worth the asking price.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,A conversation so watered down its hard to find where the good game has gone. [June 2008 p.96]
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Game Revolution,42,This title may be worth the rental to test the waters but save your real money for another racer as this one is covered in mud.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Destructoid,45,If youre a die-hard fan of the Transformers film series I would recommend picking up Rise of the Dark Spark when its heavily discounted (like under $10) with a group of friends just to play Escalation.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Twinfinite,40,Funk of Titans is a game full of missed opportunities and it’s really a shame. The game has a solid premise that would be good for some great laughs and varied gameplay it just never seems to deliver.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,4Players.de,42,Quotation forthcoming.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Vietnam usually makes for a fresh theatre of gaming war but in the hands of Games Farm it turns out to be quite unexceptional. Suitable for killing time but nothing more. [Nov 2013]
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Gamekult,40,Quotation forthcoming.
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,Nintendo Life,50,Fast Draw Showdown is one of those games you just want to enjoy. If you should find yourself hosting a party one day but have no party games on your Wii to play then rest assured that this game mixes well with friends and moonshine. However it is otherwise not quick enough on the draw to earn its place in video game history.
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,IGN,43,NBA Live’s flaccid return is made all the more disappointing because we waited three years for it. After all that time NBA Live 14 in no way advances the basketball sim genre and worse leaves little to be optimistic about for next year.
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,45,If this series were to receive a significant upgrade – perhaps via the DW: Gundam sequel – it could finally move beyond its troubled past. For now unfortunately it is stuck in a dated mechanically-challenged form that is all but impossible to enjoy.
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,Yahoo!,40,Were the character control tighter level designs a bit more varied and the sound a bit less repetitive it could have been a great way to waste some time with old favorites.
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,COGconnected,38,Sure your child may get an hour of two of cheap thrills but simply put there are far better family oriented Kinect games already on the market that offer much more content replay value and are simply much more polished.
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Gaming Nexus,42,Naughty Bear works as a crazy idea but not as a full-priced video game.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,4Players.de,42,This is absolutely no competition for Uncharted. The fights are boring and bugs ruin the remaining fun. Which is a pity because the vistas and solid puzzles give a glimpse of what this game could have been.
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GamerNode,40,I wanted to like this game--I just couldnt. Whether its the fault of the changes from the Japanese to American version or the minigames themselves something just never clicks.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer,40,I realise first person shooters are getting shorter these days but come on. Did Saber Interactive really imagine that releasing a movie tie-in that you can sleepwalk through inside an hour was going to be acceptable?
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,DarkStation,40,This game is a pretty clear cut disappointment and there is really no other way to say it. It had the potential to be a sleeper hit paving the way for action games on the PSP but ultimately let down with an uninspired storyline and lackluster gameplay.
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,BaziCenter,45,WWE 2K20 is flat out worst entry in the series period. The game is obviously unfinished and is full of bugs and glitches and there is almost no way that even the die hard fans of WWE can enjoy it. WWE 2K series seems to be done for this generation and we can only hope that the new developers will have something to offer on next generation of consoles.
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Meristation,40,Cheap science-fiction lame story and a not-fun gameplay system. Were still wondering why Square Enix wanted to develop an action-paced game without any kind of meaning at all just a copy & paste of games like Gears of War and Uncharted. Nothing interesting here better wait for something thats worthy of our attenttion.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,XGN,45,ENKI is a game that tries to deliver a replayable horror game but does not really succeed in doing that. The game is far too short for its price and the randomisation makes the game annoying more than replayable. Because of that ENKI fails to convince.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Next Generation Magazine,40,Few things are more tedious than a sprawling RPG without any real wit style or engaging characters. [Dec 2001 p.108]
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,DC Swirl,40,Go in peace son as your indiscretion with yet another Acclaim-sponsored disappointment has been forgiven... again!
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Cheat Code Central,40,Once I had committed a few hours to the game and was deep inside Venice leveling up and completing quests I was indeed drawn into the game. But the sordid path it took to get me there and the unnecessary complications of the map were beyond frustrating and would turn away most gamers.
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,Vandal,40,Fans of the series will have a hard time trying to enjoy this game since it’s a repetitive and tedious experience that will fall behind the outstanding games the handheld is showcasing.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,PC Gamer,38,If desiging and producing games was really as boring as Game Tycoon makes it wed all be playing Zork. [July 2006 p.99]
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,IGN,38,Flying is fun the upgrades are neat and the game can look good. However these pros are outweighed by the aforementioned frustration crappy storyline and lame cutscenes.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,45,For the most part the game is just boring with lackluster gameplay and reused environments and then it gets frustrating. Toss in issues I didnt even mention such as unresponsive weapons and repetitive music and I know I wouldnt want to suit up for this one.
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Format,46,A great idea thats failed because of execution. [May 2009 p.96]
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Edge Magazine,40,Star Trek has more bugs crawling on it than a Fear Factor contestant. Sometimes the results are amusing as in the turbolift example but frequently they just make life a drag.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,The Games Machine,35,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle is wrong on so many levels: the gameplay is boring and repetitive the content is basically MIA the graphics are old and inadequate. The concept couldve worked but well it doesnt. If youre a fan of the saga better stick to the classics (or at least Touhou Genso Wanderer).
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameShark,40,It would be cool to have a Splinter Cell or Metal Gear type game on the GBA but Mission: Impossible - Operation Surma isnt it. Decline the mission and disavow any knowledge of this games existence.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Cheat Code Central,40,The only thing this game has going for it is the novelty of creating your own hybrids of dinosaurs.
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,ActionTrip,50,Although you will be involved in an interesting and chilling story theres really nothing more to grab your attention throughout the game. Not to mention it took me less than two days to complete the entire game.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,PSM3 Magazine UK,40,It feels like a clone of The Godfather but nowhere near on the same level in terms of depth and enjoyment. [Jan 2007 p.81]
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,G4 TV,40,The camera is even worse than in the main mode -- odd when it couldve just taken a zoomed-in version of the isometric view that games like Baldurs Gate have used for eons.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,GameSpot,40,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is full of things that make you go hmm. Why do midlevel checkpoints update your score but not save your game forcing you to restart from the beginning if both characters die? If youre going to steal from Gears of War why steal the slow-walking earpiece-cradling mission updates?
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,Jeuxvideo.com,50,It was probably developed with the best intentions in mind but Fear Effect Sedna remains crippled by technical defects and gameplay problems which always draw us out of the game experience.
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Cubed3,40,It is a good idea from Enjoy Gaming but sadly the limited customisation options mean games will usually end up roughly the same. For £3.60 this isnt a bad buy if 3DS owners are looking for a game that contains classic puzzle themes and has a reasonable game editor thrown in but for most people Block Factory simply will not be worth the time or money.
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,The Digital Fix,40,Rather than the suave impressive chat-up line it could so easily have been Time and Eternity instead sashays up to feminism and blurts ‘I like your boobs’ like Seth Rogen’s menacing delivery in Donnie Darko. It could be a misjudged line but it’s not attractive and it’s not funny. It’s just plain creepy.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Nintendo Power,56,The game lets you face off with another player (using two controllers) but the single-player optoins dont offer CPU competition. [March 2005 p.107]
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Your moves are clumsy and unresponsive. Arenas wear you out rather than challenge you. Boss battles are overwrought and underwhelming. The God at the climax of the Land of the Dead is defeated by a drawn-out process of ranged health-whittling and dodge-rolling.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,AceGamez,40,I personally wouldnt recommend ArchLord to anyone; there are much better games out there and much better ways to waste a few hundred hours or so.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Jeuxvideo.com,45,Evolving from the gun’n’run type to the shoot’em up genre Contra Rogue Corps misses too many shots. Everything looks like it’s 10 years late from visuals to gameplay mechanics and sound design.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,God is a Geek,40,Nickelodeon Kart Racers is just about a passable karting game. It feels rushed and bland meaning theres little here to inspire you for very long.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,GamePro,50,Its too bad the play mechanics are not more engaging especially given the potential of the Wii-motion controls. But as is the range of mini-missions and quests you lead the precocious Coraline through will feel familiar to anyone whos played any number of average film-tied titles.
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,IncGamers,40,I should probably have undergone some therapy before writing this review as the game left me frustrated beyond belief.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Cheat Code Central,40,While this game will take you twenty or more hours to complete it is so repetitious and clunky youll swear it was closer to eighty.
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,Game Chronicles,42,I love the concepts story and gameplay ideas behind Brave but they just aren’t executed in a fashion that is remotely playable or enjoyable especially if you have played anything better.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Quotation Forthcoming
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,42,Although Turning Point had an interesting storyline it still ends up being an incredibly limited and generic WWII shooter.
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Game Chronicles,55,Although you will wonder why Log Cutting is a family game you’ll have too much fun to really care. If you don’t have anyone to play with then the fun in this game will quickly diminish but this game will surely bring families together.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameDaily,40,SPRay had potential but its just another bad third party Wii game.
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,PLAY! Zine,40,Short and boring with a story that is to put it simply - bad historical fiction.
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,DarkStation,40,In its current form I simply cannot recommend Hello Neighbor to anyone until all of the problems are fixed. Again I am shocked and disappointed that publisher tinyBuild would charge $30 for a product that clearly needs a lot more work. It really sucks because this game has a few things that work well like its unique mechanics a great art style and good measured horror. There’s a glimmer of something neat but right now its best to treat this as Hello Neighbor Game Preview Edition.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Nintendojo,40,A good strategy game will stretch the mind here and there. In theory tactics should be applicable with actual results. In the simplest terms strategy games should require strategy to play. Perhaps Konami thought they could slide by being the only new game in town.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,40,Stranger is one of strangest games of this year. Or any other year for that matter.
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Above all Rock Revolution just doesnt have the charm or depth of its rivals. [Christmas 2008 p.111]
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,ZTGD,40,MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore is a bad game. This hurts me considering I have been an avid fan of Rainbow’s titles since the PS2 era.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,GameZone,45,Remember that attractive animated style that made Wallace and Gromit so easy on the eyes? Lets just say things havent been quite so pretty for the CSI folks.
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,GamePro,40,Throw in some very uneven game presentation - nice graphics poor instruction manual and plug-your-ears-annoying soundtrack - and gamers are presented with a title that not even the in-game appearance of Wesley Snipes could make appealing.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,40,This was an ambitious production but it boils down to sluggish platforming and repetitive fetch quests. [June 2010 p78]
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,GameShark,40,Despite the chaos you can create everything happens at the same time for the same reasons. There will always be a cop car with its lights on at this corner; that boat will always be there at this time etc.
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,PSX Nation,35,Bland and boring this is a game to avoid unless you are the most rabid of ATV racing fans tanked out of your mind on Schlitz and have precious little else to do.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GamePro,40,Coupled with the terrible combat the game is only 2 hours long.
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,The Digital Fix,40,A decade ago Arcania would be a pretty decent RPG. Time has not been friendly to this game and repackaging something that was never a classic to begin with is a misguided move.
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,PSM3 Magazine UK,38,Basically this is a hugely simplified pointless and weird version of Power Stone. So get that instead. [Feb 2007 p.78]
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,Digital Chumps,40,Some believe sports games to be one of the easiest games to develop and difficult to get wrong and then something like TWT comes around and proves that even something as straightforward as tennis can go awry.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Extreme Gamer,45,I can not recommend Science of Evil on the PSP if you want a good Hellboy experience pick up a comic or check out the film.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,45,After three hours (if you can make it that far) of crappy controls mediocre visuals and boring and generally unimaginative gameplay youll actually be glad to have finished the game so you can return it or burn it and move on with your life.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,GameBiz,45,Shattered Universe takes that one episode and turns it into an entire game with minor references to a few other Star Trek episodes.
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,Gaming Age,42,The Wii game was disappointing at best. The controls arent problematic which is the best thing I can say and something that should be expected coming from High Voltage but everything else about the game just screams quick movie cash-in.
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Honestly no one will want to play this for more than 10 minutes. [July 2009 p.81]
Deca Sports 3,Wii,Oct-26-2010,Hudson | NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Sports | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,40,No matter how many modes the game claims to have Deca Sports 3 is too poorly designed to be entertaining and when your standard motion controls are better than the enhanced MotionPlus controls something is horribly wrong here.
Rugby 18,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Koch Media,Sports | Team | Rugby,Push Square,40,Though Eko Software has tried to give virtual rugby a breath of life – and in some ways with a revamped control and camera system it has – the lack of modes and dismal presentation leave a bad taste in the mouth. At full-price Bigben is demanding an obscene amount of money for a game that feels years behind where it should be.
Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Gamer's Hell,47,Legacy: Dark Shadows just isn’t fun. It tries so hard to mimic great adventure games like that of The Longest Journey but sadly only does so graphically which isn’t a good thing.
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,Media and Games Online Network,40,This is a pretty bad game that has endless sprawling caves as gameplay areas and equally dull gameplay within them.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,40,The score is deceptive. There are worse superhero games you could be playing. In the end though there arent any secrets that dont apply to gamplay so theres not much reason to revisit this.
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,GameSpot,40,Its unfortunate however that the number of bugs infesting it make things so problematic and frustrating. The games spooky ambiance and appealing nature are enjoyable but not enough to overshadow the humdrum puzzle solving nor to distract you from glitches.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,IGN,40,Nothing about Things on Wheels is very good. The single-player mode is boring the game looks like it was supposed to come out years ago (which it was) and the attempt at a story is poorly implemented and even more poorly written.
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,GameZone,45,This game is not worth your money or even the time it takes to download it. Not having the ability to play against another human is a huge strike to this game. Bottom line is to avoid this game.
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Games Master UK,42,About as much fun as a Transformer that converts into a lump of coal. Give it a miss. [Sept 2010 p.99]
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Gamers' Temple,38,25 to Life just doesnt have anything going for it that warrants a look at the game unless youre gangsta obsessed or bored out of your mind after playing every other available Xbox game out there. Save yourself the frustration and spend your gaming dollars elsewhere.
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,Absolute Games,30,The only difference between this game and the horrendous Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods is that its almost bug-free.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GamePro,40,The PSP version however has this incredibly unfun dual-pronged fork-in-the-eye problem of too many pokey load breaks paired with one...h-ell of a...won---ky fra-me...rate. There were so many times until I got used to it that I thought the game was just going to crash altogether.
Damnation,PC,May-22-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Total PC Gaming,40,Damnations good ideas are unfortunately never matched by its rough unfinished and unsatisfying execution. [Issue#21 p.56]
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,DS,Jun-17-2008,Farmind Ltd,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Worth Playing,40,It actually left me frustrated because it manages to do a lot right but ultimately its too lacking in too many areas to be something I can recommend.
One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,Game Informer,40,One Way Trip is a bore from beginning to end. I was never invested in its story despite trying to force myself to be and was instead either bored or annoyed the entire time. Relief washed over me when the credits finally rolled.
Alien Blast: The Encounter,PC,Feb-9-2004,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Cheat Code Central,40,If youre anything like me you wont be able to play it for any length of time unless youve got something on your mind that youre concentrating on that is far removed from the game. Its perfect for zoning out.
Robot Arena,PC,Apr-1-2001,Gabriel Interactive,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Breeding/Constructing,Yahoo!,40,The robot construction is simplistic in the extreme the arenas are forgettable and the actual combat is the epitome of boredom.
Rally Challenge 2000,Nintendo 64,Jun-30-2000,Europress,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Electric Playground,40,Bringing gamers a sense of nostalgia may be alright in space shooters and RPGs but in a racing game especially in the visuals department it just isn’t right.
Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,NintendoWorldReport,40,Emergency Heroes feels very rushed since theres just not much to it. The entire game took me approximately four hours from start to finish and that’s four hours too many for something as generic and repetitive as this.
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,Eurogamer Germany,40,Nonetheless keep your chin up Emobi Games. The first step has been made. 7554 brought Vietnam on the map of games developers. The next step is an actually good game. And you´ll get there. Someday.
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Worth Playing,40,How can a game this bland and uninteresting compete with the likes of Excite Truck and Need for Speed: Carbon let alone the scores of racers available on other consoles? Simply put it can’t; and it should be avoided at all costs.
Timeline,PC,Nov-12-2000,Timeline Computer Entertainment,Action | General | General,GameSpot,42,When the game is over which is very quickly youll hardly remember a thing about it.
MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,IGN,40,While the subject matter is full of exciting potential the imprecise controls and repetitive movements across events keep Motionsports Adrenaline from becoming a hit.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Wii,Nov-16-2010,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Nintendo Life,30,With seven months until the release of Part 2 we can only hope that EA learn from their mistakes here and step things up for Harrys grand finale.
The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,35,Even if you were completely charmed by Philip Pullmans work or enjoyed the movie adaptation theres absolutely no reason to give this game a try. Even the music as pretty as it is cant redeem such poor gameplay and atrocious presentation.
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Push Square,40,Gungrave VR has a poorly implemented control scheme a lack of story content it doesn’t take advantage of the technology available in the PSVR headset and ultimately lacks enjoyment in its core gameplay. Unfortunately Gungrave VR has failed to raise the series from the grave and we’d advise everyone to let this one lay to rest.
Waking,PC,Jun-18-2020,Jason Oda,Action | General,TheSixthAxis,50,Waking is a fascinating experiment that tries but ultimately fails to combine two radically different ideas together. Less would certainly have been more here as the clunky and overly confusing action parts get in the way of the interesting narrative and psychological aspects. While I was drawn in by the central conceit and the use of meditation the end result is more likely to leave you in a coma than drag you into the light.
JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,Trickstar Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Eurogamer Germany,40,Before I play Janes Advanced Strike Fighters again Id rather have another go at HAWXs 2. And that is not something I say lightly.
Taito Legends Power-Up,PSP,May-17-2007,Empire Oxford,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Play.tm,35,To put it simply if the idea of thirty very simple arcade games with no real objective other than good old fashioned high score setting appeals and you can put up with the strained atmosphere of craziness then you may get some fun out of this well presented but ultimately flawed collection.
Rapala Tournament Fishing!,Wii,Nov-22-2006,MagicWand,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Gamestyle,40,So the answer is that there is no worthwhile experience in Rapala Tournament Fishing to be discovered.
DARK,PC,Jul-3-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,IGN,40,Dark is a stealth action adventure thats brimming with good ideas but poor AI a weak story and repetitive gameplay drive a three-pronged stake through the heart of its entertainment value. Darks cel-shaded settings occasionally allow the otherwise drab experience to shine but not without a forgettable protagonist and clunky movements sinking their fangs into the fun.
Seduce Me,PC,Jan-2-2013,None,Strategy | General | General,Armchair Empire,40,The game itself doesnt possess enough personality (or challenge) on its own to stand out as unique in the admittedly small field of AO games.
Lets Fish! Hooked On,PlayStation Vita,Jan-29-2013,SIMS,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Pocket Gamer UK,40,Lets Fish! Hooked On is not the fishing game you are looking for on account of its glitchy repetitive play.
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,PC,Oct-17-2006,Apeiron,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | General | Modern,Worth Playing,40,New Jagged Union is not merely a bad game when compared to its peers but it is a bad game when compared to any titles released in the last several years. I cannot in good faith advise any fan of tactical strategy to make this a purchase.
Turtle Tale,3DS,May-22-2014,Saturnine Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,40,Turtle Tale winds up being a game that shows some promise for fans of retro action platformers but the lack of depth and variety create an experience where fun gives way to repetition far too quickly.
Street Supremacy,PSP,Feb-28-2006,Genki,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,DarkStation,40,With the street racing genre having done to death already this copycat is a lazy port of the poor Dreamcast racer. If youre looking for a quality title look elsewhere.
Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,GameWatcher,40,Without the nostalgia factor its just a very short and dated experience with a glimmer of the wonder that once gripped the arcade world. Thats really not enough to compete with whats out there now.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Gamenikki,40,The recipient of the Coaster of the Year award. Beer steins everywhere are smiling.
101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix,Wii,Jan-13-2011,Nordcurrent,Sports | General | General,N-Europe,50,Too many sports spoil the broth.
007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Informer,40,Its a bad game when its working but there are plenty of moments that make you wonder how it even got cleared for release. Enemy AI frequently freaks out causing soldiers to endlessly sprint against walls (often firing their guns at the ground). At one point the framerate dropped to unplayable levels except it wasnt during a firefight – I was just walking around.
Mall Tycoon,PC,Feb-3-2002,Holistic Design | Inc.,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gamers' Temple,40,While this might seem to be a mall rats dream Mall Tycoon falls short of the mark as either a business simulation or a shopping center builder.
Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project,Xbox 360,Jun-23-2010,3D Realms,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Horizontal,Extreme Gamer,45,Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project is going to appeal to a very niche market of gamers mainly the ones who have found memories of playing the original Duke games or even this 2D offshoot.
Clash of the Titans,PlayStation 3,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Eurogamer Portugal,40,The negative aspects are rather abundant in Clash of the Titans so this isnt something recommendable unless you are really fans of hack n slash and no longer have anything to play.
0 Day Attack on Earth,Xbox 360,Dec-23-2009,Gulti,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Target,40,Twin stick shooter fans have many other places to look to get their fix on the XBLA and almost all of them would be a better choice than 0 Day.
Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,PlayStation Universe,40,The best thing about Iron Man 2 are the cut scenes where some competent writing and voice acting makes the game seem like it just might be worth ploughing through even though it isn’t.
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,PlayStation Universe,40,Dollhouse takes good ideas and puts them behind clashing mechanics. The randomly-generated landscapes all look the same causing many issues with navigating and retrieving much-needed items. This pool of ideas lacks cohesion and the minuscule payoff makes the tedium feel like a complete waste of time. Very little works in Dollhouses favor.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,GameBiz,46,It contains nothing special and brings nothing new to the genre meaning it falls below the other better Combat Flight Simulators out there.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Nintendo Life,30,Unfortunately Nickelodeon Kart Racers is simply not good; derivative mechanics a pathetic character roster and awful performance make this a bargain bin experience that you’ll be glad you missed. If you absolutely have to play a racing game with Nickelodeon characters then by all means go ahead but we’d highly recommend you take a pass on this sorry effort.
Way of the Dogg,Xbox 360,May-3-2013,Echo Peak,General | Action | General,Meristation,40,Way of the Dogg is a laziest branded game of the year. It has some nice ideas but the execution isnt good at all.
4PM,PC,Jul-9-2014,Bojan Brbora,Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,4Players.de,38,The filmmakers’ interactive experiment fails on a variety of levels: technically mechanically and most disappointing when it comes to storytelling.
WWII Aces,Wii,Mar-21-2008,Arcade Moon,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Cheat Code Central,44,A long campaign doesnt help if the gameplay itself is intrinsically bad. Poor graphics partially shoddy controls boring objectives and frustrating repetitive missions make WWII Aces one to steer clear from unless youre a glutton for punishment.
Delta Force: Xtreme 2,PC,May-27-2009,NovaLogic,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,IGN,48,The only thing thats xtreme about this game is how extremely mediocre it is. The missions are uninspired the authenticity is lacking the servers are under-populated but hey at least it looks dated right?
Slain!,PC,Mar-24-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN Spain,40,We can only think on what Slain! could have been and cry.
Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Hooked Gamers,40,Stealth games are meant to be challenging and should feel like a tense punishing experience. But Alekhine’s Gun is stretch too far and instead punishes you because of its poor mechanics and terrible AI.
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,GameSpot,37,Tank Beat isnt much fun. Theres very little to it and what is there is bland and simplistic. If theres one feat developer MileStone managed to pull off its how dull it managed to make the act of blowing up tanks. That might be a fascinating accomplishment but it makes for an utter bore of a game.
The Polar Express,GameCube,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,38,Just dont come running back to us if little Johnny decides he hates you and moves out aged six when he finds this under his Christmas tree.
Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,Nintendo Insider,39,To the game’s credit the constantly progressing storyline and environments do give Around the World in 80 Days some pizzazz but it can’t completely hide the repetitive rudimentary gameplay.
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,IGN,38,The suckage wasnt just saved for the visual and auditory portion of Hail to the King though...no no. Gameplay is equally as tedious.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Truly sub-standard. [Aug 2010 p.105]
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,Multiplayer.it,45,The Chaos Engine comes as a mere re-release of the original shooter from 1993 without any remastering nor extra options.
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendo Insider,35,One of the most disappointing and lackluster games on the GameCube today...No matter what type of gamer you are though there are many flaws in the game which are inexcusable – the game’s length lack of challenge (apart from Survival Mode) monotony and bad graphics and sound.
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,Nintendo Power,46,The difficulty level is a tad high for young players and the gameplay is very repetitive. [Jan 2004 p.160]
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,IGN,27,This thing is a real banana in the tailpipe of Dreamcast racing. Stay far far away...it may be contagious.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,We Got This Covered,40,Ace Banana isn’t a total trainwreck and might be a fun diversion for younger players for a while but there’s a chance that even they will ultimately come away frustrated.
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,GamesRadar+,40,The cities are huge and beautiful with country-appropriate cars and while the gameplay is muddy it’s easy to see how it could have been better. But as it is DRIV3Ris all flash and little substance.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,The weirdest floatiest controls imaginable. [Feb 2008 p.94]
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Worth Playing,40,If you are a hardcore action shooter fan you may be insulted by the total lack of challenge or variation in the gameplay and if you are not there is nothing here to attract you to this uninspired generic disappointment. This is one confession that should have stayed within the family.
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,FNintendo,40,The overall difficulty level is low and will not pose any problem for players with a bit of experience which inadvertently ends up throwing the game against the expectations of its target audience of players longing for RPGs from the early 1990s. Chronus Arc ends up falling significantly below its potential in several fields.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamesRadar+,40,WayForward’s second Adventure Time game fails to marry the imagination of the Cartoon Network series with a top-down dungeon crawler resulting in a lifeless quest that does neither the cartoon nor the genre any justice.
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,n-Revolution Magazine UK,36,It may be one of the best of its breed but thats like saying smallpox is the best communicable disease. [Issue#22 p.74]
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GameFocus,36,There is no real value in this title because of the control gameplay and difficulty issues. If a patch was released with a control upgrade for the classic controller and to fix other issues I would say the game would be worth buying but not at the moment.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Jolt Online Gaming UK,38,A lot of the good intentions in Psychotoxic are just lost in the mess of it all. We might have recommended the story to fans of sci-fi B-movies but frankly after a few interesting cut-scenes the story goes absolutely nowhere for hours before wrapping-up in a not-entirely-satisfying manner.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PC Zone UK,32,If you want something to put on the box Mr. Marketing Man try this: This is so bad it is like beating old ladies to death with hammers.

Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,Nintendo Gamer,47,Tables are too squished on the DS screen making the balls seem massive but using the stylus to direct the cue and set power is pretty effective. [Apr 2007 p.70]
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Adrenaline Vault,40,With clearly low production values this game is ultimately quite boring. Dreary drudgery is what you have to slog through to get to the end and believe me it is just not worth it.
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GamesRadar+,40,We can’t think of any good reason to spend time with Eureka 7 Vol. 2. Even if the story intrigues you you’ll have to suffer through the rest of the game to see it. It’s just not worth it.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Eurogamer,40,Whats most frustrating is that with more enemies more graceful control and a more compelling structure theres no reason why a retro-styled Adventure Time roguelike couldnt have been an absolute treat and a game worthy of the show.
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpot,36,This simplistic brawlers condescending attitude and one-note gameplay make it worth dodging.
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PlayStation Universe,40,Painkiller: Hell & Damnation is an old-school FPS that is sadly dated boring and tedious to play.
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,DarkZero,40,The game is all about making more money to progress but the grind to get it is monotonous meaning most will lose the will to toil away on the farm long before getting access to the bigger better machinery.
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,Cheat Code Central,40,I’m going to be honest with you I haven’t finished Escape Dead Island yet. I just can’t bring myself to. The game plods along at a snail’s pace and just never hooks you. It’s certainly not the worst game I have ever played but it’s bland and generic and feels rushed and unfocused.
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,40,Inner Chains is a title that you would expect to find in Early Access given the many issues that affect it.
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,NZGamer,45,Theres nothing to save this shambles and no way to recommend it to anyone. If youre a fan of the movie this will ruin it for you and if you like brawlers theres a thousand better ones (some from more than 20 years ago outstrip this easily) to satiate your desires. Avoid.
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,GamePro,40,Also disappointing was the lack of any head-to-head or multi-player functionality; theres no unlockable content either. The games themselves are monotonous and dont really instill you with a need to play them repeatedly.

Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,PSM Magazine,40,Even if youre a fan of anime we recommend you keep your distance from Mamodo Fury. [Nov. 2006 p.81]
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Destructoid,40,Still its not the worst thing on shelves right now but its $49.99 price tag isnt doing the game any favors either. Maybe as a deep discount title or even a digital download with some of the games more frustrating modes stripped out (let me run over zombies for ten bucks!) Blood Drive might have been a more attractive proposition.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Gamer.nl,40,Prison Break is a disappointment on all fronts. The fighting system has been badly implanted and the presentation is lacklustre. The only redeeming features are the sneaking around and the development of the plot but it’s not enough to keep this game from falling flat on it’s face. Someone throw the keys away.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,G4 TV,40,Squarely intent on holding the middle ground in every sense of the phrase this isnt a terrible game but it isnt especially good either.

Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Machinima,40,A game that not even die hard Family Guy fans will appreciate. The jokes and crude humor are taken too far even for the shows standards. Couple that with drab gameplay and poor controls and youve got a game that should be avoided by most accounts.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PSX Extreme,41,The Golden Compass really isnt anything more than yet another game based on a movie that falls well shy of quality. ‘sigh The trend may never die.
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,All that said Scourge is cheap and if youre looking for a no-frills co-op shooter to keep you and three friends mildly entertained you could do worse.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,GamesRadar+,40,If your biggest complaint about previous such entries is that they didnt include horseback riding hang gliding or skiing then MotionSports might get you in front of the TV for a weekend of flawed fun. Otherwise we suggest leaving this one on the sidelines.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,MEGamers,36,A repetitive nature not yet seen in the current generation of gaming.

Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,33,Deep Black: Reloaded is an underwater Gears of War clone. While a good idea in theory the execution here is all wrong. Frustrating action poor checkpointing boring level designs and enemies that take far too many bullets to kill. There are some good ideas here but you have to dive deep to find them!
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,NZGamer,40,The gaming equivalent of buying a gourmet mince and cheese pie - youll be uncertain youve got your moneys worth and pretty sure you could have done a better job.
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,ZTGD,40,The entire time I played Montague’s Mount I felt lost helpless blind crippled and confused. Unfortunately that doesn’t make for a very good or interesting game.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Deeko,40,Its pure repetitiveness is enough to make any chocolate lover long for a nice salty snack treat. So make your dentist happy and stay far far away from this title. It will leave a very bitter aftertaste and have you reaching for your mouthwash.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Adrenaline Vault,40,A key problem may simply be that the international system is too hard to replicate under its current condition of relative anarchy.
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Developer Kylotonn has crafted the least appealing fantasy brawler imaginable its stillborn mechanics drenched in over-compensatory cutscene-driven storytelling its charms limited to the lure of unlockable combos and abilities.
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,38,The result is a brutally slow pace and a game that doesnt pack much of anything for anybody. The AI is horrendous the control is abysmal and the announcing... [Jan 2004 p.73]
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,DarkStation,40,Huge sporting events dont translate well into video games as the developer goes for quantity instead of quality making it a sad button mashing affair.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,42,Its what a bag of roast beef crisps is to a Sunday roast with all the trimmings. [Sept 2007 p.90]
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,Meristation,40,With poor graphics bad gameplay (despite some interesting points in the battle system) and bland story Drive Girls fails to match the quality of the popular franchise Senran Kagura despite some more than evident similarities in concept. The driving parts dont look like part of a professional game.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,PC Gamer,40,While not a total disaster [it] barely even offers cosmetic upgrades to the 2000 versions incredibly dull gameplay format. [Oct 2003 p.112]
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,GamerWeb Sony,35,Some of the worst gameplay Ive ever had the misfortune of laying eyes on and the entire look and feel of the game is seriously lacking.

25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,The A.V. Club,33,You have to struggle with touchy controls and flaws in the game logic. For example if you hang onto a human shield for too long the cops will just shoot your hostage to get him out of the way. How is that fair to anybody?
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,VGPub,45,Pocket Racer[s] screams budget title in every way. The gameplay is generic even by mid-’90s standards the graphics are bland and the sound will leave you wanting a lot more.
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,35,The Eternity Clock is a simple platformer rife with tacky bugs abrasive puzzles and timey-wimey guff.
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Game Chronicles,40,Wacky Races: Crash & Dash is not very well put together and suffers from lackluster gameplay.
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,CGMagazine,40,I wish I could be more kind to this game considering it’s an indie title with big ambition but considering Horizon: Zero Dawn and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild came out only a few weeks ago and how similar Troll and I is trying to be to those games there’s really no excusing it.
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,Nintenderos,35,Its a pretty denigrating game. In addition HD vibration and motion controls have to learn a lot of eroticism yet. If they wanted perversion they could have gone to the extreme and not stay in the bikinis with small moans and senpais.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,ZTGD,40,The original game is still more complete and more fun than the 3DS version and it is 15 years old.

The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,35,This is a kids game. Its also a bad kids game. And theres really no getting around that.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,SpazioGames,40,Macfarlane is a man of many talents. Understanding what makes a videogame great is not one of them unfortunately.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,GameSpot,40,This factory comes off more like a real industrial complex than the fantastic playground of a fop who makes candy with magical midgets.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,TotalPlayStation,35,Nothing about 35 To Life makes it stand out -- save for perhaps the fact that we had to sit through a delay to get this product. Its not terribly fun the storyline is pointless and the gansta tone is utterly unnecessary.
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Nintendo Life,40,A confused messy stealth-puzzler with flaky physics and dodgy controls. Hello Neighbors attempt to do something fresh with a classic cinematic concept is to be applauded but the execution falls flat. A massive missed opportunity.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,Totally360,40,In all honesty though its too pricey and the standard text input method will drive you absolutely crazy within ten seconds of trying to enter a word.
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Digital Chumps,40,Regardless JU-ON: The Grudge: Haunted House Simulator provides very little entertainment beyond the surface appeal and jump scares.
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Game Over Online,40,Thor for the 360 and PS3 is a sub-par God of War clone that does a surface-level job of replicating what makes that kind of game work while missing the point of what works on any kind of deeper level. If you like that style of game play either that series or any other games like it that have been mentioned. The lack of polish here makes it impossible to recommend as a purchase at any price although if you must rent it go with the 360 version since it lacks a mandatory 3GB install. If the movies fresh in your mind and you want a fun Thor game to play try out the 8-bit throwback on Marvels site or use him in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,DarkStation,40,Unlike the dedicated officers of the R.I.P.D. do yourself a favor and just let this one go. I don’t think this needs anymore words to get that point across.

Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,Four Fat Chicks,40,It is to the best of my knowledge the biggest point-and-click real-world-image game ever created. Sadly in all other respects it gives even the least of its peers nothing to aspire to. It doesnt take long to realize that the full screen images of Anacapri (the place) are the only good thing about the game.

Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,Nintendojo,40,Too few mini-games too little fun and frustrating navigation ruin what is essentially an interesting concept.

Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,GameSpy,40,Turn It Around is a one-trick pony thats still looking to perfect its one trick.

Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,eToychest,30,Given that the DS hardware is woefully underutilized Burnout Legends is simply a shoddy game. The essential ingredients are here but there are flash games that have had more quality work put into them.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,AceGamez,35,And well that’s about it. You jump between islands (well still shots of islands) you give and receive arbitrary gifts from Zack and the other girls which supposedly determine who will and won’t be your friend (these girls really are quite shallow y’know) and you play a bunch of dire mini-games. If that sounds fun – Paradise is the place for you or Zack Island or whatever it’s called.
Battleship,Xbox 360,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Tactical,GameOver.gr,40,3.5 hours of FPS/ Strategy hybrid gameplay that is truly awful. Keep away.
Battle: Los Angeles,PC,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Games (Russia),30,A pointless waste of money. [May 2011 p.109]
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,Gamers' Temple,35,Theres no reason to recommend this game to anyone. Its short but feels longer than it is because its so frustrating and poorly designed. The graphics are poor the 3D effects rudimentary and the controls are terrible. Other than that its fine.
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,Meristation,35,Quotation forthcoming.
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Eurogamer Italy,40,Umbrella Corps is a poorly made spin-off and probably the worst game in the Resident Evil franchise. A bunch of interesting idea cant overcome all the technical flaws and the forgettable gameplay created by Capcom.
G.I. Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,PC Gameworld,35,With only a few good features GI Combats disconnected and confusing nature will probably make you glad the war is over.
Driven,PlayStation 2,Nov-6-2001,Bam Entertainment,Driving | Racing | Formula One,PSX Nation,30,Rent Driven along with Squares Driving Emotion Type-S as its suggested in page 47 of Dr. Jack Kevorkians favorite book Final Exit.
Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Game Chronicles,39,I honestly have to say that I had fun with this game just because the gameplay is so outrageously bad.
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Gaming Nexus,38,Godzilla Unleashed has all the makings of a good monster fighting game and none of the content
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,GameOver.gr,40,A bland uninspired game with old-school gameplay and boring design. Think twice before you cross paths with Eric Bane.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpot,40,Its not zombies you need worry about in the painfully dull The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Machinima,45,Out of the Shadows has all the trimmings of a fantastic brawler but none of it works as it should. For every highlight the game showcases there are multiple failures: shoddy controls a complicated combat system and far too many glitches.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,GameZone,35,The coup de grace was slowdown that plagued the game from beginning to end even when running through the many vacant hallways.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamingExcellence,38,It is a shame that VR is nothing more than a poor man’s Splinter Cell with a dash of Resident Evil thrown in for flavour.
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,MS Xbox World,35,Destined to prematurely hit the bargain bucket of game stores worldwide Thor fails miserably in its bid to reignite the action and excitement that this summers blockbuster superhero smash brought to the big screens in waves. Predictably as a videogame movie adaptation Thor fails epically. Interestingly enough though as a cure for long-term insomnia it cant be highly enough recommended.
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,We Got This Covered,40,Unfairly difficult and technically incompetent Project Root is a classic example of a good idea gone horribly horribly wrong.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,GameSpot,35,Poor controls and a ton of pointless gimmicks make for one frustrating round of Astroturf golf.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,3DJuegos,32,Raven Squad is bland boring and definitely not fun. Avoid it at all cost.
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,GamingExcellence,38,Seven Kingdoms: Conquest fails to do anything right. Balance problems technical issues pace story graphics…I can go on. It’s not worth playing.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine,35,Youd think it would be hard to mess up a samurai game but developer Genki has managed to deliver a royal swordplay stinker with Kengo: Legend of the 9. [Dec 2007 p.76]
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,All Game Guide,40,Control is brutal in this game forcing players to grit their teeth and redo each maneuver multiple times before it registers correctly.
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,4Players.de,39,First of all Blades of Time wasn’t a particularly good game when it was originally released seven years ago. And with this version showing even more performance issues than back then I cannot find any reasonable answer why this game was granted a re-release.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GameSpot,35,If Rock Revolution came out two or three years ago it might have been revolutionary but in 2008 its not even relevant. Uninspired presentation a tiny tracklist that includes no master tracks a complete lack of vocal support uninteresting gameplay and a barebones Career mode are just a few of the many ways in with Rock Revolution fails.
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameSpot,32,Whether youre a fan of the cartoon or a fan of fighting games Legend of the Dragon is a total disappointment.
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Gaming Age,33,Heavy Fire: Red Shadow is just not good. It tries to be a decent game but just fails on every level. The inclusion of VR just adds hope that it will at least be fun for a little while but it turns out just being more of a headache. I figured VR was included to generate some interest in what is essentially a bargain bin title. It’s very basic but there is just no fun to be found here. I cannot recommend even trying this one out even to experience the VR mode as it just doesn’t deliver any kind of lasting appeal.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GMR Magazine,40,A crappy lock-on system snaps the Terminators weapon right to a target oftentimes one thats right underneath a grate and thus untouchable all the while ignoring a more obvious threat.
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Games Master UK,38,The shame here isnt that this is a a bad beat-em-up. Its that its a good one saddled with so much nonsense and tedium that youre unlikely to care. [Aug 2014 p.78]
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Twinfinite,40,Despite this generous clutch of problems there is an odd charm to the game. Its schlock is part of its allure and each time I loaded the game I felt as though I was returning to a well-thumbed piece of pulp horror trash or sliding an old VHS B-movie slasher into the machine – its cheap ghouls awash with scan lines. I found myself smirking way more than I was frustrated but I can’t in good conscience say it’s worth picking up outside of the bargain bin you’d find the films it takes its cues from.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamestyle,40,Potter fans will be disappointed by this lazy attempt that is substandard fare and lacks options. EA Bright Light will have to revolutionise its approach if the franchise is to end on a high.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Games.cz,40,Unfortunately only an amount of frustration and badly made game is hidden in the tempting package. For a good horror adventure you must go elsewhere.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,Frustrating disheartening and broken in places: a perfect recipe for making kids cry. [Christmas 2007 p.95]
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GamerWeb Sega,40,In keeping with the fine ECW tradition this game is a vile piece of garbage thats a rip-off at half the price.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Digital Entertainment News,38,Left Behind: Eternal Forces misses on all cylinders. The game needs a serious tune-up on nearly every level.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameZone,35,Plagued by a series of problems that go way beyond the awful controls the action just isn’t fun or rewarding enough to keep gamers wanting to see this through to the end.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Cheat Code Central,40,Not only is Evolution Snowboarding a lame snowboarding game but its a lame fighter as well so you know what that makes the whole game dont you?
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GamePro,30,One of the most maddening problems is that each time you die (which happens a lot) you respawn at the beginning of the level. There is no continue option and you can’t skip the-story-so-far screens.
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamerWeb Nintendo,35,This game is for little Timmy not for you.
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Impulsegamer,40,As combat plays an integral part to Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor and if the Kinect controls worked flawlessly this game would have been a blast as you fought your enemies. To make matters worse checkpoints between deaths are far too long which makes it an effort to continue.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,3DJuegos,40,Its poor graphics repetitive missions and awful controls make this Godzilla a bad videogame.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,IGN,35,A very poor remake of a classic arcade game. The Level 30 bug definitely hurts the product but in all honestly it just makes a bad game worse.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,IGN,40,Pure Futbol is a mess of a soccer game. Its cover claims that an authentic experience awaits but whats actually in store for players who pick up this game is far from the real deal.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Everyeye.it,40,One of the worst Tie-Ins in videogame history. Theres simply no reason in the world to buy this game. Poor graphics and frustrating gameplay mean only failure.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Games Master UK,36,The graphics would shame a third-party N64 game - theyre that bad. [Mar 2007 p.74]
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Eurogamer Italy,40,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle fails in so many basic aspects of the fighting genre that it will be hard to enjoy the game even if you a are die hard Touhou fans. Gameplay is repetitive and boring the game falls short on contents and graphics feels so dated that this could be easily mistaken for a N64 or at least for an early PS2 game.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,ZTGD,35,Overall I was left feeling empty whilst playing Randall. A game that tried very hard to shine with its varying gameplay styles but ends up failing on all fronts; and totally messes up the platforming elements making it frustrating to play.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,IGN,35,Don’t be fooled by the fact that it’s a familiar brand that Nintendo published it or that it’s a limited release: this game is a bad one.
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,Modojo,40,In the end Napoleon Dynamite: The Game does little to fight the stereotype of low quality licensed games.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,Times Online,40,The result in single-player mode is a messy unresponsive mass of button-pushing and frantic joystick-twiddling that evolves from impossible to challenging to repetitive and dull in less than an hour.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,GameSpot,34,Not only does Pocket Pool miserably fail to deliver an enjoyable game of billiards but its attempts at titillation are more depressing than anything else.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,Nintendo Gamer,38,Its well intentioned but underfunded. [Christmas 2009 p.64]
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GamesRadar+,30,Avoid this one like the glowing radioactive ooze that it is.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,PTGamers,40,And to finish it off this game is just awful. That’s a shame really since I had hoped it would turn out acceptable.
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpy,37,The fighting system found within Shifters is guaranteed to make just about anyone cringe. Calling it simple is a horrid understatement.
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Nintendo Gamer,33,This strives for nothing and doesnt even make it that far. A poor game for a poor franchise. [JPN Import; Aug 2007 p.54]
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,35,Quantum Theory can hardly be congratulated for infringing on other games as it is hardly even capable of doing that properly. Albeit all attempts to be Gears of War Quantum Theory is no more fun than burning $60 dollars and to be honest burning money isnt exactly a lucrative or entertaining hobby.
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Games Radar,50,If youre likely to be amused by the puerile humour youll find this mildly diverting and entertaining otherwise avoid - this is a genre thats overpopulated and there are far better examples than this.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,DailyGame,40,Its just a waste of a strong license. I really hope Chuck Palahniuk the author of the book this mess is based upon had nothing to do with oking this game. Avoid at all costs even if its in the discount bin.
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Multiplayer.it,40,Agony represents everything that a horror videogame should never become.
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Worth Playing,33,Crash Boom Bang is a mess. There are too many unneeded features not enough time was spent developing the important ones and hundreds of small hiccups and issues make this game feel like it should have gone through more inspections at every level of design.
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpy,35,A hack-and-slash fest in its most basic embarrassing form -- and faulty at that.
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,1UP,35,From looking at it youd probably never guess it was an Unreal Engine game. It lacks any real distinguishing features struggles to run smoothly in places and aside from a few nice special effects never remotely approaches the expected visual impact.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,MondoXbox,35,A very poorly produced game with too many problems to be even considered as a possibile buy.
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,Hot Games,40,Theres so much more wrong with the game (especially the lack of multi-player and password save system – would a battery have cost that much?) that even the great sound and mediocre game play are swallowed up by this product.
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,DualShockers,35,I’d stay as far away from Left Alive as possible. For all of you hardcore Front Mission fans hoping for a proper sequel in the series you can bury those hopes and dreams. With a team consisting of so much talent behind it I truly wonder what went wrong with Left Alive. I love Square Enix games to death typically but this is frankly unacceptable…and it’s $60.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Cheat Code Central,40,Dont confuse this game with the console games however. Console games good; GBA game bad.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Giant Bomb,40,A game with no originality and not much excitement either.
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,Eurogamer Italy,40,Unfortunately the game is an unrefined mess full of bugs framerate drops and bad physics. It’s more a puzzle-platformer with stealth and some basic rpg elements instead of an rpg dungeon crawler and it’s not so immersive and free as the developers think. Maybe it will be improved in fact the graphic it’s good and so the locations design but right now it’s not the spiritual successor that backers deserved.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Nintendo Gamer,37,The presentations pretty ropey too. [Dec 2008 p.76]
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,IGN,35,Ready 2 Rumble Revolution isnt one of the worst looking games on the Wii but it certainly is one of the worst playing games on the system.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Gaming Age,33,The game is a mess from the opening bell to the K.O. punch. As for differences between the two versions nothing was touched up for the Xbox version and both games are virtually identical.
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Hobby Consolas,30,Based on classic RPGs such as Eye of the Beholder Crystal Rift feels like a poor adaptation. Dungeons are repetitive graphics are too basic and it causes dizziness when played with PSVR due to camera controls.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,Quandary,30,All up Cypher was disappointing. But I did feel a sense of accomplishment when I had finished albeit with some help.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Definitely not worth the ridiculous 800 MP asking price. [Aug 2008 p.94]
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameBrink,39,It’s a boring ugly game with complicated controls and a B-Flick storyline. Who can’t wait for the US release!? [JPN Import]
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameSpy,40,The party mentioned in the title is a very short one and players will likely decide to leave it early to knock on other doors: Rayman: Raving Rabbids and Wario Ware offer much more fun for only slightly more cash.
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,31,While you can teach an old dog new tricks its still a dog. [Nov 2011 p.95]
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gamers' Temple,35,Lucha Fury could be a decent brawler but the fun in its gameplay is brought down greatly by its bad controls.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,GameSpot,30,Not counting massively multiplayer delivery quests my top benchmark for delivery-style games is still Choplifter. Fluster Cluck can be found at the opposite end of that spectrum.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,All Game Guide,40,Unfortunately these real-world feelings are nothing more than lapses in programming in this action/simulation.
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Worth Playing,35,Past Cure is many things: technically infuriating a slog and thematically inconsistent. While one can appreciate the effort of a small team trying to craft a game that does many things it cant seem to do any of them well enough to warrant any attention. With a glut of better games that tackle similar elements on the platform its very difficult to recommend Past Cure to people even as a quick diversion.
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,Eurogamer Italy,40,Filling the narrative gap between the two main chapters sounds original but the game completely fails. Ignition is a faux pas in Dead Space universe with annoying gameplay and horrible graphics: an experience you can easily and definitely avoid.
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,GameZone,38,If you must play Pimp My Ride try the 360 version. Play this version and you’ll put yourself through a lot of unnecessary frustration.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Thunderbolt,30,A bad game. You might assume that a company as reputable as the History Channel might take more care to protect their license but its clear that they just wanted to make a quick buck.
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Eurogamer,40,While Sniper: Art of Victory is superior to its brother in arms and the sniping mechanic itself is reasonably well implemented there are still too many flaws here to recommend it.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Game Over Online,40,Its something youll play for a little while but youll soon realize that watching the real thing is far more exciting. It sounds better. It feels faster. And youll get to see the podium and hear the anthem of the victors nation.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,Absolute Games,30,Darkstar made me feel like a time traveler. It is as if at the end of the last century fearing the 2K error apocalypse someone put this game in a capsule and only now a team of archaeologists has unearthed these artifact CDs.
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Destructoid,30,A nostalgic joke taken too far. Though there are postivies in the presentation the gameplay is laborious even draining. Shaq Fu outstays its welcome despite its meagre run-time which is far more offensive than its juvenile attempts at edgy comedy. Shaq shouldve known better than to put his name to this and everyone shouldve known better than to put money into its creation.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Nintendophiles,37,Meant as a game to ease beginners into this type of stealth genre. The way it does that ends up being condescending for experienced gamers and for beginners will be annoying due to AI glitches.
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,IGN,35,Kung Fu Rider is not a good game. The controls are terribly unresponsive the game punishes players unfairly and the level design is repetitive.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,4Players.de,40,Yes it is playable. And some dribbling looks decent. But if youre looking for the next generation of basketball this is not it.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Areajugones,35,Coffin Dodgers fails in all possible ways: gameplay game modes tracks… Its nonexistent variety and its simple gameplay are the burdens of a game that had good potential.
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GamingXP,40,I have no idea why such crimes against gamedom even get published. Simple advice: hands off! Well at least the sound is good.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,PSM Magazine,30,The gameplay is similar to the PS3 version--but with a static camera limited hero skills boss fights that drag across multiple levels and mediocre PS2 graphics the end result is an irritating mess of pointless repetition. [Sept 2007 p.84]
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpot,35,This third-person shooter is a trip into hell.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,1UP,35,The Shield is too little too late; what wouldve been a merely mediocre license tie-in is now due to its very late birth simply a bad game.
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpy,30,Its out and it costs money despite being far from ready for prime time. Even as a quirky indie release with a budget price Orion asks for too big a leap of faith that itll eventually work out.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Eurogamer Italy,40,Porting an adventure game onto a console system is always a risk: Dream Chronicles offers a boring gameplay poor enigmas and most of all a frustrating pixel hunting from the beginning to the end. Needless to say youll miss your PC mouse a lot.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,GamingExcellence,40,Wasted potential is all I see here but the lack of quality in Power Gig doesnt make it any easier to see anything more. It simply isnt worth it for the guitar nor the game: buy a cheap Six String if you want to learn the strings leave this title alone.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Game Chronicles,26,Sadly the sound is the best part of Air Conflicts but who really cares about sound when the game looks below average and is virtually unplayable.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,TeamXbox,34,The outdated and unfunny jokes horrible fighting engine and lackluster visuals and sound make this a game that could have been but never will. Stay very far away.
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Play Magazine,40,Why does the house of Metal Gear Z.O.E. Contra Silent Hill and Castlevania need to bestow upon us such mediocre kiddy fare as this? [Jan 2003 p.81]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,Cheat Code Central,40,First generation cell-phone games had more interesting gameplay.
Hollow,Switch,Feb-22-2018,MMEU,Action Adventure | Survival,Nintendo Life,30,Hollow is an incredibly ugly game with the kind of plentiful technical issues that make it actively difficult to play. Those with a masochistic streak might derive some pleasure from its abrasiveness and its downbeat tone but most Switch-owning horror fans would be much better served playing through Resident Evil Revelations and its sequel for the umpteenth time.
Legends of Pegasus,PC,Aug-10-2012,Kalypso | Novacore Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | 4X,GameSpot,40,Legends of Pegasus had a grand plan but developer Novacore didnt come close to pulling off what it set out to do. Like storied Bellerophon its hubris has proved its ultimate undoing.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,Xbox 360,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Cheat Code Central,38,There are songs to play you cant get anywhere else but you should really ask yourself if you to play them on a real-fake guitar.
Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,InsideGamer.nl,35,Damnation sucks at every front. The futuristic cowboy setting is lame the shootouts are boring and the story is just stupid. Damnation will ruin your day your marriage and even your life.
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,40,Alekhine’s Gun is a title where the ambition of design outmatches the execution with gusto.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Electronic Gaming Monthly,30,Just too troubled to even bother renting. [May 2002 p.112]
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,IGN,33,Its a slow-paced shooter with shoddy AI dated graphics and a frustrating design. Even though its good for a few irreverent laughs its not worth paying for even in the bargain bin.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,GameWatcher,30,Umbrella Corps is a big game from a major publisher in a popular franchise in that franchise’s anniversary year and it’s both awful and dead on arrival. Now I see why Capcom didn’t tell anyone that it came out.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,PSX-Sense.nl,35,This should never have come out on PS3 as evidenced by a sh.tload of technical issues. If you absolutely want this at best mediocre experience we advise you go for the PC version.
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,Console Monster,33,The game is lifeless dull and has no real goals. You can dodge your way to victory by dodging this one.
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,FNintendo,30,Arc of Alchemist does one thing right: it looks like a charm. It certainly doesnt play like one though and its performance is anything but enjoyable not to mention a dull and drab plot and characters that will leave any player disenchanted with any hint of joy that its visual environment might suggest.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,AceGamez,40,With such a poor fighting engine youre going to get bored very quickly; tapping on one button isnt going to please most fighting fans.
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Wccftech,35,Eternity: The Last Unicorn is a less-than-magical mix of misplaced PS1-era nostalgia and shallow Dark Souls mimicry. Nearly everything about the game from its fixed camera angles to its clunky combat to its copious backtracking is broken or irritating in some way. If challenge is all you’re looking for in a game perhaps Eternity: The Last Unicorn is for you. Everyone else will likely find it as fun as a sharpened horn to the eye.
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,Push Square,30,Tokyo Tattoo Girls is a simple strategy game which can be fun in small doses but is sadly not interesting enough to keep you playing for long. The story is poor the characters are strange (and not in a good way) and the gameplay is lacking. The artwork and tattoos look gorgeous so it’s a pity they weren’t in a better game.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Jeuxvideo.com,35,One Piece: Grand Cruise is certainly a pretty game but there’s nothing much to do in its big world. Nothing fun in any case. It’s a boring short and annoying game that hurts the One Piece franchise.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameSpot,35,If you live a life of sin and gluttony Infernal will be waiting for you in the afterlife.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer's Pulse,34,Underachieves in all aspects of game design. The level design and gameplay are boring unimaginative and repetitive.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,Zentendo,40,Sub-par gameplay with almost unbearable controls. Boring uninspired content from missions to visuals to the audio work. Not even hardcore fans of the show should spend more money than a rental on this sucker.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,IGN,36,Theres a lot of utterly stupid crap in Bad Boys: Miami Takedown and yet its kind of enjoyable in an I love watching car wrecks kind of way.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,TotalGames.net,40,Its just plain bad. Whats worse is that either the developer or the publisher is fully aware of how atrocious Rise Of The Machines is. This is of course complete speculation but...
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,AceGamez,40,Kids arent going to want to rescue the bad guys of the movie kids want to explore the factory swim in the chocolate lakes and hijack cars.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,GameSpot,35,The Nintendo DS rendition of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a short collection of generic levels that hardly relate to the movie at all.
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,Official Xbox Magazine,35,As a pre-order freebie Ignition isnt bad but it isnt worth paying for or playing through otherwise. [Jan 2011 p.69]
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,IGN Spain,36,7 Days to Die tries hard to provide the same experience we had on PC but it fails in its attempt due to the controller adaptation and the visible graphical downgrade.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameShark,30,Heck even the character select screen looks boring. When you get to the game the drab color selection and lack of anything truly new will bore you to tears.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Zentendo,30,George of the Jungle may be aimed at young children and their requirements may be different from that of a videogame reviewer but this is just nothing more than sloppy.
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,35,Even if you were completely charmed by Philip Pullmans work or enjoyed the movie adaptation theres absolutely no reason to give this game a try. Even the music as pretty as it is cant redeem such poor gameplay and atrocious presentation.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,A completely unremarkable WWII shooter with more bugs than Pixars second feature film. Theres nothing offensive about it its just subpar in every possible way from AI to controls to visuals to voice acting. Feels like a launch window 360 game.
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,Cheat Code Central,44,Terrible. There is a split-screen multiplayer option but I cant imagine anyone whod want to participate and why would they? Sluggish controls poor attention to detail lack of customization and unbalanced difficulty all makes Showtime Championship Boxing a dud.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,GameSpot,34,Unless you want to spend $20 to be bored to tears you should stay away from Street Jam Basketball.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Gamenikki,30,To put it simply its nearly impossible to enjoy Bad Boys: Miami Takedown without being completely naive. The presentation game play and voice acting are all about 10 years behind its a sad state of affairs.
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,Games Master UK,34,A point-n-click with minimal pointing and telegraphed clicking. NCIS fan? Still avoid this. [Feb 2012 p.98]
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Multiplayer.it,30,Its better to avoid Merchants of Brooklyn. Its price is something out of mind when youll start to see its gameplay contents and the low level of technology of this game.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Chronicles,40,Just too little and far too late. The WWII genre isn’t exactly short on titles these days nor is the FPS genre. If you plan on releasing a game in either (and especially both) you had better bring your A game.
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,DarkZero,30,Thanks to Street Fighter IV’s rebirth of the genre there is now a wealth of options to pick from when it comes to fighting games so there are no reasons to buy the generic sounding Girl Fight because this is a bad budget fighter with no redeeming qualities to enjoy.
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,GamesRadar+,30,Ultimately Valhalla Knight: Eldar Saga suffers from an overall lack of polish as well as being an all-around boring game. Only those starved for an action RPG should think of treading the lands of Eldar. Everyone else need not apply.
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,Hardcore Gamer,30,Outside of the cheese factor everything here is just dull. Loads of banal conversations wooden acting and obvious advice abound for every one moment you can laugh over Richard deciding to grab a girl’s rear end in what can only be described as a video game in the loosest sense of the term. This might be a weird thing to hear from a critic but just wait for the highlights to go up on YouTube instead. You’ll get the same chuckle-worthy stupidity and save some money in the process. It’s a game about being a pick-up artist that you should in no way consider picking up.
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Game Over Online,32,Fugitive Hunter seems to utilize random nonsensical damage instead of the target specific kind and the game’s defamation of the law of physics and its shoddy collision detection makes it seem like you’re constantly trekking through Jello. All that and no multiplayer. Bummer.
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Eurogamer,30,The results feel neutered and unfinished.
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,32,Ugly unplayable and not even close to being fun. [Nov 2007 p.92]
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Brash Games,30,This is not the worst game but when there’s so much better out there there really is no reason to play it.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Play UK,32,Shellshock 2 combines technical inferiority as a shooter with a woeful attempt at survival horror. It’s kicked around and stomped to death by Call Of Duty and Silent Hill in their respective genres and is thus left as an entirely useless exercise in gaming terms.
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Vandal,40,The ideas are good but not their implementation. There are some serious issues when it comes to the difficulty and level design that sadly ruin the general experience.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,GameStar,32,Quotation forthcoming.
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,Computer Games Magazine,30,You are apt to play the same segments over and over ad nauseam. Perhaps a more appropriate title might have been Groundhog Day II.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Machinima,30,The controls are clunky the graphics are student project-basic the plot isnt worth discussing and the levels so repetitive youll have seen all it has to offer within half an hour.
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GamerWeb Nintendo,35,Its presentation is laughable to the point where it probably would have been unimpressive even on the Game Boy Color.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameSpot,25,Stupid AI and sluggish performance are just two of the many problems that plague Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops.
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,Multiplayer.it,30,Financial issues killed an old-school promising shooter in its own cradle.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,My Gamer,32,Unless something drastic happens to the series perhaps THQ is better putting this old dog down.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PSX-Sense.nl,30,What could have been a great game has turned out to be the exact opposite: a rushed effort supported with ugly graphics and boring gameplay. Granted Michael Rooker and Norman Reedus voice acting is pitch perfect but thats hardly worth spending fifty dollars for... isnt it?
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,MondoXbox,40,Past Cure shows a lot of love for specific video games and movies with a huge ambition to emulate them but the developers fell incredibly short of their target producing a very troubled game in pretty much every aspect except for the soundtrack.
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,Console Gameworld,38,Its an extremely challenging set of minigames based on the most unlikely movie tie-in ever; give it a pass unless youre as calm patient and wise as Morgan Freeman.
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,TheXboxHub,30,In many ways Agony delivers an authentic experience of the archaic interpretation of ‘Hell’. Playing this game feels like torture an exercise in utter tedium as you perform the same tasks and witness the same ‘gruesome’ scenes. Unfortunately I don’t think it’s that meta it simply tries too hard. Squandering any potential it might’ve had the result is a shallow monotonous experience that’s not worth your time.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Multiplayer.it,35,After the fairly good on-rail shooter released last year the Transformers come back on Wii and this time around they cant actually transform. However thats not the major problem. Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition is in fact a poorly executed action game with cumbersome controls repetitive action and a very short single player campaign.
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,Worth Playing,40,The stylish storytelling and the possibilities posed by the setting cant hide the embarrassing localization the unexciting fetch-the-key gameplay that most every other FPS has moved beyond and issues with the graphics that might have you reaching for the nearest bottle of pain relievers and asking what happened to quality testing.
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,SpazioGames,40,Poor playability a complete lack of I.A. and bad graphics spoil the chance for another good Astro Boy title. The fan should forget this one and stick to the old Segas Omega Factor.
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,Gamezilla!,30,This game has less to see than most budget titles I’ve seen and it still carries a top shelf price tag.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Switch Player,40,Fantasy Hero Unsigned Legacy should be an additive title with plenty to keep you coming back for countless hours. Sadly problems throughout the title make this a hard one to love. You may find some enjoyment but it likely wont be worth the trouble.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Digital Entertainment News,30,The Shield in the end is a game that will only appeal to the true hardcore fans. If you love the TV series rent it otherwise take a pass.
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,35,For a game that plays up its characters’ sex appeal Girl Fight is stupefyingly unattractive. The character models look like last-gen remnants and their complete lack of personality and combat pizazz makes them utterly forgettable.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,GameSpy,30,While all of this good on paper the game fails miserably when it comes to execution. Simply put Evil Prophecy just isnt any fun.
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,Cheat Code Central,30,Fails on so many levels. It looks bad the control system suffers from lag and ineffective weapon designs the AI is incredibly unbalanced and the missions are a repetitive mix of elements.
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,Game Informer,33,Tears of joy rolled down my cheeks at the exact moment that I ejected this game from my Xbox. I then proceeded to toss it on the floor and violently smash it with a sledgehamer into a thousand little pieces. [Jan 2003 p.114]
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Digital Chumps,30,Its hard to watch a game stumble with every step but AMY repeatedly demolishes any reason to suspect Occams razor shouldnt be employed; its a dreadful game and a miserable experience.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Destructoid,30,The game never really takes off relying on very few tricks to support itself from beginning to end.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,GameSpot,23,Superman Returns for the DS is a terrible game for numerous reasons.
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,Total PC Gaming,30,A haven for low-resolution textures a lack of modern graphical technology frequent clipping issues and camera angles that pan into walls and obstruct your view. [Issue#10 p.56]
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,PSM Magazine,30,A collection of terribly constructed animations horribly limited replay and a create-a-boxer mode thats shallower than it first seems. [Sept 2002 p.31]
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,4Players.de,34,I wouldn’t have missed a thing if this game would have stayed away from consoles. This is just a boring technically absolutely unimpressive simulation that fails at the only thing it should rather do well: Simulate.
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,Multiplayer.it,30,You can (barely) fathom some good ideas about offering the players more accessibility in a saga that surely needed some but they soon get lost in the utter and complete mess of unfinished mechanics and bugs that sadly is X Rebirth.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,Metro GameCentral,30,The developer’s love for Resident Evil and old school survival horror is obvious but this poorly made homage does nobody any favours.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,Cinescape,25,Unfortunately the graphics are simply horrible. The entire game lacks any real pizzazz and the entire game feels lifeless.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,NintendoWorldReport,30,An insult to gamers and anime fans alike. With its charismatic cast and open-ended special-agent plot device Yu Yu Hakusho is a prime franchise for videogames but judging from this rush job the developer and publisher don’t seem to recognize this.
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Computer Games Magazine,30,There is a nice mix of unit types including heroes and the game even gives you spells to cast but the AI is so poor and the presentation so lazy youd be much better off buying the boardgame from an import store.
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,Gamezilla!,35,For the love of all that is holy stay away from this game it’s one of the worst examples of use of license out there.
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Gameblog.fr,30,Call of Duty Black Ops: Declassified has only its name going for it. Everything else is piss poor from both design and production standpoints.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,IGN,30,If youre looking for a slow moving game with sub-par graphics poor gameplay and horrible controls then Mistmare is the game for you.
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameShark,30,Oh my god. I thought the Game.com version of Mortal Kombat was bad. That cant hold a torch to this log.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,IGN,32,Crossfire simply fails to do the one thing it has to do and thats to entertain. It takes archaic forms of gameplay and tries to update them for the next-generation but fails in almost every respect.
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,DarkZero,30,If only some time and effort went into creating what could be an enjoyable romp. As it turns out this reeks of disappointment.
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,IGN,35,Yes it’s one of the worst games on Wii as far as tech goes and yeah there are countless other light gun experiences out there that’ll destroy this one in terms of pure gameplay but damn if this isn’t fun in its own seriously crippled way.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PC Format,32,A PS2 port when theres an Xbox 360 version? This is a dreadful example of shameless corner cutting and an awful game. [Aug 2008 p.107]
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamePen,30,And as if uninspired gameplay wasn’t enough the game is chock full of the dandiest bugs this side of my bathtub. Let’s see - where to begin. Clipping bad frame rates stuck fighters horrid camera movement moves that just don’t work and sluggish controls.
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Hooked Gamers,35,Rekoil is an uninspired first-person shooter that fails to deliver on any of its promise.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,COGconnected,35,Even if you can get past the poor humour and lack of story the controls and combat just feel bad.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,PSX Extreme,28,Women’s Volleyball Championship doesn’t do anything right. It does however fail miserably in a variety of different areas and remains mediocre in the aspects where it’s not a total failure.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,TotalPlayStation,33,But if you’re looking for a poorly-assembled gimmick of a game that serves as a friendly reminder of the good ol’ Celebrity Deathmatch days on MTV all for a discounted price of $19.99 then CD just might be for you. If you’re not looking for authenticity though stay far far away from this one.
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,ZTGD,30,Yes the game was finally starting to grab me ever so slightly and then it just sort of ends. It makes me wonder if the game was even finished or they just decided to wrap up and release.
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,TeamXbox,31,Only the undead could enjoy a game filled with numerous glitches and a sincere lack of creativity across the board. Avoid this title like a flesh-eating zombie unless of course you just have to have all things Romero in your collection.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,Game Informer,20,While playing through Escape Dead Island I was continually offended that anyone would be asked to pay for this experience. Any number of developmental issues could have caused this train wreck from budgetary problems or creative crises and well likely never know the whole truth. But as it stands Escape Dead Island is worth nobodys time.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,XGN,30,Sonic Boom Rise of Lyric is a real disappointment for Sonic fans. There is basically nothing positive to say about this game. Sonic deserves much better.
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Xbox Tavern,35,Gene Rain is a complete waste of storage space. The game’s nonsensical and incoherent story confusingly bounces around like flubber in a basketball court. It doesn’t help that the voice acting is the worst I’ve heard since the original Resident Evil. Grouping that with the game’s sluggish controls its bland locations and its lack of originality collectively makes for one of the worst cover-shooters this gen.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,A promising concept is steamrollered in a game that doesnt really work as a platformer and breaks down entirely as a racer. Wed rather be kicked in the shins for eight hours than play this again.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,DailyGame,30,The game is easy shallow and repetitive. Stop reading this and buy Brain Age. Your brain will thank you.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Polygon,30,The tide has begun to turn for licensed games thanks to great efforts like those from Telltale Rocksteadys Batman franchise and others. The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is the exact sort of lazy cheap cash-grab that gave licensed games a bad name in the first place. To put a slightly less nostalgic twist on an old cliche: They dont make em like this anymore.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,21,A game that simply attempts to cash in on the success of Counter-Strike and the Rainbow Six series by copying their themes but it ends up falling well short of the mark because of its terrible graphics engine its ill-conceived design and a campaign that takes only a few hours to (nearly) complete.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Meristation,30,A shooting game that fails to understand how a Shootem Up works. If you fail with the most basic core of your game mechanic it says enough about your game.
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,AceGamez,30,The developers of Jenga World Tour have done pretty much all they can to make the game reach its full potential - its just that it never had much to work with. Single cartridge multiplayer would have helped a great deal but even that wouldnt have lifted it into the average category.
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,The core fighting system is designed well enough but the Kinect control is lazily implemented and theres absolutely no variety to the fights. [Issue#66 p.93]
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,The biggest challenge is dealing with the wonky physics. [May 2007 p.114]
Coliseum,PC,Jan-6-2004,Stormcloud Creations,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing,GameSpot,38,Surprisingly dull and is lacking in both personality and depth...Sloppy shallow and ultimately forgettable the game never lives up to its undeniably catchy concept.
Kabuki Warriors,Xbox,Nov-19-2001,Light Weight,Action | Fighting | 2D,XenGamers,25,There are much better things to spend one’s money on. Like root canals.
Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,IGN,24,The game is about on par with a chop-shop web game and does very little to use the Wii controls at all.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Joystiq,30,Unlike Deadly Premonition Earth Defense Force 2025 or other games that hide genuine depth behind an awkward presentation Magus has no hidden quality charm or saving grace. Its entirely witless and none of its mechanics strive for anything beyond mediocrity. Despite its issues though Magus is surprisingly breezy to play.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,4Players.de,28,Games like this are the reason why movie tie-ins have a bad reputation. Technically sound but otherwise redundant boring and worse than the 2011 game Sanctum of Slime while totally overpriced even the multiplayer aspect cannot save anything.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GamePro,30,A game that’s awful in every respect and will ultimately be a textbook example of a wasted license.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Cheat Code Central,30,Avoid this one like the Black Plague.
Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GamesRadar+,30,We can definitely see aspirations of greatness here so its too bad Toy Shop is so unpolished overall.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,ZTGD,30,With its dodgy controls and dull combat it is hard to recommend this game to anybody even a real retro brawler fan.
Genesis Alpha One,PlayStation 4,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PLAY! Zine,55,Monotone missions and uninventive enemies combined with bad AI makes this game more of a chore than enjoyment.
Dr. Luigi,Wii U,Dec-31-2013,Arika | Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,Gameblog.fr,60,Dr. Luigis methods are closely based on Dr. Marios proven experiences but he dares to develop his own therapy through signature pills. This innovative approach speeds up the virus eradication even though it has secondary effects as the versus battles show. Its just a shame that only two players can benefit this treatment since the fun provided is really contagious.
Armored Core 4,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2007,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Jolt Online Gaming UK,65,Series veterans will love the endless customisation four-on-four multiplayer battles and blindingly fast combat but even the most loyal fan will wonder why Armored Core 4 couldn’t have been so much more than it is.
Kill la Kill: IF,Switch,Jul-26-2019,Studio TRIGGER | Aplus,Action Adventure | General | Action | Fighting | 3D,ZTGD,60,Kill la Kill The Game: IF is a unique title for sure. It lacks depth and breadth but makes up for it in wackiness and style. Fans of the anime will likely enjoy it but fighting game fans in general will most likely pass this one by. There just isn’t enough here to make it stand out among the crowd. One thing I can say about it though is that nothing is ever likely to be as bonkers as far as fighting games go…oh who am I kidding?
NASCAR 09,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2008,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Stock Car | Stock Car | Automobile,VideoGamer,60,Its hard to recommend the PS3 version though. With its slow frame rate and other graphical glitches its nowhere near as polished as the Xbox 360 game making this yet another port that hasnt been given enough care and attention.
Mazes of Fate,Game Boy Advance,Dec-6-2006,Sabarasa Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,NintendoWorldReport,65,Despite some good aspects I cant recommend Mazes of Fate unless youre willing to tolerate a half-decent game for 20 hours.
198X,Switch,Jan-23-2020,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,Gaming Age,58,As I said if you have an emotional connection to the era 198X may be exactly what you need in your life. But if you don’t pine for the ‘80s and arcades as a stand-in for your lost youth then 198X probably isn’t something you need to play.
SingStar Celebration,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,Multiplayer.it,70,Thanks to the new smartphone app integration everyone can jump into SingStar Celebration and start singing during your karaoke party.
Pro Cycling Manager Season 2013: Le Tour de France - 100th Edition,PC,Jun-20-2013,Cyanide,Alternative | Biking | Sports | Individual | Biking,IGN Italia,55,The console version of Le Tour De France 2013 tries to simplify gameplay too much by cutting away almost any managerial aspect and has some annoying technical issues especially in terms of frame rate. Its a mediocre game plain and simple.
Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor - Martyr,PlayStation 4,Aug-23-2018,Maximum Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Vandal,56,Martyr has many good ideas but the execution isn’t that good. It becomes repetitive very quickly and its poor technical side doesn’t help either.
The Baconing,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,IGN,60,If all you want to do is play more DeathSpank then this will certainly do the trick. For me once was apparently enough.
Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo,Wii,Oct-20-2009,Media Vision,Action | Adventure | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Age,50,While I think the idea behind a 3D brawler in the Dragon Ball universe is a decent idea I cant see the point in a game that only allows you to fight as Goku and keeps up the overall length that this game does. It does try to offer some replay value but not having additional characters to check out outside of the Tournament mode is a waste and not what I was hoping for with this game.
Heavy Weapon: Atomic Tank,PlayStation 3,Jun-11-2009,PopCap,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Gamers' Temple,58,Heavy Weapon is fun in short bursts but just doesnt give you enough bang for your buck.
Skelattack,PlayStation 4,Jun-2-2020,Ukuza,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpew,60,Skelattack offers an evening of fun with ample lashings of frustration along the way.
Fragments of Him,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Sassybot,Adventure | Visual Novel,COGconnected,55,Fragments of Him is a well thought out story that ultimately is undone by its gameplay choices. By trying to make gamers interact with the story more the story became even more inaccessible. While I can appreciate the sentiment that Sassybot was gunning for the delivery ended up being the undoing of a compelling storyline.
Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2014,Aqua Plus,Real-Time | Fantasy | Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | Visual Novel | General,DarkZero,60,In the end Tears to Tiara II is a well put-together game that’s hard to recommend in the long run. Had the game chosen to either be a full-fledged Visual Novel with proper saving features or a more evenly-paced Strategy RPG it would have gotten a higher recommendation.
Band Hero,DS,Nov-3-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,1UP,58,When it comes to bringing the full complement of instruments to the DS Band Hero represents a very rocky start. If it werent for the games shortsighted and unintuitive peripherals there might actually be something worthwhile here -- assuming you dig the soundtrack anyhow.
Aven Colony,PC,Jul-25-2017,Mothership Entertainment,Strategy | Management | Government,PC PowerPlay,60,Tactical city-sim for the sub-menu-phobic. [Issue#265 p.58]
Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe,3DS,Aug-29-2014,HAL Labs,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,God is a Geek,50,Dedede’s Drum Dash Deluxe may be plentiful in Nintendo charm and character but ultimately the gameplay itself is one-note and over-stretched.
Antigraviator,PC,Jun-6-2018,Iceberg Interactive,Racing | Arcade | Futuristic,TheSixthAxis,60,Antigraviator has tons of potential and there’s every chance that it could attain it a few updates down its spiralling road. However as it stands there are too many problems with the game’s underpinnings that the fantastic visuals can’t quite cover up.
Obscure,PlayStation 2,Apr-6-2005,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror,GameZone,60,It doesn’t even have those pop-out-and-say-boo moments that the first two Resident Evil games were famous for. That combined with clunky gameplay and lame monsters make for one obscure game.
How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition,PlayStation 4,Nov-4-2014,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Survival,Eurogamer Italy,60,A cut-and-paste version of the PS3/Xbox 360 with a bunch of extra modes and features.
Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes,Wii,Oct-12-2010,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,60,Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes isnt a bad game. The problem is that there is so little depth in the gameplay that the experience can quickly grow old.
Bee Movie Game,PlayStation 2,Oct-30-2007,Beenox,Action | General,GameSpot,65,Younger players will enjoy the variety and sandbox-style freedom of Bee Movie Game.
Crash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2007,Radical Entertainment,Action | General | General,Thunderbolt,60,It isn’t as impressive as the original games were but overall Crash seems to be making titanic steps in the right direction.
NHL 08,PC,Sep-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,GameSpot,60,NHL 08 offers up a few control tweaks and minimal updates to the dynasty mode but thats about it.
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,55,A kinder control and save system wouldve been nice but as is Gladiator will test the limits of your gaming patience.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PC,Nov-15-2001,KnowWonder,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,64,It also seems to me that most of the budget for the game went into licensing. I cant see that a lot of effort was actually spent on the production of the game side of things.
Stretch Panic,PlayStation 2,Aug-28-2001,Treasure,Action Adventure | Fantasy,All Game Guide,50,The novelty of the idea soon gives way to awkward controlling and discombobulating camera angles resulting in an experience sometimes more frustrating than fun.
Off-Road Redneck Racing,PC,May-2-2001,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Armchair Empire,58,Redneck Racing (RR) is to Redneck Rampage what X-COM Enforcer is to X-COM. The flavor of RR is definitely taken from Rampage but you won’t be battling aliens.
Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition,Dreamcast,Oct-28-2000,Climax Entertainment,Driving | Mission-based,IGN,62,I can see the appeal that Super Runabout: SFE can have with younger players who dont know any better.
Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour,Dreamcast,Jul-19-2000,Crystal Dynamics,Driving | Racing | Kart,CNET Gamecenter,60,You dont have to be a pre-teen or Chip n Dale groupie to enjoy Magical Racing Tour but it sure does help.
Afro Samurai,PlayStation 3,Jan-27-2009,Namco Bandai Games America | Namco Bandai Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,VideoGamer,60,Fans of the show are likely to get a kick out of the solid virtual representation of the key characters and locations and will probably enjoy the combat for a few hours. Problems will become more and more intolerable though especially towards the end of the game where bosses are bordering on unfair and platforming sections repeatedly make you want to quit the game there and then. Hardcore fans of the genre are even less likely to get anything from the game.
Brothers in Arms: D-Day,PSP,Dec-5-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PSM3 Magazine UK,59,Dodgy controls and poor AI ruin what should have been a belter. [Feb 2007 p.74]
Lovely Planet,Xbox One,Jan-8-2016,QUICKTEQUILA,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,IGN Spain,60,One of those games that lies to the eye offering a deep and complicated proposal that only fall flat on delivering a wider variety of challenges.
Mini Ninjas Adventures,Xbox 360,Jun-29-2012,Side Kick LTD,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Italy,60,Cute visuals funny gameplay and pretty good Kinect controls for a mini-games compilation unfortunately too short and repetitive to appeal a broader audience.
Powerstar Golf,Xbox One,Nov-22-2013,Zoe Mode,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade,Meristation,60,Play golf using the cloud and customize your characters with perks and accessories by gaining experience. One of the most interesting downloadable games for Xbox One launch window in terms of contents. Its good value for money.
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,Xbox 360,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Digital Spy,60,The lack of substance and new ideas on last years title feels like a let-down while the career mode just does not have enough flourish to keep peoples attention. Factor in the dismal graphics and the weak online game and WRC: FIA World Rally Championship 2 feels like its languishing at the lower end of the racing game leaderboards.
Dead Space 2: Severed,PlayStation 3,Mar-1-2011,Visceral Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamereactor Sweden,60,Good atmosphere as expected but old levels and only a few hours of gameplay brings this down a bit.
Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli,Wii,Aug-26-2008,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Other | Other | GT / Street | Automobile,Gaming Age,50,The controls are challenging when using the motion set up and while the analog control is better its still not on par with a standard game pad set-up.
Just Cause 4,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Push Square,60,Just Cause 4s traversal system can be wonderfully entertaining and the chaotic explosion-sim physics in play are frequently exhilarating but theyre manacled to a game that has absolutely no idea how best to use them. Whats the point in giving players an array of tools that lets them cause wanton destruction on a gargantuan scale and then designing a campaign full of drab copy-pasted missions that barely require you to use them? Its a bit like getting the coolest BMX on the market for Christmas but then your Mum tells you youre only allowed to ride it around the garden where she can keep an eye on you. Cheers Mum.
Tekken Hybrid,PlayStation 3,Nov-22-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Gamer.nl,55,The original Tekken Tag Tournament is included and is the only part of this collection worth playing.
Brave: The Video Game,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,Disney Interactive Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Linear,Gamereactor Sweden,60,Nice battles and nice pacing but the production values could have been higher.
Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code,PSP,Mar-28-2006,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Eurogamer,60,An average entry-level action RPG. If youre a heavy user of wizards and orcs youll have probably played something very similar only last week.
Skully,Switch,Aug-4-2020,Finish Line Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendo Life,60,Skully isn’t an entirely lost cause. There’s an entertaining enough puzzle platformer hidden underneath its myriad visual flaws. It may be uglier than sin and you may be accompanied by an irritating voiceover throughout but you’ll still have some fun playing through it and the plot does resolve itself in a nice way by the end. Youll just need to be able to roll with a lot of annoyances to get there.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2,PlayStation Vita,Aug-18-2015,Frima Studio,Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,IGN Spain,60,Not the best port made for PS Vita nor the best survival horror that we remember. Technically flawed still manages to entertain for around 6 hours.
Farming Simulator 2013,PC,Oct-25-2012,Giants Software,Miscellaneous | General | Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,CD-Action,60,This is not a product for a typical gamer and has plenty of shortcomings but it does fit lazy afternoons pretty well. But on the other hand so does blowing into ocarina… [1/2013 p.74]
Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Battle March,PC,Sep-2-2008,Black Hole Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpy,60,A tragically missed opportunity. There are hints of an excellent Total War-style real-time tactics game married to the undeniable crazy charm of the Warhammer Fantasy universe.
Crayola Treasure Adventures,DS,Oct-1-2007,Crave,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Thunderbolt,60,Its a good game but theres isnt much to it apart from colouring which is the whole point.
Delta Force: Xtreme,PC,Apr-22-2005,NovaLogic,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Gamer,58,This one will move a few units at Wal-Mart but no more. [July 2005 p.69]
Battleship,Xbox One,Aug-2-2016,Frima Studio,Miscellaneous | Board / Card Game,Attack of the Fanboy,60,Battleship is one of the original board games and has managed to stand the test of time over the years and now Frima Studio has managed to reinvigorate its core gameplay by adding more strategy than ever.
Depth,PC,Nov-3-2014,Digital Confectioners,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameSpot,50,Depth is the closest Ive come to experiencing the kind of fear a game about killer sharks should generate since my younger days of playing Jaws on the NES. Future updates that clean up bugs and add new content could help it breach the surface and approach greatness. Until then however Depth floats listlessly in the ocean current.
Titan Quest,Switch,Jul-31-2018,THQ Nordic,Role-Playing | Action RPG,SpazioGames,60,This new version of Titan Quest shows so many failures and problems about graphic and technique maybe due to the low quality of the whole work done too fast and with less content than the previous editions alas.
James Bond 007: Blood Stone,PlayStation 3,Nov-2-2010,Bizarre Creations,Action | Driving | Shooter | Mission-based | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gameblog.fr,60,Blood Stone has been a weird experience for me. Its playability is dynamic but wonky its production values are really inconsistent its linearity fades a little when playing in difficult mode its solo durability isnt so great but its multiplayer remains nice (though not great) and the non-stop action would be charming if there wasnt that repetitiveness. Pros and cons to sum it up. Blood Stone will not be a future reference thats for sure but Bond fans may still enjoy it.
ZEN Pinball 2: Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron,PlayStation 4,Apr-22-2015,Zen Studios,Action | Pinball,Gaming Age,50,On the positive side I did like the idea of a two-ball multiball prelude to open the table up with where you help Iron Man construct the Ultron A.I. It’s also somewhat neat to see it built as an optional thing even though I’m not sure I fully understand why you would want to skip it. Also if you manage to get the four-ball multiball for the final event it’s so chaotic that you can’t help but smile at the mess even if getting to this point is more frustrating and boring than it’s worth.
Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave Incident,Wii,Jun-29-2011,Sanzaru Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Hidden Object | Puzzle | General,Nintendo Power,60,Despite a few high points you can safely file this game under not bad but entirely skippable. [July 2011 p.88]
Zombie Panic in Wonderland,Wii,May-3-2010,Akaoni Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,60,I enjoyed the vibe of the game and the shooting can be fun in short spurts. The fun factor and the price however dont quite level out.
Daemonica,PC,Mar-31-2006,Cinemax | RA Images,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,PC Gamer,59,Daemonica is not the kind of RPG that will appeal to most hardcore gamers. [July 2006 p.77]
Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta,Xbox 360,Aug-3-2009,Bethesda Softworks,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,Destructoid,60,Do yourself a favor and purchase any of the other four Fallout downloadable content packs before even contemplating getting this one.
Urban Trial Tricky,Switch,Jun-25-2020,Tate Multimedia,Sports | Individual | Biking,Starbit,60,Urban Trial Tricky is simple...simple and fun and its good at what it does. While the game doesnt harbour AAA ambitions this is without a doubt a very fun way to pass some time and to enjoy the kicks and adrenaline rushes given by performing stunts on a bike. The experience would be better if the levels felt a little less claustrophobic but as a quick fun experience Urban Trial Tricky is a welcome addition to the Nintendo Switch catalogue.
Dead or School,Switch,Mar-13-2020,Studio Nanafushi,Action Adventure | General,NintendoWorldReport,65,The gameplay and exploration of Dead or School are surprisingly addictive but enough small issues give me pause in fully recommending it. Grinding for levels constantly upgrading your equipment and completing sidequests for stat boosts are all practically required. Its very likely youll encounter multiple final bosses that you simply arent prepared for. Fortunately many enemies respawn and save points refill your health and ammo in addition to functioning as waypoints. Fanservice images pop up from time to time but they arent overly egregious and shouldnt dissuade you from a purchase. If you can look past its numerous imperfections Dead or School is a satisfying and compelling albeit janky action-platformer that may be worth getting a hall pass for.
Conarium,PlayStation 4,Feb-12-2019,Zoetrope Interactive,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,PlayStation LifeStyle,60,When looking back at my time with the game I don’t feel horror at its revelations. I feel disappointment in light of what it could have been concealing and simply wasn’t.
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,PC,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,WHAM! Gaming,55,The joystick obviously offers the best option for control but the preset controls for the game are quite odd and for me at least changing the layout was not possible.
Serious Sam: Next Encounter,PlayStation 2,Apr-22-2004,Climax Group,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Game Chronicles,58,If you’re sitting at home in your ripped jeans watching Army of Darkness on VHS and have a crumpled Jackson in your pocket this game is not only calling you it’s running at you screaming with a hissing bomb in its hands.
Naval Ops: Commander,PlayStation 2,Mar-9-2004,Micro Cabin,Simulation | Ship,Cheat Code Central,50,I feel the game is lacking in direction. It feels like a make-work project with too-similar objectives and the putting of parts together. As far as Im concerned this game is just a piece of ship.
Conflict: Desert Storm II - Back to Baghdad,PC,Oct-7-2003,Pivotal Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,Eurogamer,60,For those expecting massive advancements or a radical departure from the original this will come as a disappointment. A more honest realistic assessment would be to treat this as a mission pack and for those who do just want more of the same youll come away a satisfied customer.
Disciples II: Servants of the Dark,PC,Jun-30-2003,Strategy First,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Computer Games Magazine,60,Scenario design in the new campaigns is overly reliant on puzzles. [Oct 2003 p.95]
Worms Blast,GameCube,Oct-24-2002,Team17,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,Game Revolution,58,Has the core of great puzzle game from the range of game modes to the interesting characters. Unfortunately the sluggish if workable controls put a damper on the overall feel.
Mega Man X6,PlayStation,Dec-4-2001,Capcom,Action | Platformer | 2D,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,Actually worse than its recent predecessors. [Feb 2002 p.116]
ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2001,Konami,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GameSpot,55,The game does have a solid and innovative franchise mode but given the available choices for football sims on the console it is tough to recommend.
Tetris Worlds,Game Boy Advance,Sep-5-2001,3d6 Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,Pocket Games,60,Great multiplayer support gives it a long lifespan though little ingenuity is here. [Winter 2001 p.52]
Razor Freestyle Scooter,PlayStation,Dec-11-2000,Shaba Games,Action | General,GameSpot,66,Seasoned fans of the freestyle sports genre will whip through Razor Freestyle Scooter in an afternoon no questions asked. It doesnt offer up any real variety in its challenges.
Gunman Chronicles,PC,Nov-19-2000,Rewolf Software,Action | General | General,Gaming Age,58,Gunman Chronicles isnt a terrible game I just suspect many of us have been there and done that.
Eat Them!,PlayStation 3,Dec-21-2010,FluffyLogic,Action | General | General,GameSpot,60,Laying waste to cities is fun but frustrating objectives and stiff difficulty prevent Eat Them from being a monstrously good time.
Trillion: God of Destruction,PlayStation Vita,Mar-29-2016,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Everyeye.it,60,Leaving behind the renowned lands of Gamindustri Idea Factory and Compile Heart present a new IP. Trillion: God of Destruction is a confused mixture of interesting ideas a good starting point for a series but nothing more than this.
Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns,DS,Jul-22-2008,Ninja Studio,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Roguelike,NintendoWorldReport,60,I’m not a fan of the presentation or the ridiculous grinding required for success.
007: Quantum of Solace,DS,Nov-4-2008,Vicarious Visions,Action | Action Adventure | General | Modern | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Nintendo Power,60,The games ideas are good but the execution doesnt cut it. [Jan 2009 p.90]
Fossil League: Dino Tournament Championship,DS,Jan-22-2007,MTO,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG,GamesRadar+,60,We really wish you could battle using multiple dinos at once but in the end the combination of paleontology and Pokemon won us over.
Eternal Poison,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2008,Flight-Plan,Strategy | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),70,Eternal Poison is built around three separate campaigns each with their own leading characters and unique encounters so theres plenty of built-in replay value. [Jan 2009 p.82]
Axis & Allies,PC,Nov-2-2004,TimeGate Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,Jolt Online Gaming UK,55,It’s not an awful game by any scale but it is tepid and flawed in its execution.
Journey of a Roach,PC,Nov-4-2013,Koboldgames,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Hooked Gamers,54,There are plenty of other games out there with more interesting puzzles and a more mature storyline. If your kids have a particular penchant for pests though this might be a decent game to play with them.
MotoGP 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-28-2008,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,AceGamez,60,This is the first time that the MotoGP licence has been in the hands of Capcom as publishers and Milestone as developers. The result is a solid game that doesnt really improve on last years offering. By setting its sights on accessibility MotoGP 08 seems to lose its focus on who its for and ends up providing something for everyone but not everything for anyone.
Dig Dug: Digging Strike,DS,Oct-18-2005,Bullets,Action | Platformer | General | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Armchair Empire,60,Simply lacks any lasting appeal. While it may be tempting to say that long-time fans of the series may get a kick out of the game if they’re purists they’ll likely have a problem with the gameplay tweaks added for this installment.
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts,PlayStation 4,Nov-22-2019,CI Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,While making a tricky headshot is always satisfying the environments enemies tasks and plot simply don’t grab your attention in the way they need to. It doesn’t help that the dull enemy dialogue where present has a tendency to loop if you linger nearby. AI is greatly improved from the last game but there are still line-of-sight issues. Ultimately the experience doesn’t have the tension of Sniper Elite nor the ingeniousness or replayability of Hitman. Sadly SGWC misses its mark. [Issue@#171 p.92]
Battle Princess Madelyn,Switch,Dec-20-2018,Causal Bit Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gameblog.fr,60,Battle Princess Madelyn tries to deliver a new twist to the old Ghostsn Goblins formula. Unfortunately its broken level design forbids Causal Games homage to reach the same heights as Arthurs adventure. With no clues on what to do or where to go even players looking for a tough challenge will only consider the arcade mode worthy of interest if they want to enjoy the games gorgeous graphics and art direction.
Poi: Explorer Edition,Switch,Oct-23-2017,PolyKid,Action | Platformer | 3D,Switch Player,60,Poi: Explorer Edition is a nice budget 3D platformer that is perfect for younger Nintendo Switch owners. The challenges in the game can become rather repetitive but if you are looking for a colourful platformer that is inoffensive and fun then you cant go too wrong with Poi!
Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,Namco Bandai Games | Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,TheSixthAxis,60,While Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment is an enjoyable budget release that offers hours of anime adventuring it’s tainted by inexplicable performance issues that simply shouldn’t have made it to the PS4 edition of the game.
Fairy Fencer F,PlayStation 3,Sep-16-2014,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,3DJuegos,60,A so-so JRPG based upon the mechanics established on the Hyperdimension Neptunia saga.
A Virus Named TOM,PC,Aug-1-2012,Misfits Attic,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,PC PowerPlay,60,Like trying to solve a cryptic crossword whilst blind and being repeatedly stung by mosquitoes. [Oct 2012 p.82]
Shotest Shogi,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2008,AI Factory | Rubicon Development Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,GameSpot,60,Shotest Shogi is a challenging experience that relies on you having at least a passing familiarity with the tabletop game that its based on.
007: Quantum of Solace,PlayStation 3,Nov-4-2008,Treyarch,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamestyle,60,Quantum of Solace is by no means a poor first person experience its just rather bland and decidedly average.
Barnyard,Wii,Dec-4-2006,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action | Adventure | General | General,GamesRadar+,60,Ultimately Barnyard is an easy mildly entertaining grab bag of minigames and missions. Kids will undoubtedly enjoy the game and their parents will find themselves sucked into numerous minigames as well.
Pac-Man World 3,Xbox,Nov-17-2005,Blitz Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Jolt Online Gaming UK,55,A painfully routine affair then and a missed opportunity to boot.
Dynasty Warriors 9,PlayStation 4,Feb-13-2018,Omega Force,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 3D,Attack of the Fanboy,60,Dynasty Warriors 9 felt more like an experiment than a single cohesive experience. At times it felt like Dynasty Warriors sometimes an open world RPG occasionally neither and sometimes both. But if Omega Force learns from this endeavor and buckles down for the next entry the result could be spectacular.
Super Motherload,PlayStation 4,Nov-15-2013,XGenStudios,General | Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action,Metro GameCentral,60,The visuals may make even Knack look like a system seller but there’s a quiet pleasure to Super Motherload’s simple but addictive gameplay.
SingStar Dance,PlayStation 3,Nov-1-2010,SCEE London Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Dancing,Da Gameboyz,60,For those that enjoy karaoke on the PS3 or enjoy SingStar games SingStar Dance is most likely a no-brainer so you might as well treat yourself. That being said it will cost you some coin to get a decent library of songs and the dancing elements in the game simply stink.
War the Game,PC,Jan-12-2015,GabberGames,Strategy | Real-Time | Military,DarkStation,60,If you want more story higher production quality and more layers of control that is fine but try looking elsewhere. If you are like me and not the greatest strategy player in the world but still want to feel the thrill of managing an army to victory then this game is for you.
MachiaVillain,PC,May-16-2018,Wild Factor,Action | General,GameSpace,65,It’s a fun and zany game with a quirky art style (feels similar to Don’t Starve) but it can be cumbersome. Also the randomization can hurt: I had to start several games over from minute 1 when there wasn’t enough free space to start building my haunted house. Also… the ability to have multiple stories would be nice. Haunted basements anyone? Attics?
Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D,3DS,Jun-28-2011,Capcom,Action | Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Shooter | Survival | Third-Person | Tactical,PALGN,60,Quality gameplay squandered by clumsy design The Mercenaries 3D misses the opportunity to become the definitive The Mercenaries game instead settling for a passing distraction.
Cate West: The Vanishing Files,Wii,Mar-23-2009,Destineer,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Boomtown,60,The gameplay itself is pretty average for the genre and the graphics do make it a bit difficult to spot some of the objects you are looking for but its plus points more than compensate. The games storyline holds the average gameplay together well the overall presentation is pretty good and to top it all off is the games budget price.
Birthdays the Beginning,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Arc System Works,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon | Action Adventure | Sandbox,IGN Spain,60,Birthdays the Beginning may be fun but it also has a very plain gameplay. A game that may be fun for the usual management players but with a very modest visual look.
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,Xbox,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Gaming Age,58,If the gameplay was a little more involved with less button bashing and greater emphasis on using combos for effectiveness it would provide a more fufilling experience.
EyePet & Friends,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,SCEE London Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Worth Playing,60,EyePet & Friends could have been a cute game for kids who want to play with a virtual and exotic pet.
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands,PSP,May-17-2010,Ubisoft Quebec,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,60,Aside from the disappointing revelation toward the end of the game Prince of Persia is a solid experience on the PSP. It expertly treads the line between giving us a taste of what exists on the consoles and offering unique and challenging gameplay that is suited to the handheld. If not for the sloppy missteps I would say that the Forgotten Sands would be a worthy addition to anyones PSP library.
The Escapists: The Walking Dead,Xbox One,Sep-30-2015,Team17,Action | General,COGconnected,65,While I wasn’t a fan of the resource management and crafting system as a whole due to frustration and lack of hints those with patience and who love experimentation will no doubt see hours pass by as they try to survive one more day to find that one item you’ve been searching for.
Exit 2,Xbox 360,Feb-25-2009,Taito Corporation,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,Official Xbox Magazine,60,It all moves at such a slow pace that theres no feeling of excitement or achievement in finishing a level. [May 2009 p.84]
M.A.C.H. Modified Air Combat Heroes,PSP,Feb-20-2007,VU Games,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Other,IGN,59,Although the gameplay is fun and the controls are easy to master the fact that you can play the game for half an hour and see just about everything possible makes M.A.C.H. an experience you dont need to plunk your hard-earned money to purchase.
Help Wanted: 50 Wacky Jobs,Wii,May-12-2009,Hudson Soft,Simulation | General | General,GamesRadar+,60,More successful as a single-player experience which can be seen as good or bad depending on your inclination.
Gauntlet,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,Digital Eclipse,Action | General | General | Arcade,Game Chronicles,60,Hardcore Gauntlet players will probably buy yet another copy of this game if for no other reason than the ability to play multiplayer over Xbox Live which is admittedly a good reason to play what is otherwise a very dated and boring game that will try your patience rather than test your RPG skills.
Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain,PlayStation 2,May-4-2004,Sony Bend,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,Gamenikki,60,Cooperative multiplayer and the basic gunplay thrills dont quite make up for bad control and ugly graphics.
Lords of the Realm III,PC,Mar-17-2004,Impressions Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General,netjak,62,Gameplay is horrendously simple...Ultimately Lords of the Realm 3 was a big letdown. It is still a rather decent game but nowhere near as deep as its predecessor.
Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus,Xbox,Mar-18-2003,Studio Gigante,Action | Fighting | 3D,Electronic Gaming Monthly,45,Playing Tao Feng is a lot like diarrhea; the longer it lasts the more irritated you get. [May 2003 p.134]
Strike Fighters: Project 1,PC,Oct-27-2002,Third Wire,Simulation | Flight | Old Jet | Combat,Armchair Empire,60,Civilians steer clear: this is definitely one for the flyboys.
S.W.I.N.E.,PC,Nov-19-2001,Stormregion,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Tactics,ActionTrip,57,Not only is the game easy and uninventive but it also has few units a poor AI and happens to be one of the least stable games I played in a long time.
Tennis Masters Series,PC,Nov-18-2001,Microids,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,GameSpot,59,Sluggish controls paper-thin career mode fictitious players and mediocre court graphics.
Hoard,PC,Apr-4-2011,Big Sandwich Games | Inc.,Action | General | General,XGN,60,Although the basic gameplay of Hoard is fun and entertaining the game offers little content. Its also a game that you have to play with friends. Luckily all of the game modes are playable online.
Juiced: Eliminator,PSP,Jun-28-2006,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Eurogamer,60,Its a content-packed well-produced handheld game - they can put that on the box if they want - but the racings a bit boring the load-delays are too regular and too long its very punishing when you start getting somewhere and the lack of online options hurts it.
Party Hard,PlayStation 4,Apr-26-2016,Pinokl Games,Action | General,IGN Denmark,50,If it had been balanced for faster gameplay with more traps Party Hard would actually have been a fun action game. As it is now though the party never really gets going.
MS Saga: A New Dawn,PlayStation 2,Feb-21-2006,Bandai,Role-Playing | General,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,MS Saga succeeds in creating one of the first truly accessible Gundam experiences while still giving the hardcore fans a reason to play. [Mar 2006 p.87]
Away: Shuffle Dungeon,DS,Oct-30-2008,Mistwalker | Artoon,Role-Playing | General | General,GamePro,60,An innovative and quirky experiment Away: Shuffle Dungeon never quite rises above simple hack-and-slash mediocrity.
Wild West Guns,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Gameloft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,Cheat Code Central,58,Though the presentation is tight the gameplay is quite dated and repetitive and at $10 (and 300 blocks of Wii memory) its no bargain.
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PSP,Dec-11-2005,Crave,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,50,The simple infrastructure multiplayer adds some replay value but overall this port is poorly thought out. [Mar 2006 p.97]
Crash 'N' Burn,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Arcade,G4 TV,60,This is not a game that will wow players with its graphics or its crash effects which are more half-cocked than insane but aggressive drivers who want to blow off steam will find Crash N Burn to be a smashing success.
Need for Speed Underground 2,DS,May-10-2005,EA Canada,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GameSpy,60,Although the game isnt on the same level as its console counterparts the DS version holds its own.
Painkiller: Overdose,PC,Oct-26-2007,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Positive,58,Overdose suffers most from its overall lack of polish. Had the levels and balancing received a bit more attention this could have been another solid entry in the Painkiller series. There is still some mindless enjoyment to be had here but the dated presentation and slow loading times conspire to spoil that too.
Bee Simulator,Switch,Nov-12-2019,Varsav Game Studios,Simulation | General,Switch Player,50,Bee Simulator is a charming game but one that never fully realises its potential as a true simulator. While at times gameplay was enjoyable the overall experience felt limited and the experience was more akin to an interactive educational tale.
Morphite,Switch,Nov-2-2017,Crescent Moon Games,Action Adventure | General,Cubed3,40,While it has all the makings of a long-lasting space adventure Morphite lacks any real emotion in the story it tries to tell while lacking the denizens to populate the various planets found within. Everything feels quite empty and lifeless made further haunting by Myrahs need to scan everything on the planet while breaking into temples to steal the rare Morphites that turn out to be…not so rare. This feels more like a concept piece for a brand new title and its hard to justify this as a purchase for what it offers currently. The story is bland the procedural worlds are even blander and the side-quests are completely broken and poorly maintained.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,DS,Nov-14-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer's Hell,63,A big mix of somewhat clumsy gameplay and great use of the environmental conditions of the land of Narnia.
Arena Football,Xbox,Feb-7-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,GamePro,50,While the overall control scheme works well enough kicking long range field goals through the notoriously tight uprights is far too simple. The limited playbook also gives the game a stale feeling and the half baked telemetry system fails to save the gameplay with largely unimportant statistical minutia delivered in eye-straining small fonts and obnoxious menus.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1: In Too Deep,Xbox One,Feb-23-2016,Skybound LLC | Skybound Games,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Twinfinite,60,The Walking Dead: Michonne is off to a decent start with plenty of room for improvement. Most of the new characters may feel like zombie fodder but they’ve got some interesting personalities that will be fun to follow. Plus Michonne may be immortal in the game but that doesn’t mean she won’t get banged up along the way through both physically and mentally demanding trials.
Sparkle 2,Xbox One,Jan-27-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Puzzle | Matching,Official Xbox Magazine UK,60,Probably better suited to a smartphone but mildly diverting for an hour or two. [March 2016 p.87]
Prince of Persia Revelations,PSP,Dec-6-2005,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Fantasy | Linear,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,60,Abundant faults make it impossible to recommend this over the original. Save your money and get Warrior Within second-hand on PS2 instead. [Feb 2006 p.98]
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2005,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,Gaming Nexus,60,Long on style and short on substance.
Outward,Xbox One,Mar-26-2019,Nine Dots Studio,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Survival | Open-World,Cultured Vultures,60,Though filled with interesting ideas and mechanics Outward is let down by poor combat dated visuals and performance issues.
Choplifter HD,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2012,InXile Entertainment,General | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,XboxAddict,58,While the game in its essence is a side scrolling adventure the frustrations of combining poor gaming controls with a lackluster HD graphic remake and next to nothing audio work make the 1200 MS point price tag an undisputed rip off of the gaming community.
Cookie & Cream,DS,Jul-2-2007,Hi Corp,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,50,If youre going to compete with the likes of Mario and Sonic you need a smart plan. And if you have a smart plan you better make it work. Cookie & Cream is only half way there. [Dec 2007 p.87]
Secret Files: Tunguska,Wii,Jun-22-2010,10tacle Studios | Fusionsphere Systems,Adventure | Third-Person | General | Modern,Jolt Online Gaming UK,60,While its true that Secret Files: Tunguska does get one or two brownie points for being in what’s currently a very sparsely populated genre on the Wii the fact that it’s so middling in just about every respect hardly justifies a purchase.
Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon,PC,Aug-21-2008,Kheops Studio,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,GameZone,60,This title is too conventional for its own good. Ultimately there’s no compelling real reason to pick this one up unless you just have to have another fix of the vampire mythos and don’t mind gameplay that can feel more like drudgery than fun.
The Awakened Fate: Ultimatum,PlayStation 3,Mar-17-2015,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | General | Roguelike,Multiplayer.it,55,Despite its cute look The Awakened Fate Ultimatum is a surprisingly dark and gloomy story which becomes borderline frustrating too soon and gives too little in return.
Blacklight: Tango Down,PC,Jul-14-2010,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,Absolute Games,60,Despite a lucratively low price Blacklight has no future. Modern Warfare 2 and Bad Company 2 are much better replacements if you want to just shoot at somebody and if youre itching for some classic multiplayer gameplay Counter-Strike Source is an excellent remedy for nostalgia.
Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,PC,Jun-10-2016,Frogwares,Adventure | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Sherlock took a few long steps away from the adventure toward the action gaming again. Although someone might actually like this change fans of the original game won’t be satisfied. [Issue#265]
Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond,PlayStation 3,Jan-7-2010,Vicious Cycle,Action | Action Adventure | Modern | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Fiddly controls. [Mar 2010 p.111]
Blair Witch,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,PlayStation LifeStyle,55,Ultimately Blair Witch is an intriguing story plagued by unsatisfactory gameplay with a few neat ideas sprinkled throughout. Your canine companion presents some interesting mechanics along with altering time through the camcorders but in the end even these features aren’t enough to save Blair Witch from being a chore to play. There’s still some to appreciate like the characters and story which make Blair Witch almost enjoyable.
Metal Wolf Chaos XD,PC,Aug-6-2019,From Software | General Arcade,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,Attack of the Fanboy,70,Metal Wolf Chaos XD is a totally unique experience that is worthwhile for anyone whos a fan of early 2000s action or satirical and off-the-wall humor.
Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 2,Xbox One,Feb-5-2019,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,XboxAddict,58,As someone who enjoys this genre and always has I wish that Milestone could strike gold and usher in a new heyday of off-road racing games. They have some building blocks in place but need to try to take more time with their games and polish them more before release. Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Video Game 2 is hurt by this lack of polish as well as some dated mechanics and middling gameplay leaving it a mediocre racer overall.
Smash Hit Plunder,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,Triangular Pixels,Strategy | General,Screen Rant,60,Smash Hit Plunder delivers an entertaining and colorful distraction. Smashing hitting and plundering is unquestionably enjoyable and while there isn’t a grand scope of variety puzzling out the best objects to break or hitting a scurrying creature with a carefully thrown crate feels just as good the tenth or twentieth time you do it. It may not make utmost use of all of the tools in the VR toolbox but Smash Hit Plunder is a lighthearted diversion that is worth your time and will probably be a big hit with younger gamers.
Gekido: Kintaro's Revenge,Switch,Mar-22-2018,Naps Team,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Nintendo Life,60,Gekido: Kintaros Revenge is a love letter to the original Game Boy Advance game that many probably didn’t notice was pushing the envelope as far as graphics animation music and presentation were expected on Nintendo’s 32-bit handheld. As such and despite excellent added extras to this Switch package it stubbornly restrains itself in the past and as is only truly recommended if you fell nostalgic towards the original game.
Human: Fall Flat,Switch,Dec-7-2017,No Brakes Games,Action Adventure | General,Vgames,55,Human: Fall Flat is a nice puzzle game with funny mechanics that make the first few hours engaging and good but after that the game can get quite frustrating and annoying. The game experience is improved during Co-Op plays but in regards to the game as a whole Human: Fall Flat falls flat.
Star Wars Battlefront II,PC,Nov-17-2017,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,PCGamesN,60,Star Wars Battlefront II houses a decent single-player campaign and good multiplayer but like the otherwise slick design of its multiplayer maps that accomplishment is often obscured by distractions. Normally my brain blocks out in-game monetisation letting me enjoy the game for what it is. Battlefront II changes that because spenders get a real advantage here. You cannot help but notice it encroaching on everything plastered all over the game’s convoluted drawn-out progression system.
Xenoraid,PlayStation 4,Nov-8-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons Ltd | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Twinfinite,60,When there are games out there like Rez and Geometry Wars that reinvent that chassis it’s difficult to play something like Xenoraid and feel… well much at all.
Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,ACE Team,Action Adventure | Linear,PlayStation LifeStyle,55,Far from a bad title as it does a great job of keeping some tension with its lite roguelike design and it contains more than enough content to warrant its $14.99 price tag. But if you’re like me and are particular about how a game should feel on a fundamental level then you may find that this one is lacking where it matters most.
War for the Overworld,PC,Apr-2-2015,Subterranean Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Eurogamer Poland,60,Interesting proposition especially for fans of the iconic Dungeon Keeper. For everyone else theres monotony and mild irritation.
Rio,PlayStation 3,Apr-12-2011,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Miscellaneous | General | General,GameOver.gr,50,Just another mediocre movie tie-in in the fashion of all the similar games that have preceded it and probably many of the ones that will follow it. It could be enjoyable but just for kids and only for a couple of hours. Thats about it.
Rogue Ops,GameCube,Oct-29-2003,Bits Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,AceGamez,60,Control although not debilitating ruins what could have been a very slick title and its similarity to Splinter Cell is brazen even down to the tutorial which is straight out of the Sam Fisher handbook.
Summer Heat Beach Volleyball,PlayStation 2,Jul-1-2003,Acclaim Studios Cheltenham,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,Electronic Gaming Monthly,63,Heats mushy [control] scheme relies too heavily on context making your beach bunny set when you intended an unstoppable spike and its overbearing interface banishes guesswork (and psych-out strategy) from the game. Still the virtual volleyball action is fast-paced fun. [Sept 2003 p.112]
Gungrave,PlayStation 2,Sep-16-2002,Seta Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,GameSpot,51,Gungrave definitely looks cool. Its also a textbook case for why great graphics dont do you much good if the underlying game is shallow.
Mad Maestro!,PlayStation 2,Mar-12-2002,Desert Productions,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Total Video Games,60,You get the feeling that this could be a nice little game that is more than the sum of it’s parts but sadly this is not the case.
Darkened Skye,PC,Jan-27-2002,Boston Animation,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Fantasy,ActionTrip,53,A game meant for gamers who are a bit younger and who enjoy cute sarcastic babes for main characters. So it all boils down to jumping around bashing recurring enemies with your staff and listening to your un-witty sidekick.
Monsters Inc. Scream Team,PlayStation,Oct-30-2001,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General,GameSpot,54,More sophisticated players will likely find this 3D platformer to be too repetitive and easy.
Thunderstrike: Operation Phoenix,PlayStation 2,Oct-15-2001,Core Design Ltd.,Action | Simulation | Shooter | Flight | Third-Person | Helicopter | Modern,Electronic Gaming Monthly,50,Later sorties throw so much annoying crap at you—too many enemies who pop out of nowhere too many mission objectives. [Jan 2002 p.222]
Yoshi's New Island,3DS,Mar-14-2014,Arzest,Action | Platformer | 2D,Eurogamer Spain,60,Yoshis New Island lacks that magic and special touch that only Nintendo knows how to apply to their products. Without that its a soulless platform game one that makes no big mistakes but never manages to surprise or even stand out from the crowd.
Alpha Protocol,PlayStation 3,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Theres just an awkward charm in its klutziness but Alpha Protocol is a tough one to love. [July 2010 p.112]
Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2014,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,USgamer,60,You probably know what youre getting into if youre picking up Dynasty Warriors Gundam Reborn. Any resemblance it might have to depth is purely superficial.
F1 2015,Xbox One,Jul-21-2015,Codemasters,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Game Informer,65,Once again Codemasters has created an F1 game thats true to the studios driving pedigree but fails on other fronts. It looks nice and drives well but unless youre so caught up in the F1 season that you absolutely have to sate your cravings with a video game you may have already played this game and put it down.
Monopoly Streets,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,Electronic Arts,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Vandal,60,If you like Monopoly youll like Monopoly Streets. But it you like it you will probably already have the table-top game at home and would prefer to play it without watching a television. But its virtue lies in the possibility to set up specific rules and add additional extras to a basic formula specially in online modes.
Danger Zone,PC,May-29-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,PC Gamer,53,This is a game about crashing that feels restrained almost sterile. [Aug 2017 p.87]
Diner Dash: Sizzle & Serve,DS,May-23-2007,Climax Group | PlayFirst | Climax Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General | Action,GameSpy,60,Even though the difficulty ramps up dramatically halfway through Career mode dedicated gamers will be able to complete the whole thing in a day if they dont get tired of the somewhat shallow and repetitive gameplay before then.
Mario Party 7,GameCube,Nov-7-2005,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Party,Deeko,60,Doesnt offer up anything different here with the exception of some new minigames and a freshly themed game board.
Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis,PC,Oct-29-2009,Fusionsphere Systems | Animation Arts,Adventure | General | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Lame voice cast destroys the atmosphere of this traditional adventure game. But there are some catching moments which make Puritas Cordis worth playing...pity there are only a few of those moments. [July 2009]
Spyro: A Hero's Tail,Xbox,Nov-3-2004,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,GameSpot,58,Spyros newly expanded roster doesnt manage to save A Heros Tail from monotony and even the titles targeted younger demographic will probably soon tire of the games reliance on boring collectible gathering.
Onimusha Tactics,Game Boy Advance,Nov-11-2003,Capcom,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Gamestyle,60,This isnt a bad game but in comparison to the heavyweights of the genre it just doesnt offer enough. An interesting diversion then but one that probably wont last you for very long.
AO Tennis 2,Switch,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,Nintendo Life,50,There’s a genuinely brilliant game hidden away somewhere in AO Tennis 2 but you need to have the patience of a saint to put up with its horrendous frame rate issues and the impact they have on its already tricky stroke timing system. The Career mode is a joy and the level of customisation and user creations is unlike anything we’ve ever seen in a tennis game so tennis fans may still want to give it a look as long as they can cope with its infuriatingly erratic performance. It may not be a popular thing to say on a Nintendo site but if you have access to another system you may want to look into how it runs on that instead.
Bloo Kid 2,3DS,May-7-2015,winterworks,Action | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,60,Bloo Kid 2 is a fun and competent platform game which perfectly captures the spirit of late 80s and early 90s platformers...perhaps a bit too much as it resorts to blatant copying of some of the biggest names in the field.
Naval War: Arctic Circle,PC,Apr-10-2012,Turbo Tape Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General,GamesBeat,59,As much as I enjoy some of the oddball strategy games available I cant bring myself to recommend this to even the most ardent grognards.
Go Vacation,Wii,Oct-11-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Eurogamer Italy,50,Another mini-game collection designed for young children and families. With Go Vacation Namco Bandai tried to make something different but they forgot one main ingredient in the recipe: the fun.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Autobots,DS,Jun-23-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Adventure | Shooter | Beat-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person | 3D | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,58,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen on DS is a whole lot better than the terrible movie and a decent action game in its own right. The online Battle for Earth mode offers new content for months to come but don’t be tricked into buying both the autobots and decepticons versions of the game—they’re basically the same thing with a different coat of paint.
Gear.Club Unlimited,Switch,Nov-21-2017,Eden Games Mobile,Action | General | Racing | Simulation | Automobile,GamePro Germany,58,A quite passable arcade racer with licensed race cars and with cleary noticable free-to-play roots.
Lucky's Tale,PC,Mar-28-2016,Playful Corp.,Action | Platformer | 3D,Edge Magazine,60,Despite its names implications this is a better game when youre following Luckys nose rather than his tail. [Tested with Oculus Rift; June 2016 p.119]
Crystal Quest,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2006,Stainless Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,TeamXbox,61,Crystal Quest tries its hardest to bring a slower variation of the style and substance that Geometry Wars so expertly crafted but it falls short of delivering the overall fun factor that other XBLA games have.
Atari Classics Evolved,PSP,Dec-19-2007,Stainless Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,AceGamez,60,The evolved angle isnt worth much unless you really want the ultimate Warlords experience (which is admittedly awesome).
Dusk Diver,PlayStation 4,Oct-29-2019,JFi Games,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,60,Dusk Diver is a noble idea. After all its clearly inspired by the likes of Persona and there arent many better sources of inspiration out there. Im also right on board with the setting. Having never been to Ximending I was quite keen to see what its like through the lens of this game. I didnt get to do that though because the game failed to capture the characteristics or community of the district. It was another hub-style location for another anime game. Throw in a functional but hardly boundary-pushing combat system and youre left with something that works but at this particular time of year a workmanlike experience is just going to drown under the weight of all the other really good stuff being released sadly.
Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2012,Pyramid,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Eurogamer Portugal,60,This collection is only worthwhile because of Budokai 3. It would be preferable if it were released individually on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.
Conduit 2,Wii,Apr-19-2011,High Voltage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamesRadar+,60,Sadly aside from a sharp online Wii experience Conduit 2 rarely impresses relying too much on generic drudgery and sad attempts to capture the magic of more popular titles; worse yet the storyline and characters seem aimless and forgettable.
Defiance,PC,Apr-2-2013,Trion Worlds,Massively Multiplayer Online | Role-Playing | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,60,Defiance is an interesting mix between an MMO and a FPS fun to play and with many things to do. Too bad for the poor AI and a certain lack of variety.
Battles of Prince of Persia,DS,Dec-6-2005,Ubisoft Montreal,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,NintendoWorldReport,55,Though the games stylus-based controls are tight and for a while seems to offer a nice distraction it soon becomes a chore to pick it up at all. With little story incentive and no hope for variety you probably wont make it past the halfway mark.
Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Aspyr | Aspire,Action Adventure | Linear,Switch Player,60,Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast has the makings of a great Star Wars game inside it but an incredibly frustrating front-end makes getting to the enjoyable meat a chore and will likely turn off most modern players.
Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters: Daybreak Special Gigs,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Arc System Works | Now Production,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Eurogamer Italy,60,Welcomed on PS4 for players who missed the original but this new version is not so special for those who have already played the game on PS3 and PS Vita.
Master of Orion 3,PC,Feb-25-2003,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | 4X,All Game Guide,50,In spite of Master of Orion 3s countless detail-oriented improvements connoisseurs of the series may also find themselves pining for the personality of the earlier games wishing to trade some of the new intricacy and erudition for a better sense of interaction and consequence.
Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts,Xbox 360,May-17-2011,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,SpazioGames,58,There are good ideas in this DLC. A real shame for the bugs and the overall lack of content.
Cargo! The Quest for Gravity,PC,Apr-21-2011,Ice-Pick Lodge,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,55,Cargo: The Quest for Gravity pulls you in with its surreal visuals and strange premise but its gameplay rarely gets off the ground.
theHunter: Call of the Wild,PC,Feb-16-2017,Expansive Worlds,Sports | Individual | Nature | Hunting,PC Gamer,60,Boasts some beautiful convincing countryside to hunt in but the glacial pace will challenge the limits of most people’s patience.
StarDrone,PlayStation 3,Apr-5-2011,Beatshapers,Action | General | General,GameSpot,60,Stardrones vibrant physics-driven arcade action suffers from difficulty spikes and frustrating design elements.
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2004,Interplay,Role-Playing | Action RPG,eToychest,60,This game just sullies the name of Fallout and cheapens it.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,PlayStation 2,Dec-8-2003,Paradigm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Maxim Online,60,While the tough stealthy game play won’t grip you in a chokehold of novelty and surprise it flashes a lethal look and feel.
Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm,PC,Sep-26-2002,3DO,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General,GameSpy,58,A disappointing expansion for Heroes IV. The few new items available couldve easily been available for free while the biggest change to the game - multiplayer -- is already free.
ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,Is this what real snowboarding is like? Because if it is I dont want any part of it. [Feb 2002 p.106]
Silent Scope 2: Dark Silhouette,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2001,KCET,Action | Shooter | Rail,GameSpot,55,While the gameplay and graphics are just about identical to those of the arcade version the lack of that big gimmicky sniper rifle makes the game downright silly.
Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff,PlayStation 2,Apr-18-2001,New World Computing,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG,GameSpot,52,Has a few surprises and some significant flaws. While die-hard strategy fans and extreme fans of the Heroes series on the PC might get a kick out of this one its really a rental at best.
Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business,PC,Nov-30-2000,Sir-Tech Software Inc.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | Tactics,Gamezilla!,64,Combined with repetitive gameplay where you march fight march fight rearm again and again this game can get pretty boring at times.
Assassin's Creed Liberation HD,PlayStation 3,Jan-14-2014,Ubisoft Sofia,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Digital Spy,60,Assassins Creed: Liberation HD offers a number of improvements over the Vita original some of which enhance the experience by facilitating smoother gameplay yet many of the titles weaknesses are amplified on the larger screen.
UEFA Euro 2012,PC,Apr-24-2012,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,Absolute Games,48,For an official game UEFA Euro 2012 is chock-full of unlicensed teams. Its easy to swallow false strips and fake player names in a team from lets say Lichtenstein but when the tournaments host nations Poland and Ukraine get the same treatment its just bad.
We Cheer 2,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Machatin | Inc.,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,GamePro,50,Its like playing Simon Says with a Simon that never attempts to fool you and is really into teeny-bop pop; if the graphics were a person her ugliness would prevent her from making the squad; controls arent precise enough.
Murder in the Abbey,PC,Aug-26-2008,Alcachofa Soft,Adventure | General | General,GameStar,58,At the beginning it looks like investigating secretly rummaging the abbey and questioning other characters could be fun but the game turns out to be made of pointless little riddles and requires searching through the same locations over and over again. Why somebody did something doesnt seem to matter at all. The Abbey is not about playing through a story its about forcing the player to solve riddles. At least the music by Emilio de Paz is well done.
Wild ARMs XF,PSP,Mar-11-2008,Media Vision,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,IGN,58,The gameplay just has too many holes to be enjoyable. The objective-based battles arent particularly well designed and character class implementation takes away a lot of player freedom.
The Sinking City,PlayStation 4,Jun-25-2019,Frogwares,Action Adventure | Survival,Gamers Heroes,60,Those invested in the Cthulhu mythos might be interested in the tale found in The Sinking City but most others should wait until the game is patched.
Corruption 2029,PC,Feb-17-2020,The Bearded Ladies Consulting,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Riot Pixels,56,Corruption 2029 is a shameless clone of Mutant Year Zero minus everything that was good in the original game.
Urban Trial Freestyle,3DS,Jun-27-2013,Strangelands Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Driving | Racing | General | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gamers\' Temple,64,Not too bad while it lasts but it doesnt last long.
The Legend of Korra,PC,Oct-21-2014,PlatinumGames,Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),60,The Legend of Korra Game is a unfortunate game. Game has a big potential but we have to play a unfinished game. It’s a fun but buggy game. You will find Legend of Korra both pain and pleasure.
Pressure,PC,Mar-26-2013,Chasing Carrots,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Riot Pixels,60,The best way to describe Pressure is bland. Aside from three entertaining boss encounters it is monotonous and charmless.
Dragon Age II: Legacy,Xbox 360,Jul-26-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Action RPG,Game Revolution,58,Unless youre a completionist I see little need to spend your precious sovereign on this one.
MXGP Pro,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Cubed3,60,While MXGP Pro is mostly an attractive enjoyable experience that represents the sport quite well even avid fans should ponder long and hard over its longstanding flaws before indulging.
Chasing Aurora,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Broken Rules,Action | General | Flight | Flight,Eurogamer Portugal,60,Chasing Aurora has a striking presentation thats why we felt a disappointment when discovered the lack of game modes. An opportunity to create a great game was missed.
Deadcore,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2017,Grip Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PlayStation Country,60,Deadcore is a game built for speed runners but people lusting after the fastest times will likely be hampered by the controls on the PlayStation 4. It is also a very hard game to learn and get good at this imposing difficulty will likely put many people off. However for £6.49 this is priced well and will offer some diversion just don’t expect to be playing this for months to come.
Sonic Heroes,PlayStation 2,Jan-27-2004,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Inside Gamer Online,60,Its also the closest the series has been to its roots in well over a decade.
Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness,GameCube,Sep-11-2002,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,TotalGames.net,53,All Kemco appears to have done is taken Tetris and turned it upside down. Oh and added a load of ‘cute’ egg characters too to brighten the whole thing up. Great.
Triple Play 2002,Xbox,Mar-18-2002,Pandemic Studios,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Sim,Electronic Gaming Monthly,47,This game cant even show a bunt without a glitchy flaw or two. [May 2002 p.114]
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PlayStation,Nov-15-2001,Argonaut Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameShark,58,Next-gen games notwithstanding HPs graphics are well below average. The textures are of the absolutely flat glued-to-the-wall variety theres tons of pixilation and everything is generally ugly.
Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open,Xbox,Nov-14-2001,Rockstar San Diego,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,TotalGames.net,55,A fast and fun arcade racer.
4x4 Evolution,PlayStation 2,Feb-26-2001,Terminal Reality,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,IGN,50,Not my cup of tea. But even if 4x4 Evo were my bag the gameplay itself is just not fun. The driving itself is slow jerky simplistic and mundane. Its dull. If it werent for the spectacularly lengthy career mode with its oogles of parts then the game would have received an even lower score.
Gunbird 2,Dreamcast,Nov-17-2000,Psikyo,Action | General,CNET Gamecenter,60,Because Gunbird 2 is such an insanely hard game casual gaming fans are warned to stay away. Only hard-core fans of the genre need apply.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD Ver.,PlayStation 3,Aug-21-2012,Capcom,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Destructoid,55,At $20 there are way better fighting games with way more polish for less money making JoJos Bizarre Adventure HD an incredibly hard sell. Given the rough edges it feels more as if Capcom is trying to play off of the hype from the upcoming new JoJos game which is currently in development rather than give a nod to a classic.
Sid Meier's Pirates!,Wii,Sep-28-2010,Virtuos,Strategy | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,60,Pirates! is a light-hearted diversion. Its a game that you can invest time in casually without any real concern for forgetting what you were doing or losing your place. However the Wii port added control issues to a game that has a need for tight controls therefore its hard to recommend Pirates! for Wii.
SimCity,PC,Mar-5-2013,Maxis,Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,Worth Playing,55,Theres just something disturbing in seeing a game that is part of such a storied and influential franchise sacrifice so much to rush headlong into the social sphere. Perhaps the bugs and shortcomings will be resolved in a few weeks but until then SimCitys hidden requirement of additional patience still applies.
Gods Will Be Watching,PC,Jul-24-2014,Devolver Digital,Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,games(TM),50,The goalposts are moved without warning. [Sept 2014 p.127]
Planet of the Eyes,Xbox One,Sep-12-2017,Coco Cucumber | Cococucumber,Action | Platformer | 2D,Generación Xbox,60,Planet of the Eyes is the typical game that points out good manners but then lets itself be dragged by the ballast of (in this particular case) a ridiculous duration. His resemblance to other classic platform games doesnt give him a special charisma either although fans of the genre will forgive him.
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,PC,Oct-3-2012,Arkedo Studio,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gameplanet,60,More attention to actual gameplay would have elevated Hell Yeah! beyond a mere distraction and as such its difficult to see it as a break-out success and even harder to recommend to platform fanatics looking for something new.
Of Orcs and Men,Xbox 360,Oct-24-2012,Cyanide | Spiders,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG | Western-Style,AusGamers,56,Combine the linear environments combat mechanics and cut-scenes and it feels more like watching an animated show or even reading a book about it all. If you can get past all this and even find the right stride with the combat mechanics it does make for an interesting storyline and the game gradually expands slightly.
The Lord of the Rings: Tactics,PSP,Nov-8-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,GameSpy,60,A disappointing package that seems to have received even less development time than most of the PSP launch titles.
Musashi: Samurai Legend,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG,TotalPlayStation,55,Fancy graphics cant distract from the fact that this is a rather boring repetive game after a few hours. A shoddy framerate and unbalanced sound dont help matters either.
SpongeBob Squigglepants 3D,3DS,May-17-2011,WayForward,Miscellaneous | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,59,Spongebob doesnt have the personality to pull it all together. [Oct 2011 p.71]
Restaurant Empire II,PC,May-26-2009,Enlight Software,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Vandal,65,Despite some flaws and the fact it gets repetitive after a while the game manages to bring some freshness to the management strategy game genre.
Disney*Pixar WALL-E,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Heavy Iron Studios | Savage Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Game Chronicles,48,Too bad a game this boring and frustrating ever saw the light of day.
Hardwood Hearts,Xbox 360,Dec-8-2005,Silver Creek Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Board / Card Game | Gambling,Talk Xbox,59,Plain visuals repetitive audio and straightforward gameplay make up this title’s feature list. Hearts fans will of course enjoy playing online but most can be content with the Hearts game included with Windows XP saving their 400 MS Points for something else.
SIMULACRA,Switch,Dec-3-2019,Kaigan Games OU,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,FNintendo,60,SIMULACRA does not play like the greatest work ever made but that doesnt mean theres nothing to draw from this mystery FMV adventure. While the gameplay feels rather shallow the plot is compelling enough to keep the players entertained and involved with the hints and twists that are found along the way and the feeling of satisfaction when coming across a clue or reaching a different ending do help SIMULACRA to have some merit of its own.
Snooker 19,PlayStation 4,Apr-16-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,A PlayStation comeback that’s welcome yet undercooked almost as though it was released three months too early. Keep track of patches and rejudge in August. [Issue#163 p.87]
The Council - Episode 5: Checkmate,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,60,The daemonic theme took over far too much of the story’s focus. When coupled with technical issues it has reinforced that The Council has lost potential written all over it. Despite the many negatives there are positives to take away from the experience. Gameplay is engaging from start to finish with its RPG mechanics reinventing an episodic experience. Big Bad’s multiple endings offer plenty of reason to revisit not only Checkmate but also the first four episodes and see the different outcome from making a major choice. Once the finale is all done and dusted either the player or Big Bad will utter one simple word depending on the final outcome of the story. That word is none other than checkmate.
Grand Ages: Medieval,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2015,Gaming Minds Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General,games(TM),60,A fine option for those on PS4 craving more strategy. [Issue#167 p.93]
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,VideoGamer,60,WRC 2 is a minor improvement on last years game but that isnt good enough. Other than the official WRC license all the game has going for it is a decent (but not brilliant) driving model. Everything else here feels dated and pales in comparison to numerous other games in the genre.
Alien Breed 3: Descent,PC,Nov-17-2010,Team17,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC PowerPlay,60,Better options available but not a write-off. [Feb 2011 p.67]
Kholat,PC,Jun-9-2015,IMGN.PRO,Fantasy | Adventure | 3D | First-Person,games(TM),50,Visually stunning but a slog to play through. [Issue#164 p.90]
Sid Meier's Starships,PC,Mar-12-2015,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Game Over Online,55,There are lots of things Starships does poorly but at least as far as I’m concerned the lack of meaningful tech tree and shallow starship construction really don’t suffice in a game that after all has Starships in the title.
Infliction: Extended Cut,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2020,Caustic Reality,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,COGconnected,60,What sort of horror game puts you to sleep? One that doesn’t try anything new. And that’s what Infliction is. I can’t stress enough that it isn’t the technical side of the game that I don’t like – I think a lot of what’s there is well done with the budget they had. The lighting is good some of (not all) the voice acting is strong and the sound design is solid. But it’s the lack of innovation in storytelling and mechanics that throw me off. It’s frustrating too because ideas like the Polaroid camera and Cooking With Masimo show me that this team is capable of coming up with some genuinely fun stuff. But until then I guess we’ll just be afflicted by Infliction.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,PC,Jun-30-2009,EA Bright Light,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Absolute Games,60,Get ready to fly on brooms mix reagents in a pot and swing the magic wand… Until you yawn.
Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species,PC,Oct-19-2005,Blue Fang Games,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Computer and Video Games,65,If you enjoy squandering time away on the original title youre bound to find more joy and excitement from the additional animals and buildings included in this expansion.
Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight,PlayStation 4,Jul-7-2017,Artdink,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Eurogamer Italy,60,Accel World VS Sword Art Online is a good title for fans of the virtual worlds created by Reki Kawahara. However the game does not improve on the previous SAO games and the narrative fusion of the two universes feels sometimes forced.
Star Soldier R,Wii,May-19-2008,Hudson Soft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Nintendo Gamer,53,Very poor value for money. [JPN Import; June 2008 p.68]
Yosumin! LIVE,Xbox 360,May-27-2009,Square Enix,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Destructoid,60,Its a very casual puzzle-like game that can slowly sneak up on you with a hidden complexity. It will not be fun for all players and even fans of the puzzle genre may be left scratching their heads.
SingStar ABBA,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2008,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,TotalPlayStation,60,Clearly directed at one specific audience SingStar ABBA if nothing else will satisfy hardcore fans of the series. Everyone else? Eh not so much.
Call of Duty: Roads to Victory,PSP,Mar-13-2007,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PALGN,60,A valiant effort for what it is but still falls short in terms of control and level design. But if you absolutely must have your World War II fix on the go you could do worse.
Wheelman,Xbox 360,Mar-24-2009,Tigon | Midway Studios - Newcastle,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Level7.nu,60,If you mix together gameplay elements from Driver Grand Theft Auto Burnout and then throw some Vin Diesel in there the result is The Wheelman. An action filled experience where driving cars actually offers an entertaining experience during the somewhat repetitive missions. There is a total lack of storytelling in the game and the sequences on foot are quite mediocre but if you can look past this youll be treated to a decent action experience.
Wavey The Rocket,PC,May-7-2020,UpperRoom Games Ltd,Action | General,Eurogamer Italy,60,Wavey The Rocket is a new 3D side-scrolling arcade game based on a little fast rocket riding on a side curve. Despite its original gameplay this game is not suitable for all players.
Danger Zone,PlayStation 4,May-30-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,GameSpew,50,If you are craving that Burnout action but can’t be arsed to pull out an old console then sure Danger Zone will at least remind you of those glory days. Unfortunately it’ll do little else.
Redeemer,PC,Aug-1-2017,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,GameSpew,60,Initially I was really taken with Redeemer. The violent action slick controls and impressive visuals made a great first impression. After three hours of play however it became a slog to work through.
STRAFE,PC,May-9-2017,Pixel Titans,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PCGamesN,60,The sad reality is Strafe exasperates as much as it exhilarates. For every fleet footed show of sharp shooting it conspires to blast itself in the food with devious tactics and a steady slew of quite ‘fuuuuu!’ moments to players brave enough to endure the onslaught. There’s a really solid often graceful FPS in here one beefed up with generous side content – the 10 room horde mode-esque Murderzone and online speedruns break up the crushing campaign. Yet ultimately you can’t quite outflank Strafe’s unfair overwhelming slaughter.
Townsmen: A Kingdom Rebuilt,Switch,Nov-9-2018,HandyGames,Strategy | General | Management | Government,Digitally Downloaded,50,Over and over again some truly baffling decisions let it down and while the scenarios justify the asking price in themselves for any of us that prefer the sandbox mode of the simulations that we play Townsmen is a complete misfire.
The Town of Light,PC,Feb-26-2016,LKA,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Everyeye.it,60,Despite the very quick playthrough (around 3 hrs) he plot looses momentum halfway through and the pace slows down the progression. The idea is sound but the execution deserved more care.
X-Men: The Arcade Game,PlayStation 3,Dec-14-2010,Konami,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Play UK,60,Expensive but worth it for nostalgic thrills. [Issue#203 p.98]
Van Helsing,PlayStation 2,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,AceGamez,60,A second rate clone of Devil May Cry and if youre looking for that youd be better off with Devil May Cry 2.
Mace Griffin Bounty Hunter,Xbox,Jun-20-2003,Warthog,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Electronic Gaming Monthly,52,Its tough to overlook its frequent pauses for loading brain-dead enemies unrealistic animations and repetitive graphics. [Aug 2003 p.122]
Global Touring Challenge: Africa,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2002,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,GamePro,60,Although each car handles differently the off-road speedsters are extremely loose which makes for perfecting turns a frustrating task.
WWE WrestleMania X8,GameCube,Jun-9-2002,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Total Video Games,50,This game is rushed and it truly shows in every aspect. I feel as if I’ve been taken back to the days of WCW Nitro and the likes. Please get me out of this Nightmare.
Forever Kingdom,PlayStation 2,Jan-21-2002,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PSM Magazine,60,Just doesnt quite provide enough bang for your buck. [Iss #54 Jan 2002]
Floigan Bros. Episode 1,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2001,Visual Concepts,Action | General,GameSpot,52,There are hints of inspiration throughout with the game sporting some good-looking visuals a catchy soundtrack and a distinct sense of style. But the games length uneven gameplay and atrocious camera negate these virtues.
Gradius III and IV,PlayStation 2,Nov-13-2000,KCET,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,CNET Gamecenter,60,The good news if youre a hard-core old-school gamer is that they both play like the Gradius shooters of old. The bad news for every other gamer out there is that Gradius III and IV dont showcase the true power of the PS2.
We Happy Few,Xbox One,Aug-10-2018,Compulsion Games,Action Adventure | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Theres a general technical ropiness. [Nov 2018 p.80]
Micro Machines V4,PlayStation 2,Jun-27-2006,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Arcade,VideoGamer,50,As a harmless game for kids to play together Micro Machines V4 serves its purpose but a bit of flair and a larger scope could have made it the ultimate party racing game.
Legend of Kay Anniversary,PC,Jul-27-2015,Neon Studios | Kaiko,Action Adventure | General | Linear,Multiplayer.it,60,Legend of Kay Anniversary is a decent remaster of a not-so-brilliant action adventure game.
Major League Baseball 2K9,Xbox 360,Mar-3-2009,2K Sports,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,AceGamez,60,Major League Baseball 2K9 isnt a terrible game but it isnt a good one.
Party Hard,PC,Aug-25-2015,Pinokl Games,Action | General,Destructoid,60,Despite owing a lot to Hotline Miami in terms of sight and sound Party Hard is almost the antithesis of its most obvious influence. On a personal note its actually more reminiscent of How to be a Complete Bastard a similar (and ancient) game involving house parties and a destructive protagonist.
BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II,3DS,May-31-2011,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,XGN,60,This game has its own style and it has got a lot of options. But the truth is that there are better fighting games for sale for the 3DS.
Disgaea Infinite,PSP,Jun-8-2010,Nippon Ichi Software,Adventure | General | General | Visual Novel,Cheat Code Central,60,Although each playthrough will only take an hour or so if you want to experience all of the different paths as well as the games 13 endings you will need a good six hours or so. Just be prepared for a lot of repetition.
RiME,Switch,Nov-14-2017,Tantalus | Tequila Works,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,GamePro Germany,59,Quotation forthcoming.
Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix,Switch,Nov-8-2018,RideonJapan |Inc.,Action | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,FNintendo,50,Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix falls into an ungrateful position. While there is nothing particularly bad about this game it never manages to go so far as to stand out amidst its peers. Despite its good-looking artwork this is a mostly generic effort when it comes to plot and dialogues and with a gameplay that has too many clichés and which does not add an in-depth dimension to the experience.
Batman: The Telltale Series,PC,Aug-2-2016,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Game Over Online,56,About the only nice thing I can say about Batman is that it’s short. It only took me about eight hours to complete the game’s five episodes and I was happy when it was over. So obviously I don’t recommend this game to anyone for any reason unless you’re an obstinate fan of the Dark Knight.
Alien Breed,PlayStation Vita,Feb-12-2013,Team17,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Games Master UK,52,The ability to switch between classic and HD visuals is a brief curiosity but nothing more. [May 2013 p.81]
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight,PC,Mar-16-2010,EA LA,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpy,50,Straight fights in C&C4 play a lot like a boxing match between two guys with iron jaws and teensy weensy hands. You and your opponent can pound away at each other till youre both spent like an addicts last dollar but nobodys knocking anybody out.
The Saga of Ryzom,PC,Sep-20-2004,Nevrax,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Computer Gaming World,60,The only thing missing from Ryzoms customizable battling harvesting and crafting systems is a lack of bothersome bugs. [Jan 2005 p.102]
Mad Riders,Xbox 360,May-30-2012,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,ZTGD,60,Mad Riders is not a bad game just an unfortunate one. Naild is now in the bargain bin along with some of the older MX vs. ATV games and they are much better. This feels like a stripped down version of Naild and one that is not nearly as entertaining. The lack of diversity and progression are disappointing and the stiff controls dont lend themselves well to this type of game. If you want an off-road racer for your console there are a lot of other better choices out there.
Need for Speed Undercover,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2008,EA Vancouver,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Thunderbolt,60,A disappointing title. It doesn’t build on the series in any way basically sticking to Most Wanted’s fundamentals whilst adding more technical issues.
Warframe,PlayStation 4,Nov-12-2013,Digital Extremes,General | General | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gameblog.fr,60,Warframe is a good free-to-play TPS but the action is too repetitive to make it an essential.
Ghostbusters: The Video Game,PlayStation 2,Jun-16-2009,War Drum Studios,Action | General,Gameplayer Sweden,50,There is really no argument in favor of Ghostbusters on the Playstation 2. The story follows that of its more talented brothers (Xbox 360 and Playstation 3) and the content offers no major news.
Phantasy Star Universe,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2006,Sonic Team,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Jolt Online Gaming UK,60,The single-player is a fun new addition but is plagued by frustrating design choices and idiotic AI while the multiplayer is very hard to justify paying £6.99 a month for especially as the game doesnt even come with a free trial period.
Armored Core: For Answer,Xbox 360,Sep-16-2008,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,TeamXbox,61,The cut scenes are gorgeous the mech design is cool the overall art style is kind of awesome… but the game itself isn’t really worth it.
The friends of Ringo Ishikawa,Switch,Apr-3-2019,yeo,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gameblog.fr,50,The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa is quite weak in its pure playful proposal but has a real personality that could well embark you if you are sensitive to this typical Japanese atmosphere carried by hip hop melodies and retro graphics successful in this small city free to live the existence often in slow motion of a rascal high school and his friends. In this again the fact of being able to play in a nomadic way with the Switch is a plus.
Seasons After Fall,PlayStation 4,May-16-2017,Swing Swing Submarine,Action | Platformer | 2D,DarkStation,60,Seasons After Fall has its share of issues but it has enough going for it that there is an audience out there that will gain some enjoyment from it. The games production values are top notch so if you can look past the games problematic level design and simplistic gameplay then you may find it to be a very serene and immersive experience. It is a shame that those issues exist though because the games mechanics show some terrific potential. There are scattered moments when all of the games elements -- its atmosphere its gameplay and its graphics -- come together to provide some memorable experiences. In the end though the story in Seasons After Fall is too vague and confusing to be satisfying and a games graphics and music can only carry it so far. There is more than enough art in this package but there is not enough game.
The Baconing,Xbox 360,Aug-31-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Action RPG | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Thunderbolt,60,The Baconings witty daft and fun but also doesnt do enough to improve on the faults of the previous entries in the series and in some cases pushes those issues to the forefront. The bacon is now well cooked and about to burn.
Vikings: Wolves of Midgard,Xbox One,Mar-28-2017,Games Farm,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameSpew,50,If you’ve worn out your Diablo disc Vikings: Wolves of Midgard may fill a tiny bit of the void but mostly its painful similarities yet numerous missteps will likely just frustrate you.
NASCAR: The Game 2013,PC,Jul-24-2013,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,Gamereactor Sweden,40,Despite a lot of content Nascar: The Game 2013 is lacking in almost every gameplay aspect. Please let someone more talented do the Nascar series in the future.
N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure,Xbox One,May-15-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Miscellaneous | Adventure | Puzzle | General | 3D | First-Person,Pure Xbox,50,Your mileage may vary depending on how much the story grabs you but most will find that the asking price here is too high for what you get.
Sea of Solitude,PC,Jul-5-2019,Electronic Arts | Jo-Mei Games,General | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,CGMagazine,55,A clearly personal story told in a bland repetitive 3D platformer with padded gameplay terrible voice acting and no subtlety.
Kholat,PlayStation 4,Mar-8-2016,IMGN.PRO,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Everyeye.it,62,Its partly a walking simulator but the gameplay delivers some unexpected turns. The young development team clearly lacks experience but its still a promising first step.
The Crew,Xbox One,Dec-2-2014,Ubisoft Reflections | Ivory Tower,GT / Street | Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | Automobile,Eurogamer Germany,60,A lot of The Crew seems hardly thought-out almost chaotic but there is still a lot of good hidden underneath these problems.
Tiger Woods PGA Tour,DS,Dec-14-2004,Sensory Sweep,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Sim | Sim,IGN,60,The attempt to offer a unique touch-screen swing mechanic is definitely respectable but the first-time solution doesnt work nearly as well or offer as much control as it could have.
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,The Sydney Morning Herald,60,Aussie expertise has produced the best Spyro game in many years but the action gets repetitive and some old fans might be dismayed by the emphasis on combat.
Academy of Champions: Soccer,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,Nintendo Life,60,If you’re really after a quick knockabout and want to take up your only chance to play as Altair and Jade on Wii you’ll find some enjoyment in Academy of Champions but be prepared for plenty of frustration mixed in with your pie and Bovril.
Moons of Madness,Xbox One,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,ZTGD,55,In the end I think Moons of Madness is an ok game that could have used a little more fine tuning with both the story and the horror/survival mechanics. I would never say this is a bad game by any means but it is most certainly a forgettable one. I feel like I have seen something like this before in multiple other games and remember them much more than I did this one. At the same time if you’re looking for a horror game that has some interesting mechanics at times and some decent atmosphere I would at least wait for a price drop but would consider this if you haven’t tried it.
Sleep Tight,Switch,Jul-26-2018,We Are Fuzzy,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameSpew,50,While it certainly has its moments as an engaging shooter Sleep Tight might be better being slept through.
Disney/Pixar Ratatouille,PSP,Jun-26-2007,Locomotive Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GamesRadar+,60,Essentially the game is an underwhelming experience that unlike the film is ultimately forgettable.
Batman Begins,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2005,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Pelit (Finland),60,Could anyone take less risks designing a license action-adventure? Nice graphics and sound but super simplistic gameplay. Also super boring. [Sept. 05]
Carve,Xbox,Feb-24-2004,Argonaut Games,Driving | Racing | Snow / Water,Play Magazine,58,Carves saving grace is its online multiplayer handset-compatible team-based play. [May 2004 p.56]
Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction,Xbox,Jul-30-2003,Zono Inc.,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi,GMR Magazine,60,Uninspired level design rounds out the package with the designers relying far too much on impassable mountain ranges and forcing players to find roundabout routes to their targets. [Sept 2003 p.77]
X-Squad,PlayStation 2,Oct-23-2000,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,All Game Guide,50,As it stands it is an average action game that is bettered by a number of original PlayStation titles which is unacceptable.
Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault,PlayStation 3,Nov-27-2012,Insomniac Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Digital Spy,60,Enjoyable multiplayer modes are only worth so much when backed by a paltry single player campaign but taking the budget price tag into account we can think of worse Christmas stocking-fillers for fans of the series of the tower defense genre.
Yakuza: Dead Souls,PlayStation 3,Mar-13-2012,Ryu ga Gotoku Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Vandal,60,An interesting turn in the series but its gameplay is terribly designed in some parts and it lacks ambition and originality as a zombie game. We will pass a lot of time shooting and killing without no additional motivation or extra repeating the same scheme constantly. Only for hardcore fans of the Yakuza series.
ADR1FT,PC,Mar-28-2016,Three One Zero,Action | Action Adventure | General | Survival,CD-Action,55,The visuals are fantastic but I was disappointed with the shallow boring story and I grew annoyed with the gameplay. What upset me the most was the lack of scientific credibility in a game about scientists on a scientific space station (e.g. why do station modules separated by an explosion suddenly stop drifting apart!?). [06/2016 p.60]
Chaos Wars,PlayStation 2,May-30-2008,Idea Factory,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Hardcore Gamer,55,The grid-less combat can be annoying to get used to—especially when learning how to properly position characters—but there’s enough small changes to put a good spin on otherwise stale tactical combat.
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III,PC,May-22-2015,NeocoreGames,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Game Revolution,60,Anyone who follows this series will still be entertained with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III but theyll ultimately be disappointed by the overly steamlined nature of this installment.
Super Lucky's Tale,Xbox One,Nov-7-2017,Playful Corp.,2D | Action | Platformer | 3D,3DJuegos,60,There is some magic in its world but Super Lucky’s Tale has some serious gameplay and camera problems.
Cold War,PC,Sep-27-2005,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Worth Playing,62,Unfortunately as imaginative as the X-ray camera and creative gadgets are they simply cannot make up for Cold Wars countless missteps
Snooker 19,Switch,Aug-23-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Switch Player,50,Snooker 19 is a decent snooker game but a poor entry into any other category. Dated graphics and finicky controls make this hard to recommend.
Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs. Sasuke,DS,Nov-12-2010,Takara Tomy,Action | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gameblog.fr,60,As an action platformer Naruto VS Sasuke is a fair and nice game to play. Its greatest flaw is the amount of similar titles on the DS to which it doesnt offer anything new. If youre an unconditional fan youll still find a well crafted game but if youre used to playing Naruto games on the DS this may be a waste of time and money.
Officers,PC,Jul-14-2009,3A Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,PC Zone UK,60,Officially generic. [Oct 2009 p.70]
Zombie Driver HD,Xbox 360,Oct-17-2012,EXOR Studios,Action | General | General,Thunderbolt,60,The problem is that the single-player package stretches the pretty basic gameplay worryingly thin and leaderboard competition can only keep you interested for so long. If youre looking for a decent arcade romp you could do a lot worse than pick up Zombie Driver HD. Its just that you could do a lot better too.
Crash Twinsanity,PlayStation 2,Sep-28-2004,Traveller's Tales,Action | Platformer | 3D,Game Revolution,58,A decent game and offers a few neat tweaks to its classic formula but in general does very little to break the mold of its predecessors.
MX vs. ATV All Out: Anniversary Edition,Xbox One,Feb-26-2019,THQ Nordic,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,ZTGD,55,When it’s all said and done MX Vs. ATV: All Out is an ok racing game. There’s a few issues here and there with the physics that could get to me and the fact that if I crashed it pretty much meant a last place finish for me but I can commend the game for improving from their previous outing with Supercross. I pretty much disliked that game while this one has some tweaks to the controls and enough content to keep me trying it out. Obviously only motocross fans should apply here and with the cheaper price the extra DLC players can find some enjoyment here.
Darksiders III,PlayStation 4,Nov-27-2018,Gunfire Games | THQ Nordic,Action Adventure | Open-World,Critical Hit,60,Beneath the mountain of bugs shoddy design and inconsistent performance there’s a genuinely good adventure waiting to be experienced in Darksiders III. Unfortunately its numerous problems are more than just annoying in nature. They’re quite simply…apocalyptic.
RymdResa,PC,Aug-20-2015,Morgondag,Role-Playing | General,Twinfinite,60,It’s pretty minimal in its design difficult to get into and a bit cumbersome to navigate. I’ll freely admit that on my first few plays I planned on giving it a pretty low score. As I played a bit more though it began to grow on me and the frustration faded as I learned pilot manage resources and make use of upgrades and consumables.
Hydrophobia: Prophecy,PC,May-9-2011,Dark Energy Digital,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameStar,56,The game lacks diversity. In each of the similar looking rooms youre doing the same thing. The less well done shooter elements and climbing passages cant change that.
Intellivision Lives!,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2003,Realtime Associates,Miscellaneous | Compilation,GameSpy,60,Wisely priced at 20 bucks and its historical info alone makes it a must for anyone with an interest in video-game lore but not one of the included games is anything more than a mild curiosity.
Worms: Open Warfare,DS,Mar-22-2006,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Artillery,GameSpot,59,Clumsy controls rocky presentation and a dearth of gameplay options hinder Worms return to 2D on the DS.
Storm,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,EKO Software,Miscellaneous | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,60,Not the perfect mixture between Braid and Flower we were hoping for.
TNA iMPACT!,PlayStation 3,Sep-9-2008,Midway Studios - Los Angeles,Action | Sports | Fighting | Fighting | Individual | Wrestling | Combat | Wrestling,PlayStation Universe,60,A wasted opportunity in almost every conceivable manner.
RPG Maker Fes,3DS,Jun-27-2017,Jupiter Corporation | Kadokawa,Role-Playing | General,Gameblog.fr,60,Despite an inevitably cramped interface RPG Maker Fes is still a solid yet demanding game creation software all the more so without a proper - if not fun - tutorial. But neither portability nor simple online sharing system can make up for such restrictions concerning tools and content. These tend to limit or even format the end results. Considering the time they require and the DLC policy it would be wiser to invest in the massively more elaborate PC version.
nail'd,Xbox 360,Nov-30-2010,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GameShark,58,Naild works just fine as a mindless racing game with thin idiot-proof gameplay to tide you over when you dont feel like something substantial with a learning curve.
Killer Is Dead,PlayStation 3,Aug-27-2013,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PSX Extreme,54,Killer is Dead has a lot going for it. The foundation is there. But the positives are mired beneath a poor gameplay mechanic that makes even simple control a chore. The story isn’t allowed to shine due to simplistic writing and stereotypical characters the difficulty can be very erratic and too many deaths feel cheap and unfair.
Arc Rise Fantasia,Wii,Jul-27-2010,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,1UP,58,If youre one of those players who simply cant make do without a Tales-like RPG experience every few months Arc Rise Fantasia might have enough of what youre looking for. But for most players the game will simply be a flashback to the bad ol days of the mid-90s when shoestring localization budgets botched many an epic RPG adventure.
Exit DS,DS,Nov-5-2008,Moss,Action | Puzzle | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,60,Exit DS has some likeable aspects but the tedious control scheme keeps it from greatness.
Track Lab,PlayStation 4,Aug-21-2018,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,UploadVR,55,It’s certainly easy for basically anyone to craft a simple beat in Track Lab but someone looking for anything more advanced would be better spending their time in a program like GarageBand. For VR junkies the prospect of becoming a virtual DJ is certainly appealing but a game with pre-selected and popular song clips like Electronauts will be a lot more satisfying and a lot less time-consuming.
Rainbow Skies,PlayStation 4,Jun-26-2018,SideQuest Studios,Role-Playing | General,GameSpew,50,It certainly lacks the punch and awe of the more inspired RPGs of late and it shows the more you play.
King Oddball,Xbox One,Sep-9-2016,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Action,CGMagazine,55,King Oddball is a game that loses its luster really quickly. What could have been a surprisingly clever play on the Angry Birds formula ends up being a dull affair by its lack of variety weak level design or replayability.
Thor: God of Thunder,DS,May-3-2011,WayForward,Action | General | General,The A.V. Club,58,There are inspired moments here especially in the games boss fights-the final two involve multi-jointed sprites spanning both screens-but theyre few and far between.
Cranium Kabookii,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Cubed3,60,Cranium Kabookii is definitely a fun little product for Wii with lots of variety involved and clever puzzles. Sadly there are a few niggles that prevent this from being a must-buy especially given how the board game itself is a much cheaper alternative.
Star Trek: Tactical Assault,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,G4 TV,60,Despite issues with the feel of the ship controls and combat there’s enough depth and gameplay modes to make it worth a look. The game looks fantastic and with so many ships battles and options to play with there’s more good than bad here.
Avatar: The Last Airbender,DS,Oct-10-2006,TOSE,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamePro,60,The game is obviously aimed at children who will most likely eat this one up like it was sweet sweet candy. Adults however will find it about as appetizing as steamed cauliflower and should definitely avoid it as such.
Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue,GameCube,Aug-16-2005,Xpec,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Gaming Age,58,While the basic gameplay concepts are put to good use poor design muddies what potential there was. If youre a die-hard Sanrio fan though this is definitely worth a playthrough.
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,PC,Nov-10-2004,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Warcry,60,The console versions have more variety in level design more distinct roles for each of the children and a longer play time. Heck I could finish the PC version in less time than it would take to watch the movie.
Wrath Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Feb-10-2004,Double Helix Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Boomtown,50,While it may be a fun little jaunt with the appearance of a clever strategy/action game if you attempt to play it that way you soon find out that it is fundamentally broken. A lesson from history one hopes.
RoadKill,GameCube,Oct-30-2003,Terminal Reality,Driving | Car Combat,GameNow,50,This game does nothing new except offer a ton of foul language to get you in trouble with the rents. Next please.
Pro Rally,GameCube,Nov-11-2002,Ubisoft,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,IGN,64,With a focus on being more accessible and arcadey its pretty easy to jump into for beginners; however for rally experts it may proof too basic to be worth any interest.
Superman: Shadow of Apokolips,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2002,Atari,Action Adventure | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,59,Sadly Shadow Of Apokolips just isn’t adventurous enough and offers little new or fun to both the Superman fan and game fan alike. More games like this and he could find himself back in the grave.
Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates,Game Boy Advance,Apr-30-2002,RFX Interactive,Action | Platformer | 2D,All Game Guide,60,For young dinosaur enthusiasts it would be an appropriate choice as its based on a peaceful premise and contains no graphic content or gore.
Wild Wild Racing,PlayStation 2,Oct-25-2000,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,GameSpot,60,Lacks any real punch and stands as the quintessential middle-of-the-road off-roading game.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood,PlayStation 4,Jul-26-2019,MachineGames,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,VGC,60,New Colossus fans will probably dislike its unfocused narrative and fussy levelling system but Youngblood offers plenty of blood and thunder if you give it time.
Juiced,PC,Jun-13-2005,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Yahoo!,60,The simple truth is that Juiced is behind the curve. The racing isnt bad but the game places emphasis on the wrong reward system.
The Adventures of Tintin: The Game,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2011,Ubisoft Montpellier,Adventure | General | General,Digital Spy,60,Ubisoft Montreal has paid close attention to both the Tintin licence and its target market meaning the game actually just about works. The action is hugely linear and the level design basic yet the campaign is also engaging to play through mixing platforming combat and vehicle sections in a reasonably decent narrative.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,PC,Jun-25-2007,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer UK,51,Hacky port that bleongs on consoles. [Sept 2007 p.80]
Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2011,Vicious Cycle,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer.nl,50,Fair is fair Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon is a game of below average quality. But because it doesnt pretend to be anything more than that well let that slide. But even for a game in which simplism is the main attraction it still does too many things wrong. That makes EDF: Insect Armageddon entertaining for an hour or two (possibly longer in coöp) but the lack of any variation makes you want to put it down rather sooner than later.
Dead Island: Definitive Collection,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,Techland,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Push Square,60,Dead Island: Definitive Collection is by no means perfect but it still succeeds in providing you with a substantial slice of flawed but generally fine zombie slaying action. Despite offering a graphical upgrade though there may not be much here to lure in those who have played these titles before – especially seeing as no real changes have been made to the core gameplay and because newcomer Retro Revenge disappoints.
The Witch and the Hundred Knight: Revival Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,IGN Spain,55,An unnecessary remaster without proper new reasons to justify its existence.
198X,PC,Jun-20-2019,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,SpazioGames,64,The first episode of 198X is an homage to the best and most iconic arcade games of the 80s but tells a really trivial and generic story.
The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer,Xbox,Nov-1-2005,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamerFeed,60,The gameplay has its setbacks and doesnt really evolve but it still offers fun two-player beat-em-up action and has a better presentation than it deserves.
Suikoden IV,PlayStation 2,Jan-11-2005,KCET,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,eToychest,60,A disappointment on all ends. Failed potential seeps from every area and as the game drags on the realization that it doesnt get any better starts to sink in.
Supreme Ruler: Cold War,PC,Jul-19-2011,BattleGoat Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Multiplayer.it,60,Excellent simulation and storic research Cold War suffers some AI problem poor engine and inconsistent music and sound effects.
This Is the Police,PlayStation 4,Mar-22-2017,Weappy Studio,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life | Career,CGMagazine,60,This is the Police is simple but highly addictive if you have the time to dedicate becoming more invested in Jack Boyd and his personal chaotic life.
Neon Chrome,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gaming Age,50,In small doses it might work — which takes me back to that caveat above — but as a sit-down console experience Neon Chrome just feels a little lacking.
FIFA Street 2,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Games Radar,60,FIFA Street 2 just isnt much fun to play plain and simple. It wont gain many supporters from the soccer enthusiast set nor arcade sports fans. The multiplayer isnt even that great - shunning online completely.
Fallout 76: Wastelanders,PlayStation 4,Apr-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,IGN,60,The Wastelanders update at least solidifies Fallout 76 as something that’s worth recommending to series fans who are interested in multiplayer. The new storyline is great but not as easy to play with friends as it should be.
Super Bomberman R,Xbox One,Jun-12-2018,Konami,Puzzle | Action | Arcade,TheXboxHub,60,Super Bomberman R is just a bit of a non-starter. The lacklustre campaign is only good to hold your attention for so long and the modes that really matter are criminally held back by a low player count.
Cubemen 2,Wii U,Sep-4-2014,3 Sprockets,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | General | Defense,Eurogamer Portugal,50,Cubemen 2 is a game of strategy and action in real-time strong in content and with a satisfactory design. It has some flaws especially at the level of interaction and control of the camera. The better part of the game lies in the online experience if you manage to find other players to play with.
Necrovision,PC,May-18-2009,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Crazy as hell Necrovision brings a new perspective to the events of World War One. Strictly a linear action shooter excels with an unconventional set of weapons and frantic boss fights. Unfortunately the graphics dont match the extreme HW requirements. [Feb 2009]
Worms Forts: Under Siege,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,60,Any improvements to the fun factor given to a multiplayer game is mostly down to all humans suffering from the same level of confusion given by a game that could do with being more like worms and less like a squeaking game of Crossbows & Catapults. More annoying than fun and not funny.
Dirty Bomb,PC,Jun-1-2015,Splash Damage,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PC Invasion,50,Acceptable but could have been so much better. Dirty Bomb is hampered by free-to-play nagging small maps and too many uninspiring matches.
World Poker Tour,Xbox,Oct-18-2005,2K Sports,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,GamerFeed,60,Something couldve been done to spice up the presentation and the AI couldve used tightening to the point that it could barely breathe.
Moons of Madness,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,GamePro Germany,63,Quotation forthcoming.
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,LucasArts,Action | General | General,XGN,55,Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II unfortunately did not become what many people hoped. The graphics are beautiful but in almost all other areas the game fails to impress.
Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom,Xbox One,Apr-28-2017,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object,DarkStation,60,The visuals are bright and despite their overly rich nature the screens are easy to read. The character graphics can be awkward though and the voice acting is sadly pretty ho-hum with only a few voice actors doing a bit too many characters for their skill range. Nevertheless the numerous cut scenes enrich the experience. In the end Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom is not quite like your typical Artifex Mundi game for better or worse. While the story is intriguing and mostly succeeds in its ambiguity the game itself is a tad too simple.
Resident Evil 6,Xbox One,Mar-29-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,4Players.de,59,Of course it looks better than on the old gen consoles a few years back. But the conceptual and mechanical shortcomings are still evident. This serves as a warning in which direction Capcom shouldn’t go with the sequel.
Godzilla: Save the Earth,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Fighting | 3D,Game Informer,60,A monstrous letdown. [Dec 2004 p.165]
FIFA Street 3,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,59,This game may not appeal to a big percentage of soccer fans. Nevertheless it does provide a few good laughs albeit short-lived. It’s not a game I can see myself playing consistently.
Finding Nemo,Xbox,May-9-2003,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GMR Magazine,60,The visuals arent as impressive as the movies but the underwater aesthetic and various effects (currents bubbles steam) are pleasing to the eye. [Sept 2003 p.77]
InnerSpace,Switch,Jan-16-2018,PolyKnight Games,Simulation | Flight | Civilian,Digitally Downloaded,60,Despite moments of brilliance and an overall lovely aesthetic there are mechanics which seem to be at odds with each other and thus the game seems conflicted. One moment you’re slowly following an enormous glowing beast through an oceanic tunnel and the next you’re chaining drifts together to zip through tight caverns while breaking through cracked glass panes.
Dragon's Prophet,PC,Aug-13-2013,Runewaker Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy,MMORPG.com,53,I had such high hopes for Dragon’s Prophet. Everything about it sounds like so much fun on paper. But what we have is a clear case of a game that needs a lot more time in development before it should be taking money from anyone. This shouldn’t be an open beta and you shouldn’t be able to spend money in Auretia. I understand that SOE and Runewaker need to pay the bills but both parties would have been far better off letting the game take a little more time in closed beta to take in and react to feedback from its community. Dragon’s Prophet isn’t the worst game I’ve played this year but it could have been so much better. And that’s what’s really unfortunate.
NBA 09 The Inside,PlayStation 3,Oct-7-2008,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,DarkStation,60,Unless you are dying to check out The Life on NBA 09: The Inside you have better basketball choices this holiday season.
Shark Tale,PC,Sep-27-2004,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,PC Gamer,62,Do be advised that the game is shockingly short: If you were to pay it and watch the movie side-by-side itd be a toss-up as to which youd finish first. [Holiday 2004 p.93]
X-Men: Next Dimension,GameCube,Oct-15-2002,Exakt,Action | Fighting | 3D,Gaming Age,58,Outside of some lethargic controls there is definitely some fun to be had with this brawler.
Alpha Protocol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,Totally360,60,There are some really good things about this game. Unfortunately they are marred by other aspects of the game which are a technical mess.
Spectrobes,DS,Mar-6-2007,Jupiter Corporation,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Worth Playing,60,Spectrobes seems to fall short because of its monotonous method of collecting and the poorly designed battle system.
PixelJunk 4am,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Q-Games,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Music Maker | Music Maker | Application,XGN,55,PixelJunk 4AM should be seen as an instrument instead of a game. Unfortunately the Move-controller does not have too many options and thats why this is an instrument that will not be fun for too long. Its too bad you need other people to give you kudos and gamers will probably miss the traditional game elements which seems to be making PixelJunk 4AM simply not interesting enough.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India,PlayStation 4,Jan-13-2016,Ubisoft | Climax Studios,General | Action Adventure | Linear,PlayStation LifeStyle,60,If you’re a big fan of Assassin’s Creed or enjoyed ACC: China then you can pick this up without hesitation. It’s more of the same gameplay-wise but completely different story and setting-wise.
Airheart: Tales of Broken Wings,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2018,Blindflug Studios,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,COGconnected,58,With simple controls but somewhat awkward combat it has a lot going for it however Airheart lacks an explanation of crafting and the stakes for returning home are far too high making it too great of a punishment to be enjoyable.
DarkStar One: Broken Alliance,Xbox 360,Jul-13-2010,Gaming Minds Studios,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,GameWatcher,60,None of the single pieces of Darkstar are particularly shoddy (voicework aside) but mixed together they form an experience thats largely devoid of anything memorable but also one that remains hypnotically sedate until eventual boredom sets in.
Big Bumpin',Xbox 360,Nov-19-2006,Blitz Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Big Bumpin is a no frills arcade-style gaming at its purest. Bumpin is identical on Xbox and Xbox 360 but the 360 version looks dramatically better and offers online play. [Holiday 2006 p.78]
Citadel: Forged with Fire,Xbox One,Nov-1-2019,Blue Isle Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,ZTGD,55,I didn’t mind Citadel. It was the first of its style that I have ever actually played. I now realize the open world sandbox do whatever you want kind of games are not really for me but I can easily see fans of this genre can have some fun here even with the shallow quest system some clunky controls and the technical issues.
Dogos,Xbox One,Sep-7-2016,INTERNET URL S.A.,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,IGN Italia,60,Dogos tries to recreate the feeling that shrouded lates 80s coin-op cabinets adding to the recipe a pinch of contemporaneity. Sadly the result is a tasteless shootem up.
NBA 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2007,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Operation Sports,60,In the end it appears its going to be a long year on the bench for NBA 08.
Windlands,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,CGMagazine,60,This wonderful looking Spider-Man simulator in the sky doesnt live up to its full potential.
Major League Baseball 2K8,Wii,Mar-3-2008,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Cheat Code Central,54,At the end of the day if the Wii is all you have got then this a decent baseball game to pickup. Just dont expect it to be revolutionary or live up to the other versions.
The World Next Door,Switch,Mar-27-2019,Rose City Games,Action Adventure | General,Game Informer,60,Outside of the art style The World Next Door feels generic and doesn’t do enough to make the adventure feel exciting. I expected something to pay off in the long run whether it was the story my choices or time I spent with characters but I instead ended the game saying That’s it? It made me feel like I wasted my time getting to know this world and the people who inhabit it.
Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,PlayStation 4,Feb-24-2015,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,DarkZero,60,Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires feels eerily similar to Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires with all the characters from Dynasty Warriors 8 so if you played that game then you can probably skip this unimaginative release.
The Immortals of Terra: A Perry Rhodan Adventure,PC,Jul-3-2008,Braingame,Adventure | 3D | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person,GamingExcellence,55,Immortals is not a game that I would choose to play in order to relax or pass the time in the airport.
NBA Live 07,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2006,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Sim,Cheat Code Central,60,A severe disappointment to fans of the genre. While EA has added many of the features that were missing from last year’s offering there are still too many issues that need to be ironed out including the animations the flow the online gameplay and the challenge.
Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings,PSP,Jun-9-2009,Amaze Entertainment | Amaze,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,Absolute Games,58,This game is worth your while only if you take it as an interactive movie of sorts – somewhat shallow and anachronistic but with adventures and a couple of silly puzzles to boot.
Eragon,DS,Nov-14-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Action RPG | General | Fantasy | Beat-'Em-Up | Japanese-Style | 3D,Nintendojo,61,Eragon will take about six to seven hours to beat with little reason to go back and do it all again. The game looks fantastic despite being a run-of-the-mill action/adventure game.
Sniper Elite III,Xbox One,Jul-1-2014,Rebellion,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic,The Digital Fix,60,Sniper Elite III continues to evolve the series and it’s evident that Rebellion have attempted to open up the franchise offering more freedom. Unfortunately this comes at the cost of a pure sniping experience – something most will be looking for given the title.
Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines,PSP,Nov-17-2009,Griptonite Games,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Absolute Games,59,The game keeps with the spirit of the original Assassin’s Creed but fails to comply with the letter. Its technical flaws outweigh the artistic merits.
Penny-Punching Princess,Switch,Apr-3-2018,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,DarkZero,60,Truly Penny-Punching Princess feels more like an indie experiment than a full-fledged game and that’s totally fine. It’s fun at it’s core and the feeling of repetition can be kept at bay by playing in small bursts making it perfect for its target consoles – the Switch and the Vita. With that said I simply can’t recommend this title at the current price of almost a full triple-A game. I mean there are a bunch of incredible games on the e-shop that aren’t even half the price.
Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche,Switch,Apr-1-2020,WayForward,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,Comicbook.com,60,Catgirl Without Salad: Amuse Bouche is a delightful sugar rush of a game thats over far too quickly. Its a wildly funny game with gorgeous visuals and terrific voice-acting. Unfortunately the game is over far too soon and once the three levels have been cleared there just isnt much else to do. The game doesnt overstay its welcome and that helps the joke land in a way that few other games could pull off. As such many players will find that the games humor and style are well worth the $7.99 cost of admission but others might want to wait for Shantae and the Seven Sirens instead.
The Godfather II,PC,Apr-7-2009,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Adventure | Third-Person | Historic | Linear | Open-World | Modern,ActionTrip,58,EA had a chance to deliver a really cool game and to improve upon the sequel. They seemed to have failed on both fronts.
Bounty Hounds,PSP,Sep-13-2006,Xpec,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Edge Magazine,60,In the great crapshoot of Namco thirdperson action games it’s a better than average throw. [Nov 2006 p.92]
Genesis Alpha One,PlayStation 4,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,DualShockers,45,Gathering the necessary resources to fulfill a Genesis mission can take a lot of time especially if you end up getting pushed back by hostile invasions. There is a base sense of joy to be had from making the numbers go up but I never completed a Genesis mission and I doubt whatever feeling or reward it gives was worth the effort to reach it. I think it is more than enough to say I have no interest in playing more of it just to confirm what I already know: it’s not great.
Dr. Luigi,Wii U,Dec-31-2013,Arika | Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,NowGamer,40,Dr Luigi is a solid example of the Tetris-like puzzler but doesnt do anywhere near enough to justify the price of admission.
Armored Core 4,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2007,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,1UP,40,AC4 feels like a house thats been added onto so often that its a maze of twisting passages oddly shaped rooms and doors that go nowhere. There may be something worthwhile hidden within but its not worth the effort to find it. Time to tear it all down and start over.
Kill la Kill: IF,Switch,Jul-26-2019,Studio TRIGGER | Aplus,Action Adventure | General | Action | Fighting | 3D,Cubed3,50,Kill la Kill the Game: IF has fun gameplay and a very appealing visual style but it is let down by its inaccessible story mode and lack of content to incentivise prolonged play. The small cast of characters is forgivable because of how unique and fun each one is to play but its difficult to justify buying this at the full retail price when it runs so light on content. Nevertheless the fanservice and unmistakable Kill la Kill flair is likely to delight fans but aside from a few amusing unlockables in the gallery mode there is little to sustain them beyond playing online.
NASCAR 09,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2008,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Stock Car | Stock Car | Automobile,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,Another below-par racer that makes turning left every five seconds exactly as exhilarating as it sounds. [Sept 2008 p.103]
Mazes of Fate,Game Boy Advance,Dec-6-2006,Sabarasa Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Digital Entertainment News,40,You can find better RPGs for the GBA period. Its something of a diamond in the rough its just a bit too rough to recommend.
198X,Switch,Jan-23-2020,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,Metro GameCentral,50,A mawkish attempt to glorify the 80s that features some gorgeous visuals and music but offers no real insight into the era’s culture or games.
SingStar Celebration,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,PLAY! Zine,30,Singstar wants to be karaoke for PS4 but with its very limited song list on the disk and a huge paid DLC library you would do best to find a different karaoke solution. Think YouTube.
Pro Cycling Manager Season 2013: Le Tour de France - 100th Edition,PC,Jun-20-2013,Cyanide,Alternative | Biking | Sports | Individual | Biking,Gamer.nl,40,A new Tour de France a new Pro Cycling Manager 2013. It almost seems to be a copy of the previous game. And a copy of the one that came out before that with the footnote that it has a few very nasty bugs. Hopefully Cyanide understands that they will have to go all out next year.
Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor - Martyr,PlayStation 4,Aug-23-2018,Maximum Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General,GameSpew,50,If you’re dedicated to Warhammer 40000’s world you may get some joy out of this but Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor – Martyr is anything but to-die-for.
The Baconing,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Gaming Age,33,It certainly feels like this game was made to hit a deadline rather than grow the franchise. I couldnt help but think it was a money-grab title.
Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo,Wii,Oct-20-2009,Media Vision,Action | Adventure | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Games Master UK,40,Can we have it this simple but a bit bigger? [Dec 2009 p.87]
Heavy Weapon: Atomic Tank,PlayStation 3,Jun-11-2009,PopCap,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,PS3bloggen.se,50,This is a perfect time killing game. It is simple and relatively minimalistic yet strangely entertaining if you overlook its core gameplay. Heavy Weapon was originally designed for the web and it shows as it utilizes very little of the power the PS3 has to offer. Sadly the web is really where this game belongs not on a cutting edge gaming machine. Save your money pal.
Skelattack,PlayStation 4,Jun-2-2020,Ukuza,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN Spain,50,Skelattack is a game with good ideas but poor execiution. The mechanics are flawed and originality doesnt exist. However the art saves the dishes a bit and offers some charisma.
Fragments of Him,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Sassybot,Adventure | Visual Novel,Gameblog.fr,50,Fragments of Him feels like an incomplete package a short and quite disappointing experience that fails to go satisfyingly deeper in its character development and to move us.
Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2014,Aqua Plus,Real-Time | Fantasy | Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | Visual Novel | General,CalmDownTom,40,The more that a tactics game relies on story than gameplay the more it betrays a lack of self-confidence in the ability of its mechanics to sell the game. It’s the equivalent of an 80s B-Movie that is selling you on its cover art alone.
Band Hero,DS,Nov-3-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GamePro,40,As for the game itself I like to call it Band Hero: Abridged. The set list is varied fun and up to date with tunes from Avril Lavigne to The Rolling Stones. However without a career mode you have access to all 30 songs from the start.
Aven Colony,PC,Jul-25-2017,Mothership Entertainment,Strategy | Management | Government,Polygon,50,I spent the equivalent of a working week playing Aven Colony and it was hard labor. This is a game of relentless concentration and chore-work with only the briefest flashes of magic and relief offering almost nothing new to the city building or resource management genres.
Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe,3DS,Aug-29-2014,HAL Labs,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Impulsegamer,40,Unfortunately Drum Dash Deluxe is neither deep nor long enough to be worth the $7 asking price it stands at currently.
Antigraviator,PC,Jun-6-2018,Iceberg Interactive,Racing | Arcade | Futuristic,4Players.de,33,This is more a tech demo than a coherent game - stay away until it is fixed.
Obscure,PlayStation 2,Apr-6-2005,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,40,Maneuvering and combat are both very clumsy and the whole game leaves you wondering about the choices the game designers made. [June 2005 p.95]
How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition,PlayStation 4,Nov-4-2014,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Survival,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,55,Fun in small doses with a mate otherwise monotonous ugly and done better elsewhere. [January 2015 p82]
Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes,Wii,Oct-12-2010,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,GameSpot,45,Shallow mindless hack-and-slash action makes this a crushingly tedious slog through an anachronistic version of 16th-century Japan.
Bee Movie Game,PlayStation 2,Oct-30-2007,Beenox,Action | General,GamesRadar+,50,Dont force us to play the minigames to expand the already-uninspiring campaign. Its sloppy game design and it drags Bee Movie Game even further into the mud.
Crash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2007,Radical Entertainment,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,A loose kids game that could do with some titaning up. [Dec 2007 p.90]
NHL 08,PC,Sep-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,PC Gamer,35,EA Sports has once again screwed PC owners over with a cut-rate edition of one of its big fall sports games and NHL 08 is even more of a disappointment than its football and golf comrades. [Holiday 2007 p.83]
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,40,At certain points you simply feel total frustration - you just wanna stop playing sometimes. Of course youre better off never starting at all. [Dec 2003 p.162]
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PC,Nov-15-2001,KnowWonder,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,55,Underwhelms with an extremely brief story overly simplistic platform jumping sequences and repetitive gameplay...Suitable only for children.
Stretch Panic,PlayStation 2,Aug-28-2001,Treasure,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSX Nation,30,Control is atrocious characters extremely odd and unappealing IMHO (your mileage may vary on this one) rewards for your trouble very minimal graphics/sounds very underwhelming.
Off-Road Redneck Racing,PC,May-2-2001,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Yahoo!,40,Its saving grace might have been the potential it had to provide a more jovial spirit in the Redneck Rampage theme but this is never really accomplished.
Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition,Dreamcast,Oct-28-2000,Climax Entertainment,Driving | Mission-based,Da Gameboyz,48,None of these elements can make up for the sloppy control that destroys any attempt at fun.
Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour,Dreamcast,Jul-19-2000,Crystal Dynamics,Driving | Racing | Kart,Sega X,34,Its one thing to have poor track design but its another thing to leave out Mickey and Donald rip-off of others and allow the game to suffer from slow-down.
Afro Samurai,PlayStation 3,Jan-27-2009,Namco Bandai Games America | Namco Bandai Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpy,40,Afro Samurai is a mess of a game. Its such a shame to see such a beautifully rendered and stylish world ground into the dust by such staggering gameplay foibles and technical glitches.
Brothers in Arms: D-Day,PSP,Dec-5-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Pocket Gamer UK,50,D-Days strategic undertones are welcome but overall the game is too drawn out and generally lacking in tension to truly captivate other than in short sporadic bursts.
Lovely Planet,Xbox One,Jan-8-2016,QUICKTEQUILA,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,TrueAchievements,50,If youre in search of a game to play pass the controller with in a group of shooter-loving friends Lovely Planet may be worth checking out but is otherwise easily worth a pass.
Mini Ninjas Adventures,Xbox 360,Jun-29-2012,Side Kick LTD,Action | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Gets very repetitive. [Issue#88 p.83]
Powerstar Golf,Xbox One,Nov-22-2013,Zoe Mode,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade,Games Master UK,40,Not new-gen material. [Jan 2014 p.63]
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,Xbox 360,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,52,Distinctly underwhelming. [Christmas 2011 p.106]
Dead Space 2: Severed,PlayStation 3,Mar-1-2011,Visceral Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamerNode,40,Severed places an ungainly weight on the shoulders of dismemberment combat for this extension of Dead Space: Extractions fiction creating a dichotomy as uncomfortable as traipsing backwards through already tired levels.
Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli,Wii,Aug-26-2008,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Other | Other | GT / Street | Automobile,HellBored,49,Frustrating boring and ordinary ... three words that should not be associated with Ferrari.
Just Cause 4,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Slant Magazine,40,It doesnt matter how cool an individual set piece looks if all the smaller scenes leading up to it are marred by unresponsive vehicles dumb AI and shoddy physics.
Tekken Hybrid,PlayStation 3,Nov-22-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameShark,25,I honestly dont know why anyone would buy Tekken Hybrid. If you love Tekken Tag Tournament theres no reason to drop $40 on this head scratcher when theres a likely superior current sequel in the cards that will offer the online play and other mod cons that this remaster doesnt. The prologue should have been a free download.
Brave: The Video Game,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,Disney Interactive Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Linear,Digital Spy,40,Though not without its charms the mediocre gameplay and unambitious level design makes Brave feel more like a downloadable release than a fully-fledged retail title.
Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code,PSP,Mar-28-2006,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,PSW Magazine UK,30,The online mode featuring co-op play and deathmatches for up to three other players almost salvages the game but the sheer tedium of the rest of it sinks it.
Skully,Switch,Aug-4-2020,Finish Line Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamer Escape,30,I always feel a little bad being hard on a game. I know some people put a lot of work into this and they may even be proud of it but the simple truth of the matter is I did not have fun. I didn’t even feel the satisfaction of overcoming a challenge. Whenever I thought I’d find something I enjoyed the NPCs would snipe insults at each other and make me feel awkward about being around them.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2,PlayStation Vita,Aug-18-2015,Frima Studio,Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,IGN Italia,50,A good game ruined by a flawed conversion. If possible it’s better to buy it for another platform.
Farming Simulator 2013,PC,Oct-25-2012,Giants Software,Miscellaneous | General | Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,PC PowerPlay,50,This gets three bonus points for being less snooty than Agricultural Simulator 2012 which clearly has some kind of underdog issue. [Dec 2012 p.84]
Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Battle March,PC,Sep-2-2008,Black Hole Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Informer,50,While the controls arent as big a deal on the PC the spotty AI poor pacing and lack of depth doom both versions. [Nov 2008 p.118]
Crayola Treasure Adventures,DS,Oct-1-2007,Crave,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,DarkZero,40,There is fun to be had here for children who are particularly fond of colouring and puzzles but if they’re that keen you can get the real thing for a tiny fraction of the cost of this (as well as being able to look at your work later) and so there’s little reason to buy Crayola Treasure Adventures.
Delta Force: Xtreme,PC,Apr-22-2005,NovaLogic,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Format,42,Pointless in the xtreme unless youre interested in war game archaeoogy. [July 2005 p.97]
Battleship,Xbox One,Aug-2-2016,Frima Studio,Miscellaneous | Board / Card Game,Stevivor,40,The entire point of Battleship is that you are face to face with your opponent and cannot see their ship layout. Relying on good sportsmanship not to peek is an unnecessary complication. In all honesty I think this game makes more sense on a portable device or mobile phone both for convenience and the basic logic of the game itself. Even at around $20 AUD it doesn’t seem worth the expense for a new mode alone.
Depth,PC,Nov-3-2014,Digital Confectioners,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,SpazioGames,50,Depth is certainly a game with an interesting idea but developed in a rather rough manner leaving more than a doubt not only on the production value but also on the idea of the asymmetric gameplay which is apparently riding the wave of enthusiasm born with Evolve.
Titan Quest,Switch,Jul-31-2018,THQ Nordic,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Trusted Reviews,40,Ultimately this is a 12-year-old game and no amount of spit and polish can overcome the dated mechanics and repetitive combat that lies at its core.
James Bond 007: Blood Stone,PlayStation 3,Nov-2-2010,Bizarre Creations,Action | Driving | Shooter | Mission-based | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,RealGamer,40,Blood Stone is definitely not one of 007s best missions.
ZEN Pinball 2: Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron,PlayStation 4,Apr-22-2015,Zen Studios,Action | Pinball,GamingTrend,45,Zen Pinball 2’s Age of Ultron table doesn’t offer enough fan service to appease any level of Avengers fan and there aren’t enough interesting mechanics to excite a virtual pinball fan.

Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta,Xbox 360,Aug-3-2009,Bethesda Softworks,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,GameCritics,35,If Mothership Zeta had been half as long and available at half the price it might have been worthwhile simply for giving players a quick peek behind the origins of the main games enigmatic alien wreckage. As it stands this dog-leg jaunt into outer space ends up a giant could-have-been without any real reason to recommend it save completion for completions sake.

Dead or School,Switch,Mar-13-2020,Studio Nanafushi,Action Adventure | General,Switch Player,30,Dead or School often intrigues in appearance but never quite capitalises on the unique blend of the mundane. Technical issues bog down the core experience and the lack of restriction or respect for the rest of the content sours what could have been a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the underground.
Conarium,PlayStation 4,Feb-12-2019,Zoetrope Interactive,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,4Players.de,60,The foundation sounds promising but storytelling as well as puzzle mechanics lack suspense challenge and dynamics.
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,PC,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Computer Games Magazine,40,Toss in s shoddy padlock system that provides dramatic views of your plane but tends to throw off your aim completely and you end up with an arcade game thats more difficult to play than a full-blown simulation. [July 2006 p.63]
Serious Sam: Next Encounter,PlayStation 2,Apr-22-2004,Climax Group,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Thunderbolt,30,The game is a real mess with shoddy graphics a badly constructed and executed plot repetitive and flawed gameplay bland multiplayer elements and a serious lack of atmosphere.

Trillion: God of Destruction,PlayStation Vita,Mar-29-2016,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Destructoid,30,Trillion: God of Destruction isnt a game its a job; and not a very good one. This isnt something that should be played at home but instead in a cubical on a desk surrounded by unsigned TPS reports while Becky from accounting reminds you to sign Bills birthday card before he goes home for the day. And while the company you work for may be interesting the work you do is so mind-numbingly banal you cant help but wonder if your skills could be put to better use somewhere else.
Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns,DS,Jul-22-2008,Ninja Studio,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Roguelike,GameCritics,50,Being average isnt a bullet-point for the back of a box and if someones going to play a potentially punishing definitely repetitive roguelike I cant imagine that theyd want to put that kind of serious effort out for something thats just average at best.
007: Quantum of Solace,DS,Nov-4-2008,Vicarious Visions,Action | Action Adventure | General | Modern | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Modojo,40,Do yourself a favor and go see the flick instead. Its cheaper and will give you bigger bang for your buck than this misfire.

They’re all here but that’s where the fun ends. Overall this is a functional but unexciting trip to the races.
Dig Dug: Digging Strike,DS,Oct-18-2005,Bullets,Action | Platformer | General | Platformer | 2D | 2D,The Sydney Morning Herald,50,Its a shame the innovative DS touch screen is hardly used here - play only requires use of the directional pad and buttons.

Battle Princess Madelyn,Switch,Dec-20-2018,Causal Bit Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cubed3,50,The arcade mode trims most of the fat but it lacks the challenge and polish that defined the arcade era.
Poi: Explorer Edition,Switch,Oct-23-2017,PolyKid,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cubed3,40,Devoid of both style and substance Poi is perhaps the least interesting 3D platformer currently available for the Nintendo Switch. Not only is it mechanically shallow with a relatively skill ceiling and floor the level design rarely if ever gets creative enough to mask how lacklustre the platforming can be. To make matters worse this is just charmless all around thanks to an incredibly safe aesthetic that renders a potentially fascinating world completely unmemorable. This neither reinvents platforming nor serves as a suitable love letter to the genre ensuring it is best left forgotten.
Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,Namco Bandai Games | Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,RPGamer,30,At the end of the day Re: Hollow Fragment is lazy in every sense of the word and just isnt worth the dollars that Bandai Namco is asking for.

War the Game,PC,Jan-12-2015,GabberGames,Strategy | Real-Time | Military,Games.cz,40,Its low price tag is not enough to overshadow the fact that War the Game delivers minimum content. Although it is natural to raise objections to its strategical aspect a small number of scenarios and no multiplayer game are the things that are fatally snapping its neck.
MachiaVillain,PC,May-16-2018,Wild Factor,Action | General,Games Master UK,45,A well-presented game but exploring shows its more dilapidated cabin than ominous mansion. [July 2018 p.65]
Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D,3DS,Jun-28-2011,Capcom,Action | Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Shooter | Survival | Third-Person | Tactical,1UP,25,Its hard to shake the feeling that Mercenaries 3D is the slimy result of a Capcom executive meeting titled What can we get away with this time?
Cate West: The Vanishing Files,Wii,Mar-23-2009,Destineer,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Nintendo Gamer,59,An acquired taste and definitely not for impatient gamers. [Nov 2009 p.69]
Birthdays the Beginning,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Arc System Works,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon | Action Adventure | Sandbox,GameCritics,45,While I absolutely love the concept of Birthdays: The Beginning the execution leaves much to be desired. It’s too passive and too finicky and doesn’t do enough with the core concept of life appearing and evolving over time. There’s not much here for seasoned players or curious kids and as someone who’s been playing games for a while I can say that this formula was done far far better on the SNES back in 1993 with EVO: Search For Eden. Look it up!
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,Xbox,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamePro,40,It has some slick production values and Acclaim goes all out on dreamy visuals gorgeously detailed architecture a Vikingly heroic score and juicy sound effects but skimps on any kind of depth and rewarding gameplay.
EyePet & Friends,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,SCEE London Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,55,Like in the previous Eyepet-games you never really get the feeling that you are actually petting the animals. Yes the animal reacts to the Move but the interaction is very limited. Its fun to toy around with the technology for a while but after that it gets boring. [December 2011 p.89]
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands,PSP,May-17-2010,Ubisoft Quebec,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamekult,40,A mediocre game well forget quite easily.

Gauntlet,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,Digital Eclipse,Action | General | General | Arcade,WHAM! Gaming,30,The worst part is you can basically hit a button to get more and more health as opposed to adding quarters in the arcades back in the day.
Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain,PlayStation 2,May-4-2004,Sony Bend,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,Gaming Age,16,Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain easily ranks among the worst titles I have ever played on the PlayStation 2 an astounding feat considering that the game came from Sony themselves.
Lords of the Realm III,PC,Mar-17-2004,Impressions Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General,Computer and Video Games,19,God knows what happened to LOTR3 but the usually dependable Impressions Games has lost the plot on this one. Even if youre a long-standing fan of the series - no especially if you are one - avoid this like a bearded Black Death-infected Saxon whore.
Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus,Xbox,Mar-18-2003,Studio Gigante,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpy,38,It takes a few stabs at innovating but alas its turned out to be worse than mediocre: its lousy.
Strike Fighters: Project 1,PC,Oct-27-2002,Third Wire,Simulation | Flight | Old Jet | Combat,Computer Gaming World,40,Numerous bugs and missing features indicate Strike Fighters was pushed out the door a few months before its time. Again. [Mar 2003 p.105]

Tennis Masters Series,PC,Nov-18-2001,Microids,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,Yahoo!,40,Yet another addition to the long line of awful tennis games for the PC.
Hoard,PC,Apr-4-2011,Big Sandwich Games | Inc.,Action | General | General,Gaming Age,42,The problem I found is that it felt like the RTS equivalent of button mashing; if I lost Id just as soon turn it off than feel all that compelled to try a different strategy. A shame really because theres nothing technically wrong with the game.
Juiced: Eliminator,PSP,Jun-28-2006,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Modojo,40,Juiced: Eliminator isnt bottom of the barrel but it comes in at a distant third when the underground racing genre has already gone well into its life span and thats not good news.
Party Hard,PlayStation 4,Apr-26-2016,Pinokl Games,Action | General,DarkStation,50,Party Hard presents some interesting ideas and has a promising start but it sours quickly due to repetitive game design and a frustrating inconsistency in difficulty.
MS Saga: A New Dawn,PlayStation 2,Feb-21-2006,Bandai,Role-Playing | General,Yahoo!,40,A game with no surprises and a superficial combat model but giant robot fetishists and long-time series fans at least have one less reason to complain.
Away: Shuffle Dungeon,DS,Oct-30-2008,Mistwalker | Artoon,Role-Playing | General | General,Metro GameCentral,40,Its all a shame because the central idea of a constantly transforming dungeon is a good one. The actual game thats been constructed around it though is nowhere near good enough.
Wild West Guns,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Gameloft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,Zentendo,50,Wild West Guns is best looked at as perhaps a good first attempt. It has good settings and sound to suck you in to the Wild West theme but the actual gameplay just falls short. The controls are great and responsive but the game itself is just too repetitive and gets boring quickly. If more variety had been added then perhaps a higher score could have been given.
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PSP,Dec-11-2005,Crave,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,AceGamez,40,It isnt a terrible game but neither is it a good one. For those wanting to play a game of poker without the hassle of dealing cards or finding friends to play against then this game is an adequate substitute.
Crash 'N' Burn,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Arcade,The Sydney Morning Herald,50,While the cars in other games fold and dent realistically depending on the speed and direction of the impact damage to Crash n Burns cars seems artificial with entire panels suddenly replaced with scratched versions at the merest hint of a high-speed nudge.
Need for Speed Underground 2,DS,May-10-2005,EA Canada,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Pelaaja (Finland),40,The unique capabilities of DS’s dual screens are not used very well. Touch screen serves only as a map and as touch activation for nitro boost. As a driving game NFSU 2 DS does not feed the need for speed. Driving simply feels too slow paced. [August 2005 p.68]
Painkiller: Overdose,PC,Oct-26-2007,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PC Zone UK,38,A headache. [Feb 2008 p.88]
Bee Simulator,Switch,Nov-12-2019,Varsav Game Studios,Simulation | General,DarkZero,40,The premise for Bee Simulator is good and I like the idea of doing education through video games in such a uniquely refreshing way but the execution here has problems. When the game is not asking much from the player then Bee Simulator ends up being somewhat fun with a great sense of scale but the controls hamper such an important part of the game that the experience ends up being frustrating. Throw in repetitive tasks and muddy visuals and what you have is a video game that sadly does not deliver on its potential. It is hard to recommend Bee Simulator out right especially at its asking price but some of the younger kids might enjoy what Bee Simulator has to offer.
Morphite,Switch,Nov-2-2017,Crescent Moon Games,Action Adventure | General,TheSixthAxis,30,There is such a thing as being too laid-back and Morphite is most certainly that. With visuals that are too basic and lacking in character an almost sleep inducing pace and some technical issues on Switch that can’t be ignored there are few redeeming qualities for this utter snooze-fest.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,DS,Nov-14-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gaming Age,25,The graphics are there as is some of the sound and a few decent gameplay elements but the boring combat system repetitive scenery and horrible menu set up really keeps the game from ever becoming more than a mediocre waste of time.
Arena Football,Xbox,Feb-7-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,G4 TV,40,Arena Football may be an engaging sport to watch in real life with the excitement of packed arenas and the promise of frenzied action on the shortened field but the developers did a poor job in conveying that sense of atmosphere in the game.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1: In Too Deep,Xbox One,Feb-23-2016,Skybound LLC | Skybound Games,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Its easy to accredit the success of Telltales original Walking Dead to the strength of the fiction its working with but this flat opening salvo lacks the same nuances. [Apr 2016 p.77]
Sparkle 2,Xbox One,Jan-27-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Puzzle | Matching,We Got This Covered,30,Sparkle 2 is a clone of an almost 20 year old game and does nothing interesting with the core idea introduced in Puzz Loop.
Prince of Persia Revelations,PSP,Dec-6-2005,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Fantasy | Linear,NTSC-uk,30,People wanting a game to get their teeth into will certainly find it a challenge although many will also be tearing their hair out by the handful. The one question on many people’s lips is why port Warrior Within of all the games in the Prince of Persia trilogy? Why not simply begin with Sands of Time and start at the beginning.
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2005,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,GamerFeed,40,While it captures the sweet essence of the film from so long ago it fails to motivate with its stale gameplay.
Outward,Xbox One,Mar-26-2019,Nine Dots Studio,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Survival | Open-World,GameSpew,50,It’s undeniable that Outward‘s combat is sub-par and that its systems prove to be very punishing when combined.
Choplifter HD,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2012,InXile Entertainment,General | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Gameblog.fr,40,The concept gameplay challenge and atmosphere of Choplifter HD are quite good. It is a nice trip back in the 80s even if it is far from being a must-have today as the game is particulary repetitive and its price is quite high.
Cookie & Cream,DS,Jul-2-2007,Hi Corp,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GamesRadar+,30,There’s some minigames and a wi-fi Battle mode but good luck trying to play with a friend more than once. We wanted to adore Cookie & Cream; it’s a shame we only get a clumsy mess.
Secret Files: Tunguska,Wii,Jun-22-2010,10tacle Studios | Fusionsphere Systems,Adventure | Third-Person | General | Modern,games(TM),50,Dedicated genre fans meanwhile will find that the concessions in the gameplay – pre-highlighted hot spots and rumble hints – are both insulting to their intelligence and at odds with the entire point of the adventure genre. [June 2008 p.123]
Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon,PC,Aug-21-2008,Kheops Studio,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,GameSpot,50,Dreary and dated.
The Awakened Fate: Ultimatum,PlayStation 3,Mar-17-2015,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | General | Roguelike,PlayStation Universe,40,A shell of its predecessor. All the fun mechanics from Guided Fate Paradox have been removed and changed leaving a generic but tedious combat system. The story while potentially interesting has major pacing and voice acting issues that dull the experience. Only a diehard NIS fan will want to play this game.
Blacklight: Tango Down,PC,Jul-14-2010,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),50,Absences of multi-player opponents and lack of any in-game improvements are the major disadvantages of this average first person shooter. [Issue#195]
Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,PC,Jun-10-2016,Frogwares,Adventure | General,PCWorld,40,Three weak cases one decent and a lackluster finale make Sherlock Holmes: The Devils Daughter a marked step back from its predecessor.
Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond,PlayStation 3,Jan-7-2010,Vicious Cycle,Action | Action Adventure | Modern | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GameShark,33,If it wasn’t bad enough that the game pokes fun at its previous release saying it can be picked at a bargain bin near you and continues the self-deprecating with a quip at the end dealing with the dreadfulness you just played through one can’t help but agree and have a sort of resentment that the developers knew the game was not up to par with other XBLA - or even Xbox Live Indie games - but still went ahead and released it which is probably the most humorous thing the game has going for it.
Blair Witch,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,Push Square,40,Blair Witchs strongest aspect -- its eerie woodland setting -- is perfect for a focused streamlined horror experience. Unfortunately thats not what this game is and the superfluous gimmicky gameplay mechanics that are thrown at you with reckless abandon only serve to make the game less effective as a whole. A disappointing story frustrating level design and precious few genuine scares leaves us hoping that this is one franchise that gets lost in the woods.
Metal Wolf Chaos XD,PC,Aug-6-2019,From Software | General Arcade,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,GameSpot,40,Metal Wolf Chaos is an old game with a wild reputation and though it lives up to it in some ways its not good in general. At best its a curio that helps inform the story of From Softwares trajectory over the years. At worst its a frustratingly shallow experience that fails to capitalize on its best qualities.
Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 2,Xbox One,Feb-5-2019,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Xbox Tavern,50,Considering that it’s a sequel and despite its efforts Monster Energy Supercross 2 doesn’t feel wholly refined overall. The game suffers considerably due to its loose handling its steep difficulty curve and its excessive loading times. That said there’s enough diverse content on offer to keep die-hard fans entertained until next time. Just don’t expect the quality to have come on in leaps and bounds in comparison to its predecessor.
Smash Hit Plunder,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,Triangular Pixels,Strategy | General,PlayStation Country,50,Smash Hit Plunder is an accessible looting game that sticks to one simple concept which is smashing everything in sight. It works well for a while but fell a bit flat after repeated play sessions. The asynchronous multiplayer options are a nice addition but you might struggle to find players who want to play this more than once.
Gekido: Kintaro's Revenge,Switch,Mar-22-2018,Naps Team,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Switch Player,40,Gekido Kintaro’s Revenge is a very simple beat-em-up which probably didn’t warrant a physical release on Switch. Unfair gameplay unsatisfying visuals and sloppy proofing work mean this is one to miss.
Human: Fall Flat,Switch,Dec-7-2017,No Brakes Games,Action Adventure | General,Cubed3,30,Human: Fall Flat on Nintendo Switch is neither good if labelled as a purposely bad game nor as a physics puzzler. Why? It is purely because the controls make things more aggravating than hilarious and secondly due to how uninspiring the puzzles themselves are. Thats why.
Star Wars Battlefront II,PC,Nov-17-2017,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Destructoid,50,As much as I loathe this implementation of loot boxes I still keep playing Battlefront II and I will probably continue to do so on and off. I mean I do like the game. I just wish it wasnt being squandered like this. Youd be well-advised to wait until overhauls arrive -- assuming they ever do.
Xenoraid,PlayStation 4,Nov-8-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons Ltd | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Impulsegamer,50,Xenoraid is competently built but lacks any real reason to actually compel you to play it. The gameplay loop quickly becomes monotonous and aside from quick bursts here and there whilst waiting for a download I can’t see many gamers putting much time into conquering the alien attackers.
Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,ACE Team,Action Adventure | Linear,Twinfinite,40,This game so difficult to play through in the first place: the clunky and robotic feel of your characters and their movements. Extended Dream Edition is a regurgitation of the same nightmare that surfaced last year and I can’t recommend it to anyone who isn’t already utterly enamored with the game’s beautiful aesthetics.
War for the Overworld,PC,Apr-2-2015,Subterranean Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer.nl,45,War for the Overworld was supposed to be the new Dungeon Keeper. They were on the right track but the game that is available for download now is definitely not right; lots of bugs crashes bad AI and many missing features make this game impossible to recommend.
Rio,PlayStation 3,Apr-12-2011,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Miscellaneous | General | General,Gamekult,30,Quotation forthcoming.
Rogue Ops,GameCube,Oct-29-2003,Bits Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,Edge Magazine,20,Objects that can be interacted with are circled with an icon but this only appears if you are looking at exactly the right spot. Indeed much of Rogue Ops is spent trying to make this cursed cursor appear. Its not a pleasant way to spend an evening. [Feb 2004 p.108]
Summer Heat Beach Volleyball,PlayStation 2,Jul-1-2003,Acclaim Studios Cheltenham,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,PSM Magazine,30,Plagued with underdeveloped AI and repetitive clunky gameplay SHBV is one of the least appealing games of 2003. [Sept 2003 p.38]
Gungrave,PlayStation 2,Sep-16-2002,Seta Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Game Revolution,33,A great animated cartoon cleverly disguised as a rather lame Playstation 2 game. Great presentation is wasted on forgettable gameplay.
Mad Maestro!,PlayStation 2,Mar-12-2002,Desert Productions,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Game Revolution,33,Pressing one button over and over at different pressure levels doesnt ring my bell and I doubt it will ring most of yours.
Darkened Skye,PC,Jan-27-2002,Boston Animation,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Fantasy,Game Revolution,50,Rather than mixing action adventure and puzzle a narrower focus with more snide remarks and witty writing would have led to a better game.
Monsters Inc. Scream Team,PlayStation,Oct-30-2001,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General,Game Revolution,50,Fine for its intended audience. Simple gameplay with familiar heroes is enough to keep the little ones occupied for a while. Just dont expect anyone over the age of six to go ga-ga over it.
Thunderstrike: Operation Phoenix,PlayStation 2,Oct-15-2001,Core Design Ltd.,Action | Simulation | Shooter | Flight | Third-Person | Helicopter | Modern,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,Why does the game look like crap? [Jan 2002 p.141]
Yoshi's New Island,3DS,Mar-14-2014,Arzest,Action | Platformer | 2D,Eurogamer,40,It might look a little like Yoshis Island then but its a worse game in every regard. 19 years on from the original its design has been denuded of almost everything that made it great: a series once fecund with ideas is now coasting on past glories.
Alpha Protocol,PlayStation 3,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,The Escapist,40,The RPG elements work well and are loads of fun to explore but they only add up to half a game. Whats left over is a brainless broken mess.
Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2014,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,4Players.de,41,Reborn – sounds like a new beginning doesn’t it? But it isn’t. This is little more than a superficial sequel that at its core is less satisfying than its predecessor.
F1 2015,Xbox One,Jul-21-2015,Codemasters,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Pure Xbox,40,Were not exactly seeing what the wait was for when it comes to F1 2015. The game is clearly rushed riddled with bugs and lacking in some relatively basic features.
Monopoly Streets,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,Electronic Arts,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Gameblog.fr,40,Monopoly Streets does have some aces to play but cant make us forget that its still funnier with the real tabletop version.
Danger Zone,PC,May-29-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Quarter to Three,40,Danger Zone is good for a couple of fancy crashes and not much else before an uninstall. It’s like a mild hit-and-run where it was never really worth taking the other driver’s insurance information anyway.
Diner Dash: Sizzle & Serve,DS,May-23-2007,Climax Group | PlayFirst | Climax Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General | Action,Nintendo Gamer,45,Its very little fun to play and since you can play a limited version online for free as a Flash game theres no good reason to put it in your DS. [June 2007 p.70]
Mario Party 7,GameCube,Nov-7-2005,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Party,Eurogamer,30,Its such a shame that Nintendo - the creator of Mario Kart which is arguably the most fun you can have with platonic friends - just cant seem to sort Mario Partys problems out even for the seventh instalment in the series. Roll on number eight eh.
Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis,PC,Oct-29-2009,Fusionsphere Systems | Animation Arts,Adventure | General | General,Total PC Gaming,50,An interesting story but the overall package isnt engaging enough. [Issue#20 p.56]
Spyro: A Hero's Tail,Xbox,Nov-3-2004,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,Stuff,40,We grew bored of the sheer repetitiveness of the game play and not even Spyros smart-ass remarks could keep us amused. Just talk to the hand Spyro. Snap!
Onimusha Tactics,Game Boy Advance,Nov-11-2003,Capcom,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Nintendojo,35,Onimusha Tactics wouldnt be that bad if there werent so many strategy games already available to the GBA. But there are. And compared to the rest of the flock Onimusha sucks.
AO Tennis 2,Switch,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,FNintendo,50,AO Tennis 2 on the Nintendo Switch sets expectations high but for a tennis simulation everything falls below the required standards. While the career mode and the player creation tool are interesting the games cast of players feels disconnected from reality while the gameplay feels too demanding and the graphics are simply out of date for the current time. Adding some performance issues to that doesnt make AO Tennis 2 any better and in the end what could have been a good tennis simulation falls into a more disappointing side of the spectrum.
Bloo Kid 2,3DS,May-7-2015,winterworks,Action | Platformer | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,20,Its a horribly generic platformer that tries hard to be some kind of homage to the genres greats and ends up being a pale imitation of them all. Sure its cheap as chips on the Nintendo 3DS but that doesnt mean its worth the time investment.
Naval War: Arctic Circle,PC,Apr-10-2012,Turbo Tape Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General,Everyeye.it,50,Naval War: Artic Circle could have been a good title but it lacks in so many aspects gameplay-wise that in the end it is not very satisfying for the RTS fan. The missions are too simple and the multiplayer should be enhanced with more maps and scenarios. On top of this a poor technical realization.
Go Vacation,Wii,Oct-11-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Gamereactor Sweden,20,When I played Go Vacation I heard the ticking clock of my life eating up the hours as I struggled with the pointless mini-games. You can avoid this. For me its too late.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Autobots,DS,Jun-23-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Adventure | Shooter | Beat-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person | 3D | Arcade,Worth Playing,50,Overall Im not sure that Id suggest Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – Autobots to anyone other than die-hard Transformer fans even though it really doesnt do the franchise any justice.
Gear.Club Unlimited,Switch,Nov-21-2017,Eden Games Mobile,Action | General | Racing | Simulation | Automobile,JeuxActu,45,Gear.Club Unlimited is just a bad port of an otherwise successful mobile racing game. Even if the content is generous the game is expensive the gameplay is a joke the AI is crap and the graphics are ugly. Dont bother with this one if you really like cars and racing games.
Lucky's Tale,PC,Mar-28-2016,Playful Corp.,Action | Platformer | 3D,GameSpot,50,Luckys Tale seems like it would be a good fit for someone who doesnt normally play games and has mild curiosity in VR. Experienced players will certainly appreciate the great controls but thats it. Its hard to get upset about a game thats technically free but its worth acknowledging that Luckys Tale is too basic to get excited about and not inventive enough to communicate the potential of VR.
Crystal Quest,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2006,Stainless Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,Tat. [Issue#5 p.120]
Atari Classics Evolved,PSP,Dec-19-2007,Stainless Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Game Revolution,42,On the one hand there are more than sixty games available in portable form. Some of them have even been genuinely enhanced if youre interested. Unfortunately many players probably wont have the patience to unlock the full library of classics and will be stuck with the eleven that are available from the start.
Dusk Diver,PlayStation 4,Oct-29-2019,JFi Games,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Cubed3,50,Dusk Diver struggles to make a memorable impact due to its story and gameplay failings. This is not helped by its technical issues. Nevertheless despite its blandness there is some charisma beneath the surface thanks to a memorable supporting cast and a clear sense of passion in its worlds conception. Its difficult to recommend it but for those who do give it a go there is a noteworthy personality here that keeps things ticking.
Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2012,Pyramid,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Eurogamer Italy,50,The Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection is pretty dumb. Budokai 3 is still a great game but the lack of any kind of online mode and the crazy absence of Budokai 2 transform a good chance into a sad nonsense.
Conduit 2,Wii,Apr-19-2011,High Voltage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Joystiq,20,Theres only one 4-minute bit in the entire thing that was fun to play and that was tailgunning in the spaceship. So at least the whole review wasnt negative amirite?
Defiance,PC,Apr-2-2013,Trion Worlds,Massively Multiplayer Online | Role-Playing | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Quarter to Three,40,Defiance is mostly lacking meaningful connective tissue. It fails at the fundamental task of feeling like a thoughtfully designed and polished game. It fails at feeling like a world. It fails at giving you much to look forward to once you’ve realized you’ve seen most of what it’s ever going to do. You can only get so far with it’s fun to shoot stuff. About Defiance far.
Battles of Prince of Persia,DS,Dec-6-2005,Ubisoft Montreal,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,Modojo,40,A strategic card battler thats missing out on any fun intuitive design or worst of all a point. Stick to your Advance Wars and leave this battlefield empty.
Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Aspyr | Aspire,Action Adventure | Linear,Cubed3,50,A flawed port that struggles to overcome mediocrity in its implementation and that suffers from a lack of multiplayer leads to a less than stellar experience. Star Wars Jedi Outcast is purely saved by its solid level design and fan service. There are probably better options if you want a good TV experience but nothing can beat this ports portable experience which is in all honestly its saving grace. Recommended for fans looking to take it on holiday and a near miss for fans looking for a Star Wars title worthy of being played in the big screen.
Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters: Daybreak Special Gigs,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Arc System Works | Now Production,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,ZTGD,50,Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters Daybreak is a title that showed a lot of promise with a great art style and an interesting premise. However the atrocious combat mechanics hinder the overall enjoyment of the game so much to the point it’s difficult to recommend to anyone in particular.
Master of Orion 3,PC,Feb-25-2003,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | 4X,GMR Magazine,10,Then theres the weak arbitrary enemy A.I. the impenetrable interface and the absurdly incomplete documentation. [June 2003 p.70]
Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts,Xbox 360,May-17-2011,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,Metro GameCentral,50,A typical Fallout download that buries a few interesting new ideas and locations beneath a patchwork of overfamiliar and increasingly outdated content.
Cargo! The Quest for Gravity,PC,Apr-21-2011,Ice-Pick Lodge,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | General | Fantasy,PC PowerPlay,40,Proof that gleeful surrealism does not automatically indicate arthouse brilliance. [Aug 2011 p.74]
theHunter: Call of the Wild,PC,Feb-16-2017,Expansive Worlds,Sports | Individual | Nature | Hunting,TheSixthAxis,40,When theHunter: Call of the Wild works properly it’s still going to be a game that only those with the patience of a saint would enjoy. It’s very slow full of barriers and isn’t very exciting. That’s not to say it’s not completely without merit as it’s a stunner to look at and there are rare occasions where everything comes together to make a compelling experience. Just note that those rare occasions are few and far between.
StarDrone,PlayStation 3,Apr-5-2011,Beatshapers,Action | General | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,It just isnt any fun. [Apr 2011 p.114]
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2004,Interplay,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Eurogamer,30,If you have any respect for the way games should be made then give Interplay a clear message that it simply has to do better than this to compete in the games market. Treat BOS with contempt it deserves and avoid it at all costs - even buying this at a budget price would be irresponsible.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,PlayStation 2,Dec-8-2003,Paradigm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,games(TM),30,Dilute disjointed and uninspiring. Feeling more like a staggered set of obstacles than a wholesome game the action sadly boils down to little more than a tediously dull showcase for your equipment and abilities which are put into use against some questionable AI stooges. [Jan 2004 p.118]
Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm,PC,Sep-26-2002,3DO,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General,Computer Gaming World,30,Its a lot more of the same - the same grinding disenchantment. [Feb 2003 p.80]
ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Gaming Age,42,No matter what type of game you are looking for the control takes some getting used to.
Silent Scope 2: Dark Silhouette,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2001,KCET,Action | Shooter | Rail,Game Revolution,42,This is one port that went from arcade star to console dog. Heinous dude.
Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff,PlayStation 2,Apr-18-2001,New World Computing,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG,PSX Nation,40,If you love this series on PC then stick to it there because the essence of what makes HMM is just hinted at on PS2.
Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business,PC,Nov-30-2000,Sir-Tech Software Inc.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | Tactics,Daily Radar,0,A pale shadow of a flawed but fun game. If the designers do not have more in them than this the Jagged Alliance series should end here.
Assassin's Creed Liberation HD,PlayStation 3,Jan-14-2014,Ubisoft Sofia,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Playstation Official Magazine UK,50,Sadly Liberation can’t escape its limited gameplay technical unevenness and poorly told story. While Black Flag kicked the series on the past holds no glory for Aveline.
UEFA Euro 2012,PC,Apr-24-2012,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,GRYOnline.pl,35,A waek game in almost every aspect - the most painful being missing licences and castrated game modes that were supposed to be the biggest advantages of this game. Well made stadiums supporters songs and new commentary track are not enough to justify a high price tag.
We Cheer 2,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Machatin | Inc.,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,Game Revolution,42,I guess if you find yourself in need of a game for a preppy young lass this could be a recipe for success. If youre a fan of rhythm games there isnt anything here of substance so any fun you have while waving to an imaginary virtual jailbait kid wont last too long.
Murder in the Abbey,PC,Aug-26-2008,Alcachofa Soft,Adventure | General | General,IGN,35,The back of the box promises 40 hours of gameplay. You do not want 40 hours of gameplay here.
Wild ARMs XF,PSP,Mar-11-2008,Media Vision,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,1UP,42,The game has some ambition and I admire that. But in the end a score is based on how much fun I have (thats why we play right?) and I had very little fun playing Wild Arms XF. This says it all: I cant wait to whip out strategy gems like Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea on my commute...but I had to force myself to drag out XF.
The Sinking City,PlayStation 4,Jun-25-2019,Frogwares,Action Adventure | Survival,GameSpot,30,Its hard to resent a game as unapologetically dweeby as The Sinking City. Its an old-fashioned bookish mystery rooted in the mythology and mysteries of a pulpy cult-favorite mid-century American novelist--an effort not without charm to be sure. But no matter how fond your affection for H.P. Lovecraft and the idea of a wide-eyed slow-burn literary adventure the poor design cliched writing and lumbering pace make this far more tedious than delightful let alone unsettling or terrifying.
Corruption 2029,PC,Feb-17-2020,The Bearded Ladies Consulting,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,The game does not offend but also doesn´t inspire. If it had more original content it would certainly receive a more positive feedback. Therefore it is only an average game. [Issue#302]
Urban Trial Freestyle,3DS,Jun-27-2013,Strangelands Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Driving | Racing | General | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,DarkStation,20,I really enjoyed the previous versions of this game but the 3DS version is sadly just not worth anyone’s time.
The Legend of Korra,PC,Oct-21-2014,PlatinumGames,Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,CD-Action,60,Without Activision at the helm and its policy on licensed games – done too quickly and too cheap – it could have been an epic adventure. [01/2015 p.80]
Pressure,PC,Mar-26-2013,Chasing Carrots,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,4Players.de,50,The steampunk approach in track and vehicle design is charming but mechanics lack variety and most of all tight controls regardless if you enter the course with a gamepad keyboard or mouse at your disposal.
Dragon Age II: Legacy,Xbox 360,Jul-26-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Action RPG,Eurogamer,50,A passable addition to the game but one that doesnt do anything to make itself essential. Better than a lot of BioWare DLC packs but nowhere near as satisfying as their best work.
MXGP Pro,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Push Square,30,Saying that Milestone need to take a step back with its dirt bike games and rework everything is becoming as tired a statement as saying Telltale needs to use a new engine. But it remains true yet again with MXGP Pro. A very slight improvement over MXGP 3 but a noticeable step back from Monster Energy Supercross MXGP Pro is largely a spectacular disaster. It gets a couple things right and offers a new slate of tracks to race on but you’ll be too busy slamming your head into a wall to really notice.
Chasing Aurora,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Broken Rules,Action | General | Flight | Flight,Everyeye.it,45,Chasing Aurora is a Competitive Party Game that does not work. The weakness of the gameplay structure and a not involving single player made every effort useful. A bad game to stay away from.
Deadcore,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2017,Grip Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,TheSixthAxis,30,Challenge fiends may still have a good time with DeadCore although in its current state I would be reluctant to recommend the console port over the PC version – if you have one. Originally a project by a fledgling group of five young French developers DeadCore shows some promise as a platforming first title: the basic mechanics are generally good and fun to use. It’s a shame the game is entirely let down by poor controls and sometimes cheap challenge design both of which are at odds with the game’s speedrunning ethos.
Sonic Heroes,PlayStation 2,Jan-27-2004,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,NTSC-uk,30,Its tricks are old and it offers no challenge but for the irksome nuisances of its design. [JPN Import]
Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness,GameCube,Sep-11-2002,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,IGN,53,Its just a game concept that wears off quickly.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PlayStation,Nov-15-2001,Argonaut Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,40,A lesson in boredom. Without a jump command the platforming elements are all but wasted while the spell-flinging portions of the game are equally forgettable.
Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open,Xbox,Nov-14-2001,Rockstar San Diego,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,All Game Guide,40,All of the problems the off-road games have experienced in the past are as visible in this version as a Hummer with its high beams on.
4x4 Evolution,PlayStation 2,Feb-26-2001,Terminal Reality,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,All Game Guide,40,The racing environments suffer from the PlayStation 2s notorious texture limitations.
Gunbird 2,Dreamcast,Nov-17-2000,Psikyo,Action | General,Daily Radar,0,All flash and no substance Gunbird 2 is too hard too short and too boring to even bother looking at.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD Ver.,PlayStation 3,Aug-21-2012,Capcom,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Game Revolution,40,There are isolated moments of the funny and interesting like one of the 26 fighters being a small dog (I think its a chihuahua but Im not entirely sure). It makes me feel like a bad person but kicking a possessed dog is mildly amusing… the first time. Then it becomes another cheap and frustrating match with the AI.
Sid Meier's Pirates!,Wii,Sep-28-2010,Virtuos,Strategy | General | General,GameZone,35,Sid Meiers Pirates! is another perfect example of a great game gone bad when its poorly ported to consoles. Skip Sid Meiers Pirates; unless you are a glutton for punishment.
SimCity,PC,Mar-5-2013,Maxis,Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,Quarter to Three,20,If Electronic Arts is going to make a game with the basic premise being that no city is an island if theyre going to stress the interaction among cities if theyre going to make playing alongside other people a cornerstone of the design if theyre going to force my creations into tiny boxes that cannot exist past a certain point without the help of other tiny boxes theyre going to have to do the hard work of making it actually work. And ideally that hard work should be done before they sell people the game not after theyve been caught flat-footed for botching it so completely.
Gods Will Be Watching,PC,Jul-24-2014,Devolver Digital,Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,Riot Pixels,35,In 2013 Deconstructeam entered a Ludum Dare competition with a bare bones concept of a game. Now a year later this game has a price tag but it’s bare just as it was back then.
Planet of the Eyes,Xbox One,Sep-12-2017,Coco Cucumber | Cococucumber,Action | Platformer | 2D,XBLA Fans,40,Planet of the Eyes is a surprisingly short game clocking in at around an hour and a half. The game just doesnt have the level of polish that allows such a length to be excusable. Its an incredibly simplistic take on gameplay and narrative ideas weve all seen a million times before never doing anything new or memorable. Even at its best it amounts to little more than a bland experience one that will be over quickly and easily forgotten.
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,PC,Oct-3-2012,Arkedo Studio,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,IGN,49,There are good ideas but thats not enough.
Of Orcs and Men,Xbox 360,Oct-24-2012,Cyanide | Spiders,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG | Western-Style,GameOver.gr,40,You could say that Of Orcs and Men reminds us of games of the distant past but we cant remember RPGs of the old days being so bad. Despite its surprisingly fun and interesting story Of Orcs and Men is a game that struggles and fails to achieve mediocrity.
The Lord of the Rings: Tactics,PSP,Nov-8-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,Computer Games Magazine,30,Its a short vacuous game thats over quickly and even more quickly forgotten. [Feb 2006 p.93]
Musashi: Samurai Legend,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Computer and Video Games,30,Theres a smattering of good ideas in Samurai Legend but theyre quickly crushed under the obesity of mindless combat and poor design. One to avoid. [PSW]
SpongeBob Squigglepants 3D,3DS,May-17-2011,WayForward,Miscellaneous | General | General,Gamekult,40,Quotation forthcoming.
Restaurant Empire II,PC,May-26-2009,Enlight Software,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,You can admire the complexity and new ideas in Restaurant Empire 2 like cafés or patisseries but you can’t deny the confusing controls and the fact it soon gets repetitive and boring. [Aug 2009]
Disney*Pixar WALL-E,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Heavy Iron Studios | Savage Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Gaming Age,33,For the handhelds the PSP version resembles the home console titles for the most part but with the worst visuals of the bunch. The controls also feel completely off and the entire game is more frustrating to play than the other titles.
Hardwood Hearts,Xbox 360,Dec-8-2005,Silver Creek Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Board / Card Game | Gambling,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,No attempt at making its single-player outing more interesting than exhibition matches also stinks. [Issue#23 p.97]
SIMULACRA,Switch,Dec-3-2019,Kaigan Games OU,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,Screen Rant,50,Simulacra is a horror game about investigating a missing girls cellphone that has moments of brilliance but doesnt quite live up to its concept.
Snooker 19,PlayStation 4,Apr-16-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Gamer.nl,60,Snooker 19 does the absolute minimum of what you may expect from a snooker game. Playing snooker is fun but as a package this game is a let-down.
The Council - Episode 5: Checkmate,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,Jeuxvideo.com,55,This final chapter of The Council shines in its art design and provides a great way to take sides in the final intrigue. Unfortunately the ending is expeditive and a bit disappointing. Moreover the game still having some problems with animations lips sync and framerate.
Grand Ages: Medieval,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2015,Gaming Minds Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Riot Pixels,30,In an attempt to please all kinds of strategy players by adding city building trading and wars Grand Ages: Medieval miserably fails on all accounts.
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Metro GameCentral,50,The official World Rally Championship game is looking tired on just its second outing with very few improvements to the first game and far too many flaws.
Alien Breed 3: Descent,PC,Nov-17-2010,Team17,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IncGamers,27,Wedged between survival horror and arcade shooter - but succeeding at neither - Descent is a poorly designed camera-hampered end to an already weak trilogy.
Kholat,PC,Jun-9-2015,IMGN.PRO,Fantasy | Adventure | 3D | First-Person,GameSpot,40,Its ideas reveal the game Kholat wanted to be but its aspirations soar far higher than the game it became. What good is a mystery if you dont care about what it might tell you?
Sid Meier's Starships,PC,Mar-12-2015,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Riot Pixels,25,This awful strategy game is not worthy of even a single playthrough neither on PC nor on tablets.
Infliction: Extended Cut,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2020,Caustic Reality,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,The Digital Fix,40,Infliction: Extended Cut derives almost all of its best ideas from much better games making the whole thing feel like a chore rather than an ordeal. It simply does not cut it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,PC,Jun-30-2009,EA Bright Light,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Format,46,At times it feels like Dead Ringers the Game with a load of people doing not-quite accurate impressions while looking rather unlike the real actors. [Sept 2009 p.98]
Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species,PC,Oct-19-2005,Blue Fang Games,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gaming Horizon,49,It’s a CD that adds about 20 endangered animals to your existing game of Zoo Tycoon 2 and that’s about it.
Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight,PlayStation 4,Jul-7-2017,Artdink,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameOver.gr,30,Accel World Vs. Sword Art Online besides being addressed to a very limited audience comes with many problems (technical and design-wise) which means that even hardcore fans of the two franchises will be discouraged by the problematic nature of the title.
Star Soldier R,Wii,May-19-2008,Hudson Soft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Gamervision,40,While Star Soldier isnt the deepest most nuanced game available it has some pretty tight shooting and fast-paced game play. If youre that second type of gamer who just has to have the highest score you may find 8 dollars worth of game play. Otherwise save yourself some money and finger pain.
Yosumin! LIVE,Xbox 360,May-27-2009,Square Enix,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,GameSpot,55,This color-matching game is too random and shallow to entertain for long.
SingStar ABBA,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2008,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,IGN,55,I love SingStar but feel these artist-specific titles are missteps. Theres not enough content for the price; the scope is super-limited; and even if you love ABBA youll need ABBA-obsessed friends to have a decent party with this title.
Call of Duty: Roads to Victory,PSP,Mar-13-2007,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GameShark,33,Doesnt feel like a true Call of Duty game. Gamers can blame Amaze if they like or the difficulty of developing a shooter on the PSP format but either way Call of Duty Roads to Victory falls short of expectations.
Wheelman,Xbox 360,Mar-24-2009,Tigon | Midway Studios - Newcastle,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Game Revolution,25,It’s like an ironic mustache or mullet. Like having a Steven Segal DVD in your collection. You’ll never get any real use out of it. You just have it in with your other games to show you friends you have a sense of humor.
Wavey The Rocket,PC,May-7-2020,UpperRoom Games Ltd,Action | General,PC Games,40,Quotation forthcoming.
Danger Zone,PlayStation 4,May-30-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Age,33,I have no doubt that in some alternate universe Danger Zone is absolutely awesome. After all it has a good idea at its core and its development team has shown in the past that theyre capable of pulling off that very same idea. In this universe however theres no getting around the fact that Danger Zone is quite simply terrible.
Redeemer,PC,Aug-1-2017,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,Riot Pixels,36,Awful game design meets nonsensical story. Oh and rivers of blood.
STRAFE,PC,May-9-2017,Pixel Titans,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PLAY! Zine,30,STRAFE is a roguelike FPS that tries too hard to remind us of the good old times but since it lacks any depth and quality it fails hard on every level. The game is a mix of horrible graphics (although that was the excuse for the XX century feel) awful story (again on purpose) one of the worst AI opponents ever and questionable shooting.
Townsmen: A Kingdom Rebuilt,Switch,Nov-9-2018,HandyGames,Strategy | General | Management | Government,Switch Player,50,With a simple but competent art style Townsmen delivers a town-building simulation experience akin to classic RTSs such as Age of Empires. Less focused on combat but a bit repetitive it compensates some of its problem with a huge amount of content.
The Town of Light,PC,Feb-26-2016,LKA,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,CD-Action,35,The Town of Light reminded me of similarly short and unpleasant Neverending Nightmares. Both games tried to tackle the subject of mental illnesses and both failed utterly. [07/2016 p.51]
X-Men: The Arcade Game,PlayStation 3,Dec-14-2010,Konami,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Storms thunderthighs remain strangely alluring though. [Apr 2011 p.118]
Van Helsing,PlayStation 2,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Game Revolution,33,Rather than complement the film with some sort of stand alone side story it opts for arcade gameplay sans interesting plot depth or really anything beyond just blasting and whacking.
Mace Griffin Bounty Hunter,Xbox,Jun-20-2003,Warthog,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Eurogamer,40,For all it brings to the table - space combat Halos shield varied levels - not one single aspect is truly worthy of praise.
Global Touring Challenge: Africa,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2002,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,50,It is without a shadow of a doubt the perfect example of the most mediocre racing game Ive ever seen. [July 2002 p.100]
WWE WrestleMania X8,GameCube,Jun-9-2002,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Gamer's Pulse,30,Lacks any great game modes the controls are wacky at times the AI needs some major work and the name just doesn’t fit.
Forever Kingdom,PlayStation 2,Jan-21-2002,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,The multiple-character combos are a nice touch but the execution is so poor as to make it a moot point. [Feb 2002 p.106]
Floigan Bros. Episode 1,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2001,Visual Concepts,Action | General,Electronic Gaming Monthly,17,We’re talking gameplay that swings wildly from being overly simplistic (with brain teasers that couldn’t tease a 1-year-old) to being frustratingly directionless and unintuitive. [Sept 2001 p.145]
Gradius III and IV,PlayStation 2,Nov-13-2000,KCET,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Spank!,30,A complete and utter waste of time and money for anyone who isnt a die-hard shoot em-up junky.
We Happy Few,Xbox One,Aug-10-2018,Compulsion Games,Action Adventure | General,Metro GameCentral,40,A joyless and confused mix of BioShock Fallout and Rust that wastes its intriguing setting on repetitive action and tedious survival mechanics.
Micro Machines V4,PlayStation 2,Jun-27-2006,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,This was a great game...15 years ago. The new Micro Machines fails to offer anything new or exciting to an already stale series. [Sept 2006 p.79]
Legend of Kay Anniversary,PC,Jul-27-2015,Neon Studios | Kaiko,Action Adventure | General | Linear,Metro GameCentral,50,The most peculiar HD remaster so far that offers no obvious reason for its existence or why the original was though worthy of resurrection.
Major League Baseball 2K9,Xbox 360,Mar-3-2009,2K Sports,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Gaming Nexus,33,2k Sports swings for the fences but ultimately drops the ball.
Party Hard,PC,Aug-25-2015,Pinokl Games,Action | General,GameCritics,20,Party Hard is not a game that rewards players who take chances or attempt to learn the layout of levels since the developers randomize the stages after each failure. Trap elements items and victim gathering points change every time. Theres no value in practicing techniques when theres no guarantee players will have a chance to use them.
BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II,3DS,May-31-2011,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,GameShark,25,Likewise I wouldnt touch this game again over the higher quality Capcom and Tecmo offerings available on the same platform. Id advise other push-button martial artists to do the same.
Disgaea Infinite,PSP,Jun-8-2010,Nippon Ichi Software,Adventure | General | General | Visual Novel,Game Revolution,50,The only thing infinite about this game is how often it feels like youre running through the same situations and scenarios.
RiME,Switch,Nov-14-2017,Tantalus | Tequila Works,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,The Games Machine,40,RiME is still a wonderful game but the Switch version is a tremendous porting that can seriously ruin an otherwise unforgettable experience. You can overlook the downgrade of the resolution or even the lower graphic detail but the palette is faded the pop-in is terrible the frame rate unstable and all these combined can seriously discourage everyone.
Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix,Switch,Nov-8-2018,RideonJapan |Inc.,Action | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,RPG Site,50,There’s not much to engage the player here--almost everything about the game is completely average. I wouldn’t say Mercenaries Wings is a bad game it’s simply difficult to recommend spending your time playing it when there other more polished games. If you’re an SRPG nut that’s starved for new games then Mercenaries Wings might be the game you’re looking for but otherwise I’d spend your time elsewhere.
Batman: The Telltale Series,PC,Aug-2-2016,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,GamesRadar+,40,Batman: The Telltale Series squanders its potential with a messy story obsessed with retreading older Batman tales.
Alien Breed,PlayStation Vita,Feb-12-2013,Team17,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gamers\' Temple,40,Some things get better with age but Alien Breed is not one of them.
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight,PC,Mar-16-2010,EA LA,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Game Revolution,25,Command & Conquer 4 is atrocious end of story.
The Saga of Ryzom,PC,Sep-20-2004,Nevrax,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Computer Games Magazine,40,For a game with such amazing art direction innovative game ideas and a dedicated developer its a shame that it pimps you down unfairly and destroys your entertainment with double-digit deaths. [Feb 2005 p.69]
Mad Riders,Xbox 360,May-30-2012,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Games.cz,40,Mad Riders is an arcade racing game that is boring to death. Even though the game offers plenty of tracks modes and vehicles the actual differences are in their different colours. Quantity dominates quality and most importantly - it dominates the actual entertainment.
Need for Speed Undercover,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2008,EA Vancouver,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Game Revolution,16,Unfinished underdeveloped racing efforts like Need for Speed: Undercover leave the acrid taste of stale engine oil and greasy do-rags in my mouth. Luckily it’s nothing that a little time spent with Grid or PGR4 can’t wash away. Undercover attempts to return the series to its former glory but it’s obviously lost that loving feeling.
Warframe,PlayStation 4,Nov-12-2013,Digital Extremes,General | General | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Eurogamer,40,Its hard though to shake the feeling that the only reason this game is free to play is that nobody would pay money for something so scrappy and generic.
Ghostbusters: The Video Game,PlayStation 2,Jun-16-2009,War Drum Studios,Action | General,Gamer.nl,30,This version of Ghostbusters is a poor port of the Wii version with a plethora of technical and gameplay issues. Fans are better off picking up the game on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3.
Phantasy Star Universe,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2006,Sonic Team,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Boomtown,40,There’s just nothing there to recommend beyond a reasonably decent plot. Best thing I can suggest then is to find a detailed guide somewhere online and read the story there – you’ll have more fun and won’t waste time and money on the game.
Armored Core: For Answer,Xbox 360,Sep-16-2008,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,We accept that there’s some who’ll like this. You know who you are and you know you’re not the majority. Listen up majority it is you to whom we speak.
The friends of Ringo Ishikawa,Switch,Apr-3-2019,yeo,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Destructoid,50,The combat too can get a little confusing when a bunch of characters are on-screen. Youll end up hitting the wrong foe which then allows your intended target to get some free hits on you. The abundance of techniques doesnt add much either as the basic punch and kick combos do fine against everyone. I know this isnt meant to be specifically a beat-em-up but the gameplay feels a little basic.
Seasons After Fall,PlayStation 4,May-16-2017,Swing Swing Submarine,Action | Platformer | 2D,Destructoid,40,To put it bluntly Seasons After Fall is pleasant. A world with a great feeling experience that tends to knock you out of it when moving around. As much as I appreciate a game as relaxed as this that relaxation never quite became true enjoyment.
The Baconing,Xbox 360,Aug-31-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Action RPG | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Armchair Empire,35,The Baconing isnt completely devoid of enjoyment; occasionally you may stumble upon a fun weapon or two such as poison arrows or a flamethrower and the experience system allows you to choose what kind of bonuses to receive with each Level Up (such as faster speed more health etc). But without the laughs to back up the mediocre gameplay not to mention the ludicrous difficulty it might be time to bring out the oversized shepherds hook and pull Deathspank off the stage.
Vikings: Wolves of Midgard,Xbox One,Mar-28-2017,Games Farm,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GamingTrend,50,As unmemorable as it was disappointing Vikings—Wolves of Midgard misses the mark. With a flat story uninteresting combat made worse by the game’s annoying exposure system and a boring environment to boot this title doesn’t compare to its many well-liked peers within the ARPG genre.
NASCAR: The Game 2013,PC,Jul-24-2013,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,Thunderbolt,30,For some it may be enough to simply have a new Nascar experience but as a game it’s not going to hold an appeal for anyone beyond those who simply want a straightforward replication of the sport.
N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure,Xbox One,May-15-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Miscellaneous | Adventure | Puzzle | General | 3D | First-Person,EGM,35,A few interesting puzzles can’t save Nero from being an overwritten mawkish plod that runs so poorly on the Xbox One it’s tough to play without feeling sick.
Sea of Solitude,PC,Jul-5-2019,Electronic Arts | Jo-Mei Games,General | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Quarter to Three,20,I don’t mean to make light of someone who’s obviously — maybe too obviously — writing about things that make her sad. I get it. But being sad doesn’t make your poetry worth reading. I’m sorry I know that’s a dick thing to say but I’m not your therapist. I’m not even your friend. I don’t know you.
Kholat,PlayStation 4,Mar-8-2016,IMGN.PRO,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,God is a Geek,40,Grievously weighed down by its unforgiving orienteering mechanic tedious gameplay and frame-rate issues Kholat is more likely to leave you with your head aching rather than your head spinning.
The Crew,Xbox One,Dec-2-2014,Ubisoft Reflections | Ivory Tower,GT / Street | Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | Automobile,We Got This Covered,40,From the absurd handling and cheap enemy A.I. to the ugly graphics and over-reliance on microtransactions there are no shortage of problems here. Even if you are desperate for a new racer (I’m looking at you PS4 owners) I can’t justify recommending this game in its current state.
Tiger Woods PGA Tour,DS,Dec-14-2004,Sensory Sweep,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Sim | Sim,Pocket Games,30,EA tries to innovate with their first DS golf game the end result is double bogey with a penalty shot. [Spring 2005 p.63]
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamers Europe,35,It has a fantastic score an excellent cast and some genuinely good ideas but its inability to find balance between narration and game along with poor execution means that this is one purple headed monster you won’t want to be playing with.
Academy of Champions: Soccer,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,Nintendo Gamer,36,Worse than Peles impotence advert. [Dec 2009 p.67]
Moons of Madness,Xbox One,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,Windows Central,40,Lovecraft fans will have to look elsewhere. While Moons of Madness has some exciting ideas and goes a long way on its premise alone the story is too dense and the gameplay is too simple to make it worth your time... unless you need to kill five hours.
Sleep Tight,Switch,Jul-26-2018,We Are Fuzzy,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,TheSixthAxis,40,Sleep Tight has some very interesting ideas but unfortunately fails to captilise on them and falls into the depths of mediocrity.
Disney/Pixar Ratatouille,PSP,Jun-26-2007,Locomotive Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,1UP,50,Ratatouille is otherwise a very charming game...when youre not playing it. Its biggest failings are in the end the built-in limitations of the hardware and the genre that most developers keep trying to superimpose -- sloppily -- on top of it.
Batman Begins,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2005,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Computer Games Magazine,30,Youve basically got a barely interactive Splinter Cell for Dummies. [Sept 2005 p.91]
Carve,Xbox,Feb-24-2004,Argonaut Games,Driving | Racing | Snow / Water,TotalGames.net,40,Its a great shame but playing Carve is like playing Paint Dry Simulator on Xbox... all the wall textures are there the gloss of the emulsion - you can even see the brush strokes in the drying paint - it just doesnt add up to a hell of a lot of fun.
Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction,Xbox,Jul-30-2003,Zono Inc.,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi,Yahoo!,40,The game mechanics are so badly crippled that it probably doesnt even deserve to be called a strategy game.
X-Squad,PlayStation 2,Oct-23-2000,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GamePen,40,Its merely a re-run of countless action games that have come before it: a futuristic setting with lots of weapons shooting and running around... but not much after that.
Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault,PlayStation 3,Nov-27-2012,Insomniac Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,EGM,45,Aside from some moments of classic Ratchet & Clank humor Full Frontal Assault fails both as a tower defense game and as a means to hold fans of the franchise over until Insomniac delivers a new mainline title.
Yakuza: Dead Souls,PlayStation 3,Mar-13-2012,Ryu ga Gotoku Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Gaming Age,42,I dont feel like Yakuza: Dead Souls is a game that anyone really needs to play even if youre a pretty hardcore fan of the series. The action is such a departure from the series and handled so poorly that it literally turns you off of wanting to do anything but the non-combat side stuff found throughout.
ADR1FT,PC,Mar-28-2016,Three One Zero,Action | Action Adventure | General | Survival,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Visually beautiful trip to the ruined space station which unfortunately gets boring soon. You won´t be killed by lack of oxygen but mainly by boredom and frustration from the lack of content. [Issue#263]
Chaos Wars,PlayStation 2,May-30-2008,Idea Factory,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),40,Chaos Wars might draw in some--like fans of the obscure games its based on especially those who long for the days of hand-drawn characters and tiny battlefields--but its old-school aesthetic isnt enough to make up for the lackluster production values and uninspired game play. [Aug 2008 p.82]
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III,PC,May-22-2015,NeocoreGames,Role-Playing | Action RPG,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,It should be labeled: only for core fans. Third installment of Van Helsing is not entirely bad but it’s average and completely misses its mark..
Super Lucky's Tale,Xbox One,Nov-7-2017,Playful Corp.,2D | Action | Platformer | 3D,Metro GameCentral,30,Bland boring and badly made – returning to the bad old days of low rent mascot platformers is not a good way to demonstrate the power of the Xbox One X.
Cold War,PC,Sep-27-2005,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Computer Games Magazine,40,Silly balking chuckle-inducing for the wrong reasons Cold War is the sort of pretender-to-stealth-throne that makes you squint pinch your nose and wave your hand rapidly in front of your face.[Feb 2006 p.59]
Snooker 19,Switch,Aug-23-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Pure Nintendo,40,If you want to be able to play a fully-licensed snooker game anywhere and at any time on your Nintendo Switch then this would be a suitable option albeit a boring one. If you aren’t in need of portable snooker-gameplay then you are probably better off going to your local bowling alley and/or sports bar.
Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs. Sasuke,DS,Nov-12-2010,Takara Tomy,Action | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Nexus,42,Theres nothing broken about Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs Sasuke but there isnt anything to make it stand out in a crowd either. Youre better off getting your ninja fix elsewhere.
Officers,PC,Jul-14-2009,3A Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,GameSpot,55,Officers boasts some interesting strategic considerations including a focus on reconnaissance and realistic supply concerns which have been lacking in recent RTS games. However the practically nonexistent multiplayer the punishing difficulty the exhaustingly long missions and a few other annoyances make it a difficult game to recommend.
Zombie Driver HD,Xbox 360,Oct-17-2012,EXOR Studios,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,56,Its potential is never fully realised. [Jan 2013 p.79]
Crash Twinsanity,PlayStation 2,Sep-28-2004,Traveller's Tales,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamestyle,30,Full completion of the game takes time and whilst there are some nice extras on the DVD to unlock you cant get around the fact that its time that could be spent doing something far far better.
MX vs. ATV All Out: Anniversary Edition,Xbox One,Feb-26-2019,THQ Nordic,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,GameGrin,55,Unless you’re a huge huge fan of the series then I wouldnt go all out on this one as the developers certainly didn’t.
Darksiders III,PlayStation 4,Nov-27-2018,Gunfire Games | THQ Nordic,Action Adventure | Open-World,Game Rant,20,The game is a nightmare to play through with an unlikable protagonist a chugging frame rate and a mountain of bugs. It’s completely and utterly broken but even when it works (which is almost never) it amounts to nothing more than a below average hack-and-slash with some decent puzzles.
RymdResa,PC,Aug-20-2015,Morgondag,Role-Playing | General,Digitally Downloaded,50,With time and patches this could be a must play but as it is I can only cautiously recommend RymdResa as a game with fascinating ideas and inconsistent execution.
Hydrophobia: Prophecy,PC,May-9-2011,Dark Energy Digital,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,PC Gamer,39,Hydrophobia Prophecy suffers from more than a fear of water: Its also afflicted with acute blandness brain dead AI and chronic backtracking. [Sept 2011 p.73]
Intellivision Lives!,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2003,Realtime Associates,Miscellaneous | Compilation,G4 TV,40,The game tries to adapt the various keypad functions and you can use an on-screen virtual Intellivision paddle but neither works as well as the original hardwired controllers did.
Worms: Open Warfare,DS,Mar-22-2006,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Artillery,PALGN,40,Ultimately Worms: Open Warfare feels really undercooked. Everybody knows that there’s potential for a good Worms game on the DS – you’ve got the Wi-Fi online play stylus allowing for mouse-like precision and all of that jazz but Open Warfare doesn’t exactly make good use of any of these features. Regardless of that the biggest insult is that the title can’t even hold up against its ageing predecessors – it really feels like the product was slapped together and shipped out as cheaply as possible.
Storm,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,EKO Software,Miscellaneous | General | General,Games Master UK,44,An extreme exercise in patience. [Sept 2013 p.71]
TNA iMPACT!,PlayStation 3,Sep-9-2008,Midway Studios - Los Angeles,Action | Sports | Fighting | Fighting | Individual | Wrestling | Combat | Wrestling,GameShark,33,Remember when Blitz and NBA Jam ruled supreme and we all got our first taste of the notorious Midway Comeback AI? I’m sad to say that a close relative of that AI seems to be present here.
RPG Maker Fes,3DS,Jun-27-2017,Jupiter Corporation | Kadokawa,Role-Playing | General,NintendoWorldReport,50,Ultimately it’s hard for me to recommend RPG Maker Fes to anyone but the most hardcore of RPG fans that have always dreamed of creating their own game. You’ll certainly be limited by the tools (or lack thereof) available here and the lack of a meaningful tutorial may hinder all but the most patient of designers. RPG Maker Fes feels like an incomplete product like a beginner sewer’s kit that was shipped with only one color of thread and without instructions. You can definitely make an RPG if you’re patient enough but it’s unlikely to come close to what you envisioned when you began which is likely to leave you unsatisfied.
nail'd,Xbox 360,Nov-30-2010,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,games(TM),30,Theres nothing in Naild that is outright offensive but the sloppiness of its execution damn-near eradicates any fun that could have been gleaned from it. [Issue#105 p.122]
Killer Is Dead,PlayStation 3,Aug-27-2013,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameCritics,40,Between the tedious levels incoherent story and offputting gigolo missions I found very little to appreciate about Killer is Dead. I grew quite tired of the shallow game design and weak attempts to distract me from its vacuous lack of substance and put the game down before rolling credits.
Arc Rise Fantasia,Wii,Jul-27-2010,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,The A.V. Club,42,When the reward for beating the next boss is just more bland gameplay it just isnt worth the effort.
Exit DS,DS,Nov-5-2008,Moss,Action | Puzzle | General | General,Modojo,40,With over 100 levels and Wi-Fi functionality via leaderboards Exit DS isnt totally without merit.
Track Lab,PlayStation 4,Aug-21-2018,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,PlayStation LifeStyle,40,If you want a game there are better music puzzlers out there with heaps more content and if you’re looking for someplace to fire up your musical chops there are actual music production tools that will serve you in better ways than Track Lab’s isolated creation mode.
Rainbow Skies,PlayStation 4,Jun-26-2018,SideQuest Studios,Role-Playing | General,Cubed3,40,Rainbow Skies is not only uninspired it feels almost like a cheap nostalgia cash-in for JRPG enthusiasts. The characters are generally annoying and mostly one-dimensional and the writing is quite poor and riddled with syntax issues. The explorative nature of the game is something that players might be drawn to but thats not enough to carry the significantly weaker portions of the game. The combat system is sort of cute in its simplicity but its not unique enough to keep players invested throughout all the annoying little quirks that fill up the majority of Rainbow Skies
King Oddball,Xbox One,Sep-9-2016,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Action,XBLA Fans,40,This game can be fun but not for long periods of time. It is more likely a game you would buy play once then forget about until you are looking through your game library because you ran out of storage. Ive said this before and I will say it again: puzzle games should require patience and skill rather than focus on speed and luck. King Oddballs enormous amount of levels and chuckle-worthy achievements just dont cut it.
Thor: God of Thunder,DS,May-3-2011,WayForward,Action | General | General,Game Revolution,42,Tacked-on touch screen support.
Cranium Kabookii,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Cheat Code Central,52,As a video game Cranium Kabookii offers an experience that cant even match that of its low-tech predecessor. The poor control and repetitive gameplay coupled with the underwhelming graphics and sound make for an experience thats better left off of the video game console and back on to your familys dining-room table.
Star Trek: Tactical Assault,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,Its not as bad as most Trek titles but TA fails to boldly go where no game has gone before. [Jan 2007 p.92]
Avatar: The Last Airbender,DS,Oct-10-2006,TOSE,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,57,The Avatars DS debut serves up an engaging story and some slick 3D visuals but its otherwise just another mediocre brawler.
Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue,GameCube,Aug-16-2005,Xpec,Action Adventure | Fantasy,G4 TV,40,If you cant go anywhere without your Chococat pencil case go ahead and pick up Roller Rescue. Were sure youll manage to delude yourself into thinking its great.
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,PC,Nov-10-2004,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Computer Games Magazine,50,The sort of game that screams average! at every turn. [March 2005 p.83]
Wrath Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Feb-10-2004,Double Helix Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,Too simple for strategy fans and too complex for fighting fans. The occasionally interesting creature design and accompanying animation cant save this one from its cliched premise uninteresting gameplay and interminable load times. [Mar 2004 p.103]
RoadKill,GameCube,Oct-30-2003,Terminal Reality,Driving | Car Combat,Nintendo Power,26,A mediocre mess of a vehicular battle game that contains an excessive amount of violence and strong language. [Feb 2004 p.150]
Pro Rally,GameCube,Nov-11-2002,Ubisoft,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,G4 TV,40,Visually the game has a rather muddy and faded look -- it just isnt up to snuff. Although car damage can affect driving none of it shows up in the visuals.
Superman: Shadow of Apokolips,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2002,Atari,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSM Magazine,40,Repetitive missions bad flight controls and too many robots make this game quite non-super. [Dec 2002 p.60]
Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates,Game Boy Advance,Apr-30-2002,RFX Interactive,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Power,56,With fairly typical side-scrolling action the game feels all the more grand thanks to its amazing look and magical settings. [May 2002 p.140]
Wild Wild Racing,PlayStation 2,Oct-25-2000,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Hot Games,50,Its all the worst traits of arcade racers thrown together exaggerated to the point of grotesqueness and then slapped into a game thats at best a visual mixed bag.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood,PlayStation 4,Jul-26-2019,MachineGames,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Gaming Age,16,At $30 I expected a short but dense Wolfenstein experience with two new protagonists and a tangible narrative thread connecting them to the original games their father B.J. Blazkowicz. What we got was a horrible imitation of the rest of the series complete with an absolutely senseless plot unacceptably bad and annoying characters and joyless combat. I find that a weak plot can be forgiven if gameplay is flawless and satisfying and sometimes weaker gameplay can be ignored in favor of an incredible story but you cannot botch BOTH aspects and expect people to like your game.
Juiced,PC,Jun-13-2005,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Computer Games Magazine,50,THQ salvaged the wreckage polished the package and let the game out of hte garage where it debuts with middling success. [Oct 2005 p.68]
The Adventures of Tintin: The Game,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2011,Ubisoft Montpellier,Adventure | General | General,1UP,25,I understand that the game is meant for a younger audience but there are quite literally hundreds of other titles out there that provide a far more enjoyable experience.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,PC,Jun-25-2007,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Boomtown,40,Its a shame really as EA could have done a whole lot better. The control system could be a lot better the animation could be better and the cut-scenes could be better.
Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2011,Vicious Cycle,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Age,33,My suggestion would be to skip this title entirely unless youre particularly hard up for some new EDF action.
Dead Island: Definitive Collection,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,Techland,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,A festering corpse given an unnecessary kiss of life. [Aug 2016 p.93]
The Witch and the Hundred Knight: Revival Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameCritics,30,The Witch and the Hundred Knight isn’t a good game by any means. It has an impenetrable equipment system lackluster combat with no other gameplay mechanics and a story that only gets good if players consult an FAQ.
198X,PC,Jun-20-2019,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,The Indie Game Website,50,198X is aesthetically pleasing. Its bright accomplished pixel-art and synth-fueled music capture its desired tone perfectly. But if that’s all that 198X is I’m not sure it’s worth anyone’s time. Even if you are interested in a pretty but empty 80s nostalgia drip I’d suggest looking elsewhere; there are plenty of options.
The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer,Xbox,Nov-1-2005,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gaming Age,50,While the game doesnt do much in the way of gameplay the presentation makes up for it.
Suikoden IV,PlayStation 2,Jan-11-2005,KCET,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Game Revolution,33,An uninspired unnecessary chapter in the Suikoden series. The game’s greatest failing is its incredible mediocrity.
Supreme Ruler: Cold War,PC,Jul-19-2011,BattleGoat Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Gamekult,50,Quotation forthcoming.
This Is the Police,PlayStation 4,Mar-22-2017,Weappy Studio,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life | Career,GameCritics,40,Overall This Is The Police is a somewhat enjoyable strategy/time management title although the story felt like wasted time since I never grew connected to the characters or the plot and it had no real bearing on play. With more weight given to the plot and better integration into the game overall this sad tale of a man slowly sinking to the bottom would have come together into something fascinating. As it stands the strategic parts can’t save the experience overall and the end result is a title that feels only half-done. Ultimately This is the Police ended up being a game to kill time with not one to lose time on.
Neon Chrome,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Impulsegamer,44,With a time consuming upgrade system and lack of variation in the levels despite the procedural generation Neon Chrome is forgive the obvious pun ultimately neither bright or polished enough.
FIFA Street 2,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Game Revolution,42,Even after a sequel this Street still falls flat on its asphalt.
Fallout 76: Wastelanders,PlayStation 4,Apr-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Metro GameCentral,50,Wastelanders transforms Fallout 76 from a technical and conceptual disaster to a merely flawed online experience which has a far better online community than it deserves.
Super Bomberman R,Xbox One,Jun-12-2018,Konami,Puzzle | Action | Arcade,Digital Chumps,40,Overall I think Super Bomberman R falls short as a complete package. The single-player while reaching for something a bit different with level design (and it achieves it) falls short with uninteresting bosses and slow enemies. The online play of the game is only good on a local level while the actual online gaming experience is hindered by the lack of players and atrocious delay.
Cubemen 2,Wii U,Sep-4-2014,3 Sprockets,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | General | Defense,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,50,If the offline community ever picks up wed expect to slap another 20% on that score. Until then steer clear. [Christmas 2014 p.95]
Necrovision,PC,May-18-2009,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Absolute Games,33,At first NecroVisioN seems like a fun game. But when you realize that the 1237th encounter with monsters is the same as the 561st and that melee is just a polygon mess all the fun goes away.
Worms Forts: Under Siege,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,PSX Extreme,41,The game has so many technical flaws that you simply cannot enjoy the experience.
Dirty Bomb,PC,Jun-1-2015,Splash Damage,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameSpot,50,While Brink sits in history as a game that tripped on its path to fame Dirty Bomb will be fortunate to be remembered at all.
World Poker Tour,Xbox,Oct-18-2005,2K Sports,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,GameSpy,40,All in all WPT is not a bad title but $20 can get you into a couple of real tournaments online. Tournaments where you could actually make money.
Moons of Madness,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,Gameblog.fr,30,If the atmosphere of Moons of Madness is rather well posed successful through its story and its compartmentalized environments borrows paranoia any Lovecraftian in Martian confinement difficult not to go around in circles quickly the fault of a relative monotony in the course disappointing or agreed history and puzzles.
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,LucasArts,Action | General | General,DarkZero,40,The original Force Unleashed shot for the stars and fell short but at least you could commend it for trying. Force Unleashed 2 feels sterile and barren in comparison refusing to try for anything spectacular and managing to reuse and recycle its few good ideas countless times over its short run.
Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom,Xbox One,Apr-28-2017,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object,GameGrin,55,The pros just barely outweigh the cons for me in this puzzle game. Since the puzzles are less than impressive and the animations seem to have taken a step back its only because the addition of the alchemy minigame and the extra easy completion that I would recommend this game. Without a doubt this is one of the most forgettable Artifex Mundi titles.
Resident Evil 6,Xbox One,Mar-29-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,Gaming Age,25,If you are hell bent on grabbing RE6 wait for a price drop. $20 is even too steep in my opinion.
Godzilla: Save the Earth,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Fighting | 3D,G4 TV,40,A decent party game with a great cast of cheesy giant monsters but its just not scaly or radioactive enough to command much respect.
FIFA Street 3,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,G4 TV,40,A sequel isn’t supposed to be softer poorer slower weaker but that sadly sums up FIFA Street 3s questionable content.
Finding Nemo,Xbox,May-9-2003,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,40,Its not very complex or original with little to the action beyond simple objective completion and ABC linearity while more mature players may gag at the cutesiness of it all.
InnerSpace,Switch,Jan-16-2018,PolyKnight Games,Simulation | Flight | Civilian,TheSixthAxis,50,InnerSpace manages to craft a bright bizarre and beautiful world that is probably the best example of the phrase eye candy I can think of. Unfortunately the act of exploring and navigating that serene majestic world often times felt like a headache. The poor frame rate on Switch and no clear horizons made flying and swimming in InnerSpace far less enjoyable than the idea of those actions ever was.
Dragon's Prophet,PC,Aug-13-2013,Runewaker Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy,IGN,51,With dragon taming action combat and robust skill and housing systems theres an enjoyable experience at the core of Dragons Prophet that never manages to break free of the dull environment and grinding pace that surrounds it.
NBA 09 The Inside,PlayStation 3,Oct-7-2008,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Gaming Nexus,33,There are just too many problems with the basic game of basketball in NBA 09 to really recommend this above the other games out there.
Shark Tale,PC,Sep-27-2004,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Computer Games Magazine,30,The biggest problems are the shockingly short play time and repetitive gameplay. [Jan 2005 p.73]
X-Men: Next Dimension,GameCube,Oct-15-2002,Exakt,Action | Fighting | 3D,Play Magazine,40,Besides a real lack of polish on the models and backgrounds in Dimension it just feels mediocre when stacked against competition like DOA Kakuto Chojin and MK Deadly Alliance. [Jan 2003 p.81]
Alpha Protocol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,GameCritics,10,Flawed in its conception impoverished in its design and thoroughly inept in its execution Alpha Protocol is an unmitigated disaster
Spectrobes,DS,Mar-6-2007,Jupiter Corporation,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,netjak,42,While filled with numerous excellent ideas the mish-mash handling of the development destroyed the potential.
PixelJunk 4am,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Q-Games,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Music Maker | Music Maker | Application,Play UK,40,Its a brief distraction and sometimes interesting if you get to watch some kid in Moscow making the most beautiful sounds youve ever heard but that doesnt exactly happen all the time.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India,PlayStation 4,Jan-13-2016,Ubisoft | Climax Studios,General | Action Adventure | Linear,Push Square,50,The dialogue is dull the art style doesnt look good at all and the game just doesnt have much appeal. Its certainly not bad its just so bang average that youll have seen it all before.
Airheart: Tales of Broken Wings,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2018,Blindflug Studios,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameCritics,35,I wanted to like Airheart. The concept of a roguelike with air combat exploring worlds and creating my own plane is a good one. Unfortunately buggy game mechanics lackluster crafting and the awful grind for money shoots this little ship out of the sky.
DarkStar One: Broken Alliance,Xbox 360,Jul-13-2010,Gaming Minds Studios,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,MondoXbox,50,DarkStar One fails in every aspect even if we have to acknowledge it the merit of having introduced some potentially interesting mechanics.
Big Bumpin',Xbox 360,Nov-19-2006,Blitz Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,NTSC-uk,30,Again the game features multiplayer over Live but suffers from very few people playing online and is solely populated by prepubescents with limited vocabularies that consist of nothing but insults.
Citadel: Forged with Fire,Xbox One,Nov-1-2019,Blue Isle Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,God is a Geek,50,There is potentially a fun game underneath but Citadel: Forged with Fire is mired in a relentless time-draining loop of meaningless activity.
Dogos,Xbox One,Sep-7-2016,INTERNET URL S.A.,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Brash Games,50,The gameplay can be as tight as you like but if there’s nothing to inspire me to boot the game back up of an evening well… OPQAM I’m afraid you’re missing the mark.
NBA 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2007,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Gaming Age,33,Sony just let this one go it isn’t worth the embarrassment.
Windlands,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,God is a Geek,50,Windlands is a pretty great idea that could have been an essential PSVR title had more thought been put into its traversal.
Major League Baseball 2K8,Wii,Mar-3-2008,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,1UP,50,MLB 2K8 on the Wii just didnt sparkle enough to make me overly enthusiastic. Its a fun novelty play but Im taking a Cubs fan-style wait till next year approach with what could very well blossom into a must-play by next season.
The World Next Door,Switch,Mar-27-2019,Rose City Games,Action Adventure | General,GamingTrend,50,The World Next Door is an ambitious action-puzzle game with some interesting narrative and RPG elements but unfortunately wears itself thin trying too much with too little.
Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,PlayStation 4,Feb-24-2015,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,The Jimquisition,30,Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is everything a Dynasty Warriors hater thinks about the series made real. It’s a contemptuously assembled recycling project and I’m sick of it.
The Immortals of Terra: A Perry Rhodan Adventure,PC,Jul-3-2008,Braingame,Adventure | 3D | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person,GameShark,25,Like all games based on successful licenses from the written world it’s a shame to see Immortals of Terra struggle so much in terms of overall direction. I’m sure in the vast Perry Rhodan landscape there’s more than enough material to make several blockbuster titles yet this game fails to even make it out of the starting block.
NBA Live 07,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2006,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Sim,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,The heavier focus on animations makes the controls feel sticky - press for a pass a rebound or a block and it might not happen. [Nov 2006 p.103]
Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings,PSP,Jun-9-2009,Amaze Entertainment | Amaze,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,Game Chronicles,52,It seemed more like a collection of exercises or training scenarios rather than a flowing adventure.
Eragon,DS,Nov-14-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Action RPG | General | Fantasy | Beat-'Em-Up | Japanese-Style | 3D,Game Revolution,25,If you’re wondering what it would be like to ride on the back of a giant dragon crushing those who would dare to oppose you go out and rent The Neverending Story. You’ll have a better time than you would playing Eragon.
Sniper Elite III,Xbox One,Jul-1-2014,Rebellion,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic,Pure Xbox,50,Sniper Elite 3 is an average game. The sneaking around hiding scouting and tactical aspects are very enjoyable. But it gets repetitive pretty fast especially when the actual gameplay and the enemies dont really change.
Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines,PSP,Nov-17-2009,Griptonite Games,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,GameShark,25,Simply put there are too many negatives here and too many other excellent action games on the PSP to justify spending time with this jumbled mess. This is one set of memories best left forgotten.
Penny-Punching Princess,Switch,Apr-3-2018,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameCritics,40,I appreciated that Penny-Punching Princess brought some new spins to the action-RPG genre and using money as a tool to fight is a fairly novel idea that could be explored more. The calculator is also a thematically brilliant idea in a game about capitalism and debt. However the combat mechanics are problematic and play falls prey to unnecessary frustration and repetition.
Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche,Switch,Apr-1-2020,WayForward,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,Switch Player,40,Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche originated as a joke but ultimately ends up as a bore. Yes there’s some fun to be found within those two ends of the spectrum but those moments are fleeting and never quite justify your time spent with it.
The Godfather II,PC,Apr-7-2009,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Adventure | Third-Person | Historic | Linear | Open-World | Modern,Absolute Games,38,Establishing a new Family is a hard undertaking… and a tedious chore. Imagine spending 10+ hours on taking over one building after another! In GTA: San Andreas and The Godfather this occupation was but a side attraction; here it is everything.
Bounty Hounds,PSP,Sep-13-2006,Xpec,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamesRadar+,30,With insanely repetitive mindless action and completely unengaging character progression Bounty Hounds withers and dies within its first hour.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,Eurogamer,50,Its competent. Solid. Inoffensive. Somewhere down the line DnS Development got mired in the details and neglected to inject the spark necessary to make the run-and-gun fun.
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,games(TM),60,Lets hope Namco has a patch in the pipeline. [June 2008 p.124]
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Gaming Nexus,65,Infinity Runner does provide a few moments of intense fun. Unfortunately those moments are broken up too often with gameplay choices that really bring the game (and the fun) to a screeching halt.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameZone,58,Unforgiving AI lack of play options to customize your game and the annoying fact that you can’t restart a race during a championship really can make the game more aggravating than enjoyable.
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,PlayStation Country,60,I find Generation Zero to have an interesting stealthy core that sadly is undermined by a somewhat empty world. The technical issues might lead some to hold off and I do hope Avalanche keep supporting this blueprint. There is an appeal to this that does want me to return providing something more is on the horizon.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Next Level Gaming,50,The problem is that they failed at making either the storyline or the action engaging and fun.
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,IGN,45,Mixing a ton of casino games into one package and then tying a goal-based story around it certainly works on paper but when you use low-budget implementations of each and every game to put it together the whole thing falls apart.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GamingXP,65,Generally Hyperdimension Neptunia is certainly not the worst RPG on the PS3. However in order to be included in the major leagues the game lacks a lot.
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,60,Supermassive Games delivers an unimpressive on-rail shooter with some light co-op tactical features.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gameplanet,45,Rodea the Sky Soldier has the odd interesting idea but numerous gameplay problems betray its troubled development.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Next Level Gaming,54,There are better puzzle games out there and games that do not pretend to be something they are not.
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,GameZone,55,Thanks to its many glaring flaws such as awful camera and awkward combat controls Catwoman isn’t much fun to play even with the cool feline abilities.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpy,63,Superempire put in a password save system for EWJ2 but sadly it bites!
Shadow the Hedgehog,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2005,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cheat Code Central,50,Unlike last years popular and more importantly playable Sonic Heroes Shadow The Hedgehog is a misstep in almost every direction.
Crash: Mind Over Mutant,DS,Oct-7-2008,TOSE,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GamingTrend,57,I understand that Crash: Mind Over Mutant is good on the consoles. Not great but good. It seems that a little more time and effort could have gone into the DS version and it makes me sad.
Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpot,55,This arcade game is relatively shallow and a pale imitation of its television inspiration.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Hardcore Gamer,60,Fans have waited a long time for Rodea the Sky Soldier but unfortunately the final experience never comes within range of Yuji Naka’s past masterpieces.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,GameFocus,59,Warriors: Legends of Troy is a nice change of pace from other Warrior-type games published by Tecmo-Koei. Unfortunately it still is hampered by a lot of problems.
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,TeamXbox,65,A decent physics and handling model not to mention a solid damage model.
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamerNode,55,The concept is intriguing and the game worlds can be very immersive but the execution in Darkest of Days falls short of its potential amid control AI and other gameplay issues.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer.no,60,This is pretty much a low-budget version of Gears of War but enjoyable enough for what it is. Only buy if you can play in coop mode with real human beings though because the AI of your squad mates is just dreadful.
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Da Gameboyz,65,On the one hand the bare bones of the game are there the potential is there and I wouldnt trust many devs outside of Kerberos to patch this to a decent state. On the other regardless its going to take at least a few months to patch it to a state where its not just sort of playable its actually enjoyable. But if you feel like helping nurture a game to completion by all means fork out. Those of you who are more cautious hang back a few months it should be cool by then.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,53,The forced or rushed feeling of this title just weighs too heavy on me. And with the lacking graphics and clunky gameplay this title just fails on all levels.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Meristation,50,Watchmen: The end is Nigh Part 2 is essentially the same game. Three new levels but the same characters the same moves and the same price. Not worth on its own better on the retail disc version along with Part 1.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,JeuxActu,50,Completed in under 5 hours with sloppy gameplay and no challenge whatsoever Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan looks more like a merchandising product for the movie than a real thought-out game.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameBiz,54,The game falls short most obviously in the gameplay with its bland and linear levels and large amount of backtracking used only as an attempt to make the game longer although it’s still only around five hours long.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,TotalGames.net,50,A dreadfully wasted opportunity - especially when it looks so good.
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,Sports Gaming Network,60,NHN isnt terrible but it isnt close to being a great game either. Casual hockey fans shouldnt bother with National Hockey Night and for the hardcore hockey fan this game is a rental at best.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameFocus,58,Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part 2 (and Part 1) could only be enjoyed by fans of either the book or movie. I don’t see how someone who isn’t remotely knowledgeable of Watchmen could enjoy these games especially Part 2.
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Cheat Code Central,46,If Hummer Badlands were an actual arcade game it would make on average about a quarter an hour. Its just too easy.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Gamezilla!,50,Its just passable really but I dont think Master Splinter would approve wholeheartedly even with a decent price point of $20.
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GameZone,60,Theres not much more to say. Pass on this one unless you are the most hardcore of RPG players. Even then stop and reassess if youre really sure about this. Maybe go for a walk and clear your head. If youre still determined have at it. You are one of the special few.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Multiplayer.it,50,Chronovolt is buggy slow-paced and jerky in terms of frame rate. There are many action puzzles better than this on mobile devices.
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Game Chronicles,70,At a cost of $10 Ryder White hardly breaks the bank but there are some really great titles to be found for that same cash. This one is necessary only for serious fans of Dead Island.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Hot Games,60,It’s not awful and is in fact a solid platform game but it can be annoying and even worse pretty boring at times.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Worth Playing,56,The frustrating ease of death an uninteresting story and characters washed-out visuals and uninspired gameplay do not a successful sequel make.
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpace,50,AeternoBlade 2 is a continuance of AeternoBlade an action time-puzzler by CORECELL Technology. This action-puzzle game implements multiple styles of combat with an interesting time manipulation mechanic. While the puzzles are mostly enjoyable the combat is largely uninspired leading to tedious boss encounters and aggravating 3D battles that quickly neutralizes the fantastic points of AeternoBlade 2s design.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,GameGrin,45,A basic action adventure game with a great style and a surprisingly engrossing story that is sadly backed up by repetitive gameplay that never evolves into something great.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,Play.tm,55,Unfortunately the main gimmick of the game is pointless at best and frustrating at worst. There are challenge modes available after the game is completed and extra costumes to unlock but nothing to offer real replay value.
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,IGN,50,Overall this is a functional but unexciting trip to the races. Also it isnt exactly easy on the eyes.
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,IGN,45,Mixing a ton of casino games into one package and then tying a goal-based story around it certainly works on paper but when you use low-budget implementations of each and every game to put it together the whole thing falls apart.
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Vandal,45,Bubsy hasnt improved much in all these years. Its short not very well designed and the main character doesnt have much charisma. With so many options in the market right now its hard to recommend Bubsys new adventure.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameTrailers,54,EAs Harry Potter series unceremoniously bows out in this final game. While the previous games were also disappointments this one sinks even lower to full-on cash-in status. What youre left with is a confused mess parading around as a barely-competent third-person shooter.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Game Chronicles,50,A decent game. It has several features and modes that I enjoyed. I particularly liked the soundtrack and the sound effects. I did like the Shipyard the most out of the entire game. Sadly the voice acting could have be a LOT better.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,Console Monster,68,Fun to pick up and play Easy to learn.
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,GameSpy,60,Due to the games poorly crafted A.I. this isnt really a game to play alone. Much like actual paintball Splat Magazine Renegade Paintball just isnt any fun without some friends.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,IGN,55,THQs low-budget truck driving game mixes tried-and-true arcade truck driving with a colorful cast of characters country-flavored humor and a whole lot of gigantic boobery. Its very light-hearted fun for a very short period of time.
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,MS Xbox World,55,That being said though judging the game on its own grounds Koei have never failed to populate the series with its many options and the tradition continues here this is something definitely shedding fifteen or so pound for the Playstation 2 but to pay an extra ten or so on top for the Xbox 360 is hardly justifiable.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,59,Dont expect anything taxing but theres just enough content to make this a worthwhile multiplayer title for the younger gamer. [Aug 2008 p.62]
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,RPG Fan,57,There was nothing fun enjoyable or remotely redeeming about this game at all. The experience was akin to having a root canal.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Activisions Transformers adaptations shed a little more charm and fascination each time they transform. This super-lean take feels like the last OK offering before the rot truly sets in.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,PSX Nation,60,The story is cute but nothing really deep and basically just has you playing the various types of Tetris included to move the story along.
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,Daily Radar,50,An improved version of last years disaster is still not worth the having.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,CGMagazine,60,The game despite its problems can be fun in small doses and certainly provides plenty of old school challenge.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Eurogamer Portugal,60,Sacred 3 - Titan Lords is a game with an interesting story and a world that although huge is accessible and easy to remember. However it becomes extremely difficult to concentrate on the game with such a poor combat since most of the game consists of fighting.
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Xbox World Australia,52,The game is plagued by faults in the control setup and AI deficiencies as well as a limited online modes.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,55,The technical ambition is overcome by nonsensical design and a general lack of creativity.
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,NintendoWorldReport,50,All in all the games okay but feels thrown together.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,Vandal,50,There are some great ideas and some good moments in Husk but gameplay-wise the experience isnt that good and sadly it isnt what you would expect. The developers have promised to listen to the feedback and improve the game so keep an eye on it because even if now it isnt the game we want it could end up being it.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,GamingXP,58,Naughty Bear received a 50% rating and since Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise offers more kills more teddys and a lot of crazy outfits we orient ourselves to the top but nonetheless the game cant escape mediocrity.
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,45,Johnny Kung Fus biggest crimes are likely frustrating difficulty and poor pacing.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,Da Gameboyz,50,There is no doubt that FunTown Mahjong is what it is a virtual version of 16-tile mahjong. Where my issues lie with the game is that the tutorial is not nearly as helpful as it could have been the graphics are somewhat average and the gameplay itself is not nearly what I expected.
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,DarkZero,50,To sum up then this is an interesting game in the same way that Earth Defence Force is interesting. It’s full of silly faults but if you look past them it’s fairly competent.
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,GameSpy,50,Character choices aside if you can get past the occasionally spotty controls and the somewhat sluggish combat youll have a decent time with this game especially if you grew up watching Godzilla and King Ghidorah duke it out on Saturday afternoon TV. Just dont set your expectations too high.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,56,You can blast through the game on the lower difficulty in less than day. You will notice the title says: Beowulf: The Game. Thats to distinguish it from the ancient manuscript. I tend to think of it as a disclaimer or quite possibly a warning.
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,AceGamez,70,If you can get past the technical issues Neverend is a very good entry in the RPG/Adventure genre thats best suited for those who play games to experience new worlds not new technology.
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Game Informer,73,The environments are huge but they dont totally make up for Jonnys lack of multiplayer. [Apr 2002 p.77]
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,GameSpot,55,Street Trace: NYC provides a few moments of multiplayer amusement but it doesnt have enough going for it to be compelling for long.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Games Master UK,52,A game that just cant keep up with Clancys ever-evolving war zone. [July 2006 p.80]
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,games(TM),50,This has little of the charm that make its games so enticing nor does it offer much in the way of entrancing solitude. [Issue#180 p.48]
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,50,I would recommend checking out a walkthrough just to get to the first mission because if I didnt have to review this game the disk would have ended up smashed on the other side of my office in the first fifteen minutes.
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer Limit,50,C.O.R.E. borrows a lot of mechanics from other first person shooters and brings a whole lot of issues along for the ride.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,Play Magazine,58,Though the seamless integration of action puzzles and even a tad of platforming is pulled off well the package its presented in is rather unappealing. [Nov 2003 p.101]
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,GameSpot,49,Not a good game. It takes the primary elements of the Pern novels and uses them to fashion a run-of-the-mill adventure game that offers very little actual adventure and too many frustrating mechanical issues.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,GameSpot,45,Enough effort was put into the gameplay and graphical design to keep it from crashing and burning but not enough to inject it with any sort of life or appeal.
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,GameSpy,60,All of the elements were there to make this an addictive and challenging title. Instead its a slow-paced and confusing jumble.
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Game Informer,50,The play is way too shallow and unforgiving. [May 2002 p.89]
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,IGN,43,A comatose career mode weak multiplayer and lack of flair dont bespeak great longevity. But there are some boxers for masochists to unlock.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,360 Gamer Magazine UK,50,Theres a good game in there somewhere but its hidden behind the arm waving loopiness that takes up the majority of the game.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,GameDaily,50,Its gameplay consists of bland beat-em-up action and imprecise gun control. The in-game visuals vary between good (up close) and bad (zoomed out) and the co-op options are limited and confusing.
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,Nintendo Life,50,The randomised environments at the heart of Vaccine are a clever idea but like in the Wii U original serve up a flawed overall experience.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,IGN,50,Playing Cortex Command breaks my heart. With online multiplayer improved AI more scenarios and a more fleshed out campaign it could be something truly great but for now its just a number of cool ideas and great looks grafted onto noticeably repetitious level design and sub-optimal local multiplayer.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,48,Playing online with human opponents adds a bit of longevity to the experience but ultimately NPPL just gets monotonous far too quickly.
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,55,If youre expecting this to be more than the average licensed game though youll be a bit let down. [June 2008 p.88]
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Cheat Code Central,60,Only two kinds of gamers would appreciate this title: beginners and those looking for an easy hack-and-slash party game.
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,3DJuegos,54,Ridge Racer disappoints on Vita although car handling are top notch.
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,51,Once in a while you get a break from the shooter action in the form of a sea battle. With a single press on the L2 button you can command the human fleet towards the alien invaders. Unfortunately the strategy is about as shallow as the obligatory weather chat at the bakers. [June 2012 p.97]
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameWatcher,58,All in all this is a game that I still feel has potential. All the right aspects are there but the spit and polish is missing the spit.
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,Gamers' Temple,55,The games technical issues and inventory system bring it down heavily. Without the flaws its a decent survival horror game but nothing that stands out that well. If youre a hardcore survival horror player Submersed might be a game to consider (a guilty pleasure) but for those that want a quality survival horror look elsewhere.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Portugal,50,Mindjack fails miserably in almost all fields from gameplay and graphics to story.
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,ZTGD,55,If you’re looking for another runner game with a sci-fi setting Infinity runner isn’t bad it’s just not really that good either.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,ZTGD,55,The concept is a sound one but the technology simply falls short. I would love to see this idea fully realized and perfected but I fear that hefty price tag and poor reception may hinder future iterations in this direction.
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Game Over Online,52,Simply put it lacks innovation. The developers seemed satisfied creating a generic shooter with the most rudimentary gameplay.
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Computer Gaming World,60,An odd duck of an RPG Empire of Magic both entertains and annoys. [Aug 2003 p.82]
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,PSM Magazine,60,This is a much improved effort by Konami but its not going to out-Tony Hawk Neversoft. No way. [Dec 2002 p.42]
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,Computer Games Magazine,50,While no one is going to sling a gold medal around its box its much better than its predecessor in almost every way which boosts the quality from abysmal to merely okay.
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,God is a Geek,50,Calvino Noir needed less time and effort spent on aesthetics and more spent on gameplay and delivery.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,My Gamer,56,If a little more time was spent in development ironing out these kinks then Tornado could have been a solid form of competition for Katamari Damacy.
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,PC Games,64,Only die-hard fans of the Gothic franchise will be able to overlook the games terrible technical shortcomings. Forsaken Gods hits rock bottom of what was once a great roleplaying series.
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Brash Games,60,A game with some interesting gameplay ideas and unique takes on the classic side-scrolling shooter but unfortunately it doesn’t feel as intuitive as other classic games of this kind.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Extreme Gamer,54,Despite its cool cast of characters and excellent concept Blazing Lizards had a good starting point that missed the mark.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Game Chronicles,57,What little gameplay there is on this cartridge is mindless and not very fun.
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Game Informer,60,What the deal with the blander-than-bland texturing? If I wanted to be lulled to sleep I would read a selection from Minnesotas penal code. [Feb 2003 p.104]
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN,50,Its definitely a challenge to get through but the clumsy controls the off-and-on collision detection and the poorly-drawn game perspective is enough to make the game more frustrating than fun.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Softpedia,55,Bombshell is a relatively decent twin-stick shooter. It most certainly isn’t an action role-playing game like its marketing claims. It’s also weighed down by its shoddy story delivery and by its tedious stages.
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,GameSpot,50,Enemy Front lands in that unfortunate middle area where its faults arent bad enough to leave a painfully lasting negative impression but its key moments are too generic to be memorable.
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,Absolute Games,56,Flat and boring. Terminator: Salvation fails to earn other more favorable adjectives. The only bright spot is the soundtrack incorporating Brad Fiedel’s signature theme.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,MS Xbox World,55,Turning Point: Fall of Liberty is a novel idea on paper but is ultimately let down by its shooter by numbers gameplay and under par presentation.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,AtomicGamer,50,It sounds good but frankly it just doesnt seem like developer Digital Extremes were able (or allowed) to put forth the time money or ingenuity to make anything but a Starfleet-themed cooperative shooter complete with extreme use of cover-based gunfights silly mini-games or bad AI - all of which are generally considered hallmarks of a mediocre action game.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,PSX Nation,69,Cheerful juvenile and more fun than what our rating might imply Danger Girl is undone primarily because its engine is riddled with technical flaws (collision detection slug-like speed and frame-rate poor aiming).
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,AceGamez,50,Word Puzzle is a nice title for those looking for a decent word search experience in videogame form and the added modifiers such as bomb timers and stringing words together for extra points is a nice idea to bring in a wider audience but the constricted playing space thats just completely unwarranted really hinders the gameplay when you get to the later stages of the game with larger board types.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,IGN Spain,60,A complete disaster saved by a competent online multiplayer. Devils Third is ugly with bad control and is boring... Itagaki must have been napping while developing this.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Noisy Pixel,55,Seeing that Project Eden is designed to be a story-driven game I could have overlooked these issues and took the game as it was meant to be. Instead what I feel it was meant to be was a game that could have been more fleshed out with more weapons abilities and an extra round polish. Because for such a small team to develop a complete vision of a sci-fi world it seems that all was needed was some more time.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,The Digital Fix,50,It’s hard to recommend Blood Knights when there are similar games that offer a slicker production and far greater variety.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,Game Chronicles,55,Digimon World Data Squad was decent as far as gameplay was concerned but the graphics weren’t the best. I’ve seen better cel-shaded games on the PS2 than this title.
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,Cheat Code Central,48,Games are hard to control repetitive and not very fun. Single-player mode is tedious. Play value is how much the game has to offer not just replayability.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,Games Master UK,58,A frivolous racer with a hefty price tag but brief brainless appeal. [Aug 2008 p.83]
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,MEGamers,50,While they may have had the intention to try the game from another approach they managed to make a very sub-mediocre game that would only serve to kill time or let children play.
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,Worth Playing,45,Though it is a much better effort than the prior game Power Rangers: Super Megaforce is a game that is fine with being mediocre.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Hardcore Gamer,55,Quantum Theory has a lot of problems which is a shame because there is certainly the workings of a great game here even if it is derivative.
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Worth Playing,54,For the most part John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland is not a bad game. It is unfortunately a boring game with little incentive to play for longer than it takes to afford the tractor and ride it around for a while (maybe five hours which is very little for a simulation).
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,GameSpot,47,New Rally-X wasnt a terribly exciting game when it was released in 1981 so its tough to get worked up about an arcade-perfect version of it 25 years later.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameStar,49,We didnt expect part 2 to be better than part 1 but it scores 49 instead of the 48 points of the predecessor. Only 33 more Harry Potter games to go to be as good as the first one from 2002.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Vooks,40,Theres no reason to buy FIFA 20 on the Switch unless you can find it cheaper than FIFA 19 or youre a mad football fan in need of the latest rosters.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameZone,52,The finished product really let me down due to tons of problems - bad AI sloppy controls and slow gameplay.
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,The Digital Fix,60,Spuds Unleashed was not a bad game in fact I grew to somewhat enjoy it. I just feel it took too long to get to grips with the controls and the aiming was sometimes too inaccurate to be enjoyable. If you persevere you can get over this issue I just feel most people will be put off well before then.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,Game Informer,55,For all of the shock and hullaballoo following its path toward release Hatred is nothing special or particularly egregious in the world of video game violence except for the fact that it relies on that violence alone. The game takes itself extremely seriously and has plenty of extremely violent content and murder but it ends up feeling more like camp.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,50,Meant for younger gamers Flushed Away lacks the lemon-fresh tinge that would separate it from all the other cartoon platformers clogging the system. [Christmas 2006 p.96]
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,SpazioGames,60,There are some really good things in New Gundam Breaker but others are terribly wrong. We would recommend playing one of the other far superior Gundam games.
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Da Gameboyz,53,The game’s inadequate control scheme and frustration level is what really brings the enjoyment down.
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Games Master UK,52,Long-term Ape fans will be disappointed. [Sept 2011 p.92]
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,41,Theres a certain amount of tension as the clock ticks but moving the stylus up and down to mow lawns is both fiddly and a bit dull - you really need to keep all three mowers running at once to succeed. Add in a ravenous dog that wants to bite chunks out of your kids and the result is a gruelling unforgiving... well chore.
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,eToychest,50,Everything Final Fight made great is conspicuously absent in Streetwise.
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,VGPub,55,I don’t care how much you loved the film do not buy this game. If your children absolutely loved the movie then give Zathura a rental at most for them to get their thrills.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Hobby Consolas,60,Blades is a free to play dungeon crawler set in the Elder Scrolls universe with some interesting ideas but repetitive even boring levels and poor combat mechanics.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Nintendo Gamer,50,Plays like a second-rate attempt to rip off a series thats not enjoyed a distinguished recent past itself. [March 2012 p.99]
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gaming Age,58,I personally would have preferred a classic Joe title since nostalgia seems to be in these days but for what’s it’s worth G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra video game is exactly what you would expect from a film to game translation nothing more nothing less.
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,PSM3 Magazine UK,47,It is worth a rent however just to savour the few good bits laugh at all the glitches... and to start crying when you remember what Sonic games used to be like in the 90s. Sob.
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,DarkStation,50,What we have in the end is a game that charms you with how it looks and feels but then does nothing to keep your attention. It shows you that it doesnt want to be generic; that it genuinely wants to be an entertaining and memorable experience. However its shallow repetitive and tedious- things that were probably meant to be obscured by its broken online mode. With its likable premise and art style this one really makes you wish it were better than it is. There seems to be a gore-free gem in every genre. Super Dungeon Bros is not one of them.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Has far too many rough edges and faults to come close to Firaxis brilliance. [Issue#95 p.82]
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,Nintendo Power,54,Pitching and hitting play control are intuitive but fielding control is sorely lacking. [Apr 2003 p.135]
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GamePro,50,Save your money for SmackDown 2 or any of THQs other upcoming wrestling titles.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Meristation,50,This Clone Wars game is not the ideal game. It has the potential but it lacks the visual the gameplay and the appeal. Its boring repetitive and short a game just for hardcore Star Wars lovers.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,3DJuegos,60,Yaiba gets some of the important parts right when it comes to a Hack and Slash Game but at the same time it has its issues with length camera and story.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,49,In total the whole Basic Training experience lives up to the basic in the title and will take you an hour to complete.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,3DJuegos,54,Part II has new characters and new enchantments but overall the game falls short of all expectations.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Pocket Gamer UK,50,A side-scrolling adventure based on a great book with platforms fighting and puzzles to negotiate. Some levels are fun as is the touchscreen alethiometer but a few good puzzles aside its nowhere near as good as it should have been.
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Pocket Gamer UK,50,Myst is a brilliant adventure game but without the oomph to show off its gorgeous visuals and sound this DS version is most disappointing.
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,Multiplayer.it,60,Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 does nothing to hide its fanservice nature; besides that the product is still fun to play and able to exercise a certain fascination. But little or nothing has changed since the old episodes with a clearly reduced budget that has even led to cuts.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,PlayStation Universe,45,Far less fun than both it could and should have been Surgeon Simulator ER is undone by poor PSVR implementation and lack of additional content over the previous non-VR release.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,IGN,57,Only fun for a very brief moment really and once that moment passes youre left with a very bland very dated racer.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,IGN,56,But in its current form and with so many other better wrestling titles out there its mediocrity is the only thing thats exceptional about it.
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,GameSpew,50,Despite its problems if you’re a keen online gamer and haven’t grown tired of the zombie epidemic as of yet Dead Alliance may be worth a shot. Just try to forgive its less than stellar presentation. Oh and forget about the single player add-on; it’s really not worth your time or money.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,IGN,60,Though there are some good concepts and admirable intentions here the game just seems unfinished. Performance issues aside the horrible pathfinding sticky interface and bizarre line of sight problems all point to a game that was rushed out too early.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,50,As a shooter you’ve been here a hundred times before. As an Aliens game it suffers the pressure of the legacy on which it’s built and the story is diabolically woeful. Game over man. [April 2013 p72]
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,4Players.de,52,The curse of the license strikes again. The action reminds me of Gauntlet and actually the Guardians stay as shallow and monotonous as the retro classic. No challenge and no variety make it difficult to appreciate the colorful art design.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Vandal,55,This new Star Wars videogame doesnt make the most of the new generation power but also is a boring and dull action game with no variety in its contents.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,Planet Xbox 360,51,A disappointing experience. Leave this one in your childhood memories where you did not mind how shallow it was.

Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameSpot,50,On the Nintendo DS Justice League Heroes is a halfhearted beat-em-up game that does very little to make you feel as if youre controlling your favorite comic book characters.
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,God is a Geek,50,After a bright start Gardening Mama’s irritating faults will have you wanting to throw in the trowel.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,50,Has its charm but is mainly plain boring.
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Planet Xbox 360,64,Hot Wheels: Beat That is the kind of battle racing game that will score well with the younger crowd that the 360 too often forgets about. If you are still of the age where you enjoy the occasional spin around the room with a die-cast car this will be right up your alley. For the rest the shallow repetitive gameplay will wear on you after a few hours.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,IGN,55,It lacks the humor and charm of the original show and even the new one for that matter. It gives you plenty of characters but no real reason to prefer one to the other.
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Impulsegamer,55,In the end Naughty Teddy had the character premise and even the story however the gameplay needed some more polishing.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Eurogamer,50,Bliss Island is about as uninspired as mini-game compilations get with a flavourless selection of challenges and a half-hearted attempt at adding charm and character.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Happy Puppy,50,Cloggy rutty a little bit old and just a little too safe -- precisely the sensations one is trying to avoid with a game based on motocross.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Eurogamer Portugal,50,It’s not really good game or a really bad one it stays somewhere in the middle.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Meristation,55,Funk of Titans is a simple and direct platform game in firsts stages. But its also too repetitive with a weak level design and irregular graphics.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,PC Games,46,Just call the bulldozer already: This theme park ruin is ready for demolition and is neither safe nor enjoyable to play in. Better get Planet Coaster asap.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,GameWatcher,50,There are lots of good ideas here variations in objectives AI companions skill building and numerous aircrafts to fly but it all feels so bland mundane even.
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Nintendo Power,60,Despite appropriating elements from the popular Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and Burnout franchises Asphalt 3D is an unexceptional arcade-racing title. [April 2011 p.86]
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,Zentendo,60,While the difficulty does come close to being cheap at times it’s not to the point of making you want to stop playing the game forever. If you have an extra five bucks to burn give it a shot.
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Hardcore Gamer,50,After such a long absence this is a disappointing effort to say the least. EA has promised that they will remedy many of the predominately visual issues that plague it but until that or a drastic price drop occurs there’s simply no reason to own NBA Live 14 with NBA 2K14 in existence.
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),50,After eight years. the basic gut-level hack-and-slash action hasnt changed much and that makes it hard to keep caring about Dynasty Warriors. [Jan 2009 p.83]
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Power,58,The characters are big and bold and the pace is quick but the characters actions are limited to running jumping and punching even though they should be capable of much more. [Jan 2004 p.161]
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,An average party game regurgitation. Not at this price. [Oct 2012 p.101]
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Game Chronicles,54,Naughty Bear would have been a great $15 Summer of Arcade game but as a standalone retail title I cant recommend a purchase until this hits the $20 bargain bin and even then your standards or at least your expectations had better be low.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameCritics,50,I certainly appreciate what Deadfall Adventures was going for and Im always open to adventuring on a less-than-AAA scale but the over-reliance on shooting and the abysmal voice acting knock this afternoon-matinee romp down a few pegs.
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,1UP,50,The classic games are completely underutilized due to the time limits placed on them causing each to offer no more than a few minutes of gameplay. Theres fun to be had -- just dont expect it to last very long.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PSFocus,48,A PSN game based on the new movie. This game is a first person shooter and the only thing you have to do is kill every alien that comes on your path. The graphical style is unique and nice but the rest of the game isnt great. Its repetitive and boring and the audio is bad.
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,60,It asks philosophical questions but it should have put that heavy thinking into the gameplay.
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,Impulsegamer,56,Ugly unplayable and filled with glitches not even the biggest wrestling fan should pick up WWE 2K20 in its current state.
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,MondoXbox,50,Interesting ideas like the multiplayer interactions arent supported by a suitable structure story and technical execution.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Multiplayer.it,50,Starting from some good ideas Enki fails to deliver the advertised repeatable experience. Theres also some creepy atmosphere around but it goes away too soon.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Hot Games,50,The Legend of Alon Dar goes for the big story (which is lame in its own way) and the big RPG feeling - but falls short on both counts.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameSpot,53,Music is a generic sampling of the pop-punk found in many games today but you wont hear much of it because its obscured by the incessant annoying buzz of motorbike engines.
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Game Informer,55,Think Syfy original movie. [Mar 2011 p.98]
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,Hardcore Gamer,50,One Piece: Romance Dawn is a great idea that was poorly executed. While fans and newcomers will appreciate the story the gameplay feels like an afterthought. It becomes bland after mere hours and starts to feel like you’re going through the motions. This is not the reaction you want in an RPG especially a long one like Romance Dawn.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,PC Gameworld,65,The great sim that could have been Game Tycoon is instead a dull entry in a genre that is already overflowing with dull entries.
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,GameTrailers,56,Iron Man has its occasional bright spots but the gameplay fluctuates between monotony and frustration. With technical meltdowns unsightly visuals and a jumbled plot line there are more than enough reasons to leave this junker on the scrap heap.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,50,It fatally crosses the streams after only a short amount of time. [June 2011 p.112]
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,3DJuegos,59,We don’t know if the concepts of Stormrise will be followed for the future of the RTS genre in consoles but now it is a game pumped with great ideas though these are not well executed. Strategy hardcores can find in it interesting entertainment but as precursory of a new IP this first effort is pretty disappointing especially in this PC edition.
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GamingTrend,48,It’s too bad that this game wasn’t better developed and given more time to polish. Instead of a fine dish of Klingon gagh we end up with poorly sung Klingon opera.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Everyeye.it,60,If you are a fan of Touhou and just cannot do without evaluating your purchase we suggest you switch to the Switch version after a drop in price.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,AceGamez,50,The frustrating and sluggish gameplay is only marred further by some completely uninspiring visuals.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gamer's Pulse,50,Graphical scalability and an intuitive interface are heavily outweighed by poor graphics and sound uninspired gameplay and a lack of scientific information about the dinosaurs you are exploiting.
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,Just Adventure,75,Although I found the game enjoyable and challenging (youll have a jigsaw puzzle to solve -arghhhhhhh) the game does not present much in the innovation department and the storyline is a little weak. But hey this is the real deal - a good solid adventure yarn and I recommend it.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,GamingTrend,47,For the sake of the people in our profession please quality check titles before publishing them. If at any point in the testing you sense an urgency to find something sharp and jab yourself with it repeatedly then make a mental note that it’s the fault of a poor game.
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Kombo,55,It is not as good as The Warriors but if you can look past the SERIOUS glitches its a fun but short game.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,58,The co-op functionality and the vast array of collectibles are nice additions on the surface but being unable to play with friends online and not unlocking anything substantial keeps the experience lackluster.
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,Destructoid,50,Fear Effect Sedna shows that the developer truly knows its source material inside out but unfortunately the gameplay aspect remains lost. With poor voice-acting a broken almost unnecessary tactical system unreliable A.I. and flat action Sedna just isnt fun or compelling.
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,NintendoWorldReport,40,Block Factory is a neat idea that is too ambitious for its own good.
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,Everyeye.it,50,Time and Eternity despite the promises its bland and uninspired. The game lacks everything that an RPG needs.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,GameZone,75,We dont want to work. Its not fun. MC Groovz Dance Craze makes it fun just as DDR has. The difference here is that you dont have to work as hard with this game. You can move at your own pace and work your way up to DDRs level.
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,SpazioGames,55,Bloodforge is a game with great potential unfortunately a very bad technical realization states the failure of the product.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Jolt Online Gaming UK,60,Archlord is a case of seen it before seen it better and the stuff we haven’t seen is going to end up more frustrating and hassle than it is worth.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Destructoid,55,Its a shame because sometimes even when Im fighting the game Im enjoying myself.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,PlayStation Country,50,Nickelodeon Kart Racers is a disappointing misstep. It handles fine with some mildly interesting track designs. Sadly it struggles to really really lean into the cartoons individuality. This is a simple ride that wont offer much in the way of challenge and overall it lacks some care and attention that couldve provided something more compelling.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,Cheat Code Central,50,Other than the three or four hours of play youll get out of Coraline there isnt much left to be done.
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,DailyGame,50,Is this game as bad as it seems? Not really but if killing terrorists is your pleasure you’re better off doing it in 3D with one of the Rainbow Six games and focusing your time on Al-Qaeda-like enemies not the local goombas.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,XboxAddict,60,After the first hour or so of playing I wished I were playing a classic rather than putting up with a new game dressed up like a classic.
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,3DJuegos,49,Brave: A Warriors Tale for the Xbox 360 is a game only recommended for children who are just picking up gaming.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,GamingXP,50,If youre searching for some kind of musical workout this one might be made just for you. Otherwise there are better dance games out there as well as better fitness games.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,IGN,50,Shooting Nazis in the streets of three major U.S. cities should be a non-stop thrill ride that has me on the edge of my seat. This game provides the opposite experience.
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameZone,61,This is one of the few compilation games that actually passes the bar barely. I cant say that this is the one for you but there is some fun found in this title you just have to look.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamingExcellence,51,A game with the same mechanics but vastly improved controls combat and level design could be really enjoyable. SPRay while attempting to do this falls flat on its face in the process.
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,Eurogamer Italy,50,Kursk is an interesting idea on paper but the actual product falls short in many aspects. The gameplay is dull uninteresting and full of dead moments the production values are average at best.
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Generación Xbox,60,Puzzles and stealth are the main attractions of this peculiar videogame by the Prussian Dynamic Pixels. A title full of good intentions but riddled with bad results.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Pocket Gamer UK,50,Steel Horizon offers some strategic subtleties but the slowness of gameplay means it takes a very dedicated commander to unlock its twists and turns.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC PowerPlay,50,Bearing in mind that you’ll need to do some serious thinking Stranger is otherwise a pretty thoughtful game and one that is worth a good many hours play. [Mar 2008 p.62]
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Gamer 2.0,50,On the whole Rock Revolution just falls short on every level.
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Critical Hit,49,If you can look past the terrible controls barely optimised visuals useless trick system and erratic frame-rate issues then MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore might appeal to you.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,Destructoid,50,For someone who actually enjoyed playing CSI: Deadly Intent the minor gameplay improvements here only led to an inadvertent feeling of repetitiveness minus the joy of those amusing cases from the last game.
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Boomtown,60,Sky Diving remains a cheap and cheerful title that will get your Sixaxis muscles flowing again.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,XGN,55,Prison Break: The Conspiracy shows you in the right way the whole prison and the story of Michael. Unfortunately the graphics scores far below and the gameplay is a little disappointing. These are the factors the final grade of this game is nearly enough.
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,Official Xbox Magazine,50,The ride is short and bittersweet. [June 2002 p.77]
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Daily Radar,50,Its fair to say that the interface stands out as one of the best weve seen in years. Shame we cant say the same about the game.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Nintendo Power,55,Success gives you a feeling of accomplishment but the path is paved with frustration. [Apr 2007 p.87]
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,GameCritics,50,With an interesting main storyline creative enemies and fundamentally solid gameplay its too bad that that Arcania: The Complete Tales technical flaws prevent it from being a must-play. There arent enough decent action-RPG hybrids for console players as it is and Arcania isnt going to do much to fix that.
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,PSM Magazine,55,Fans of the program may be able to stomach the shallow repetitive combat and confusing enemy targeting but everyone else can avoid it with a clear conscience. [Jan 2007 p.88]
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,MondoXbox,55,Tennis World Tour feels too incomplete and detached from a real tennis experience to be at least satisfying. A good Career structure and nice graphics arent enough to counterbalance the bad gameplay and a lack of essential modes like online support and Doubles.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Game Chronicles,54,I was a little disappointed with the length of the game. It was about an hour too short.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Computer Games Online RO,50,A dull 3D Action game in the strictest sense and besides the wall climbing or web swinging that your character can do it doesnt bring anything new to the genre
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Worth Playing,55,Sadly this game is no Ikaruga or even a Crimson Skies; the truth of the matter is that I could be playing my old copy of AstroBlast on my old Atari 2600 (well if it still worked) and get the same amount of rush shooting random rocks as I could at shooting down ships and their shields in this game.
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,IGN,55,If you want to be Iron Man go get Marvel Ultimate Alliance or something because this isn’t cutting it.
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,IGN,45,The challenge with Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge is spending a large amount of time attempting to master the events in this budget title when there are other all encompassing sports games that have better controls more depth and better visuals and commentary than this one.
Deca Sports 3,Wii,Oct-26-2010,Hudson | NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Sports | General | General,Nintendo Power,45,The execution feels both overly simplistic and loose. [Dec 2010 p.87]
Rugby 18,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Koch Media,Sports | Team | Rugby,Playstation Official Magazine UK,50,Congratulating Rugby 18 for its base functionality is like cheering for FIFA because they remembered to include the ball. [Christmas 2017 p.83]
Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Four Fat Chicks,60,Legacy: Dark Shadows isnt a bad game and there definitely appeared to be a better game lurking somewhere just on the outer boundaries.
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,GameZone,65,In spite of decent fight graphics and a solid audio track this PC release manages only minimal intrigue and game play that stagnates in the dark corridors that play out as the game’s map board.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Console Monster,50,If you enjoyed the movie the game may potentially be worth a wait but as with most movie game tie-ins the game just isn’t up to scratch and will no doubt be found in the bargain-bin in a shop near you soon.
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,Eurogamer,50,Neither a triumph of design nor storytelling and stymied by poor execution Wayward Manor is a rough proposition. But theres something worthwhile here even if its the unusual power fantasy of being able to haunt an aristocratic family from the safety of the rafters.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,You can almost hear gamers exhale as they play. [Issue#42 p.112]
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,IGN,50,Cyberball 2072 holds up fairly well and the option to team up with a friend and take on some live humans would have made this a great arcade football alternative. As it stands the game just isnt all there.
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Destructoid,70,Surprisingly good. Its definitely not as great in the gameplay department as War for Cybertron with a lot less to do and a far more restricted format but its superior narrative and decent arcade action is at least enough to make it worth picking up on its own.
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Game Informer,58,You know the drill: extremely linear level designs that stitch together corridors open areas and dull objectives with all the refinement and subltlety of a drunken quilting circle. [Mar 2006 p.100]
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,Multiplayer.it,50,Arcania: Fall of Setarrif is unable to bring anything new in the Arcania universe. Same combat same objects smaller locations and lesser graphics make this experience a flat promenade toward an (again) unsatisfying final.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),60,Which is too bad because beneath the sluggishness Mana Khemia: Student Alliance offers an absorbing school experience with quirky characters and a fun story. [June 2009 p.83]
Damnation,PC,May-22-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Zone UK,50,Damnation is so deeply generic and boring so it gets the sort of mark that it deserves. [Aug 2009 p.71]
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,DS,Jun-17-2008,Farmind Ltd,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Cheat Code Central,48,Wacky Racers is still a better cartoon than a game. Crash and Dash is proof of that.
One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,We Got This Covered,60,One Way Trip may not be a great game but I definitely feel like everyone should meet Boobs Cowboy and use the term word more often.
Alien Blast: The Encounter,PC,Feb-9-2004,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GameZone,55,You’re stuck in your gun turret firing off your weapons to an endless amount of aliens and that’s it! There isn’t anything else to do in the game but blow up aliens in your turret.
Robot Arena,PC,Apr-1-2001,Gabriel Interactive,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Breeding/Constructing,Happy Puppy,40,To clarify its your typical boy-meets-scrap-parts-that-will-eventually-become-a-killing-machine tale minus any compelling death scenes or token nudity shots.
Rally Challenge 2000,Nintendo 64,Jun-30-2000,Europress,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Hot Games,50,Its not going to keep you up nights either; its simply an amalgam of traits copied from more successful franchises with a few new innovations that dont really add much to the gameplay.
Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Eurogamer,50,If youre the parent of a five year-old boy you can sit them in front of Emergency Heroes and leave the room confident its less graphically violent than an episode of The Archers. Just be aware that for anyone over five its also less thrilling.
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,PC Gamer,43,Even $12 is too much to ask for what feels like a half-hearted community mod. [Apr 2012 p.79]
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GameSpot,51,It doesnt take long to get over the novelty of the included steering wheel and beyond that this is a very unremarkable racing game that isnt much fun.
Timeline,PC,Nov-12-2000,Timeline Computer Entertainment,Action | General | General,Happy Puppy,50,In an attempt to please everyone the games standard may be that of the lowest common denominator. At least the book is included in the package.
MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,MondoXbox,54,A good activities and environments variety is ruined by too-monotonous gameplay where except for climbing were asked to repeat very similar moves for each sport.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Wii,Nov-16-2010,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,50,This game feels like a preliminary build rather than a finished game and its unenjoyable as a result.
The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,45,The Golden Compass is just another family-friendly film cash-in with few redeeming qualities.
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Video Chums,40,Gungrave VR will make you feel cool as you shoot your foes while dodging and occasionally reflecting their projectiles but its so sloppily put together that its hard to enjoy the action for longer than a few minutes at a time.
Waking,PC,Jun-18-2020,Jason Oda,Action | General,The Indie Game Website,60,In theory Waking sounds like a fascinating project with the game showing hints of delivering a highly tailored personal and transformative experience. But what begins as an exercise for intimate self-reflection wound up becoming an increasingly detached experience for the player. By putting them into the game in the most literal sense Waking fell short when it was unable to capture all the nuances of its impossible protagonist: yourself. While I admire the boldness of its vision I simply couldn’t connect with the extent of its execution.
JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,Trickstar Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Stuttery. [March 2012 p.95]
Taito Legends Power-Up,PSP,May-17-2007,Empire Oxford,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Games Master UK,44,A tepid bundle of mini-games that fails to raise a laugh or even the pulse. [Dec 2006 p.100]
Rapala Tournament Fishing!,Wii,Nov-22-2006,MagicWand,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Cheat Code Central,50,It speaks volumes that when I was taking a break from reviewing RTF I went back to my Zelda game and found myself visiting the fishing hole and enjoying it far more even though its not as complex as Rapala.
DARK,PC,Jul-3-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Hooked Gamers,50,There are certain moments where everything clicks where the stars align and you’ll feel like the dark puppetmaster you should feel like the whole game and most of these moments are because of the powers.
Seduce Me,PC,Jan-2-2013,None,Strategy | General | General,IGN Italia,50,Seduce Me gives you what youre looking for but not much more. It has some nice ideas but theyre not well developed and even the adult content while decently made and with some nice art could have been better. A mediocre game.
Lets Fish! Hooked On,PlayStation Vita,Jan-29-2013,SIMS,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Gamestyle,50,Let’s Fish! Hooked On is simply an average game one that you will go back to once in a while but not one that you will seek out to play. It is a game that does the basics well enough but could have done with more time engaging the player. It is by no means a game you should avoid but neither is it one that you should rush and download.
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,PC,Oct-17-2006,Apeiron,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | General | Modern,Game Chronicles,50,Brigade E5 has the biggest choice of weapons and equipment I have seen in any video game and it is all usable. That in itself says a lot toward the game and its potential even though it does have some larger problems.
Turtle Tale,3DS,May-22-2014,Saturnine Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,50,There is nothing to say about a game that promises very little and aims very low. This is a low-cost low-ambition low-achievement title - there are no significant problems but its margin is so narrow that theres no space to do anything else other having a short-lived entertaining run that wont take long to finish.
Street Supremacy,PSP,Feb-28-2006,Genki,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,50,The game suffers from long loads poor control and an unplayable multi-player mode.
Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,DarkStation,50,Nostalgia is the sole reason I can fathom someone would want Dragons Lair at this point and admittedly the Xbox Live Arcade version is as solid as a HD release as either the iOS or PSN release. Regardless Dragons Lair is a quest best remembered in kind aged memories rather than on your Xbox 360.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Total Video Games,60,It’s a very simple concept if you’re a Pop Idol fan then you’ve probably already put in your pre-order for this game if you’re not then it’s better left staying away from this game it’s simply too shallow and doesn’t last long enough to warrant more then a rent.
101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix,Wii,Jan-13-2011,Nordcurrent,Sports | General | General,Cubed3,60,101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix may not set the world on fire or usurp the likes of WarioWare: Smooth Moves from its lofty perch but Nordcurrents effort definitely achieves some merit for including such a vast amount of mini-games many of which do indeed prove to be extremely entertaining either alone or with three other friends in tow.
007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,52,The biggest problem is the god awful graphics. Even the Bond logo on the background of the menu looks like it was imported directly from a PlayStation 1 game. And thats just the menu screen the actual game doesnt look much better. [December 2012 p.88]
Mall Tycoon,PC,Feb-3-2002,Holistic Design | Inc.,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GameSpot,46,The games excellent music just cant compensate for its poor graphics or clunky interface.
Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project,Xbox 360,Jun-23-2010,3D Realms,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Horizontal,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,A sub-par game that hasnt aged well. [Sept 2010 p.103]
Clash of the Titans,PlayStation 3,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Extreme Gamer,56,Depending on your expectations Clash is likely going to disappoint and even with all its heart and extra features the core mechanics are slightly dated which brings the action down a notch.
0 Day Attack on Earth,Xbox 360,Dec-23-2009,Gulti,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Online play undercut by crummy design choices. [Mar 2010 p.83]
Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Impulsegamer,50,Iron Man 2 limps onto the scene for several game platforms and is a rusted heap on arrival. The bit of fun to be had does not out weigh the not so fun aspects of the game.
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,Vandal,40,Dollhouse has some interesting ideas but currently there are to many bugs including some game-breaking bugs. When it works its repetitive nature shows up and even if the developers fix the bugs we don’t think we would have a particularly good game. At least for now if you’re interested in the game wait for a few patches.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,RealGamer,56,Due to its overall poor design the game seems to of become nothing more then a mass of space shooting sequences.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Nintendo Enthusiast,45,You would need to be a really hardcore SpongeBob SquarePants Rugrats Hey Arnold! or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan to prefer this. I don’t doubt that there is a really good game that could be made with the Nickelodeon license but it needs to have much better core mechanics. And with such a great library of Nickelodeon properties available you can’t help but feel it should be using more of them.
Way of the Dogg,Xbox 360,May-3-2013,Echo Peak,General | Action | General,Multiplayer.it,50,A missed opportunity an original title that suffers from numerous flaws that make the gaming experience flawed.
4PM,PC,Jul-9-2014,Bojan Brbora,Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,SpazioGames,40,4 PM is not what we want from the new school of storytelling. Exploiting themes such as alcoholism and suicide to make an otherwise unattractive project appealing is sinister and disrespectful.
WWII Aces,Wii,Mar-21-2008,Arcade Moon,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,IGN,45,Its still a pretty crappy game but theres certainly a little more merit in this game compared to some of the other lower-budget third party Wii titles on the market.
Delta Force: Xtreme 2,PC,May-27-2009,NovaLogic,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameSpot,50,This xtremely forgettable first-person shooter doesnt excel at anything.
Slain!,PC,Mar-24-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Games.cz,50,Visually nice heavy metal platformer forgot to sell its soul to the devil to get some fun in its gameplay. The creators focused too much on the music and visuals but forgot about the game.
Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Pelit (Finland),47,You come at the king you best not miss. Comparing Alekhine’s Gun to an AAA title like Hitman may seem unfair but Maximum Games made the mistake of trying to defeat the ruler of the genre with its own weapons and they take a beating on every front. [May 2016]
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Deeko,70,The control scheme is impressive the multi-player mode is entertaining and the mission structure is solid but the visuals and audio presentation really could have used a bit of work; plus the game is simply too short.
The Polar Express,GameCube,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PGNx Media,55,A definite case of a game rushed to meet the movie’s release. Blue Tongue incorporated several styles of play but these are blemished by the imperceptive control scheme.
Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,Nintendo Power,48,Responsive control helps make the game an enjoyable play. [Oct 2004 p.124]
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Computer Games Magazine,40,On the whole Evil Dead isnt horrifically bad—just surprisingly limp-wristed.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,IGN,45,If Naval Assault had been a downloadable Xbox Live Arcade title it would have been easy to forgive a lot of its shortcomings. Unfortunately its not; it looks like a last-gen game with some of the worst sound design and music Ive seen in a retail release no mid-mission checkpoints and most importantly not much to hold ones interest for more than a few fleeting moments.
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,GamingTrend,48,It’s a bummer but that’s what happens to most video games as they age: they’re never as good as we once remembered.
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GameShark,40,The enemies are varied enough and can be deadly but they are animated poorly and just look bad.
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,GameZone,50,While not a bad childrens game in the sense of being too hard or frustrating neither is it a good game and it wont keep anyones attention for long.
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Daily Radar,50,Serious motorcycle enthusiasts might want to give this one a whirl -- to crash really expensive bikes on bland racecourses if for nothing else -- but the vast majority of Dreamcast owners will want to avoid this game.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,50,Its a shame Ace Banana can be so flustering because there is a decent shooting gallery to unpeel here. [Christmas 2016 p.86]
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,IGN,54,Almost all of the much-touted style evaporates as soon as the introductory movie is over and were met with stiff animation blurry textures popping geometry a dated engine underwhelming vehicle sound a stale world kryptonite light poles bouncing parked cars forgettable on-foot action and only passable vehicular dynamics.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,Xboxic,50,The free-falling dynamic feels fresh and acts as the element that sets the title apart from the rest of the pack but due to the poor execution of the intriguing gameplay formula and downsides like too little bang for the buck Screwjumper! falls flat on its face.
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,PC Format,51,There are a million and one better shooters out there. [Dec 2006 p.118]
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Cubed3,50,Chronus Arc may not be anywhere near as desirable as some of the other latest RPG releases but for the price it still manages to deliver a somewhat enjoyable traditional and recognisable Japanese role-playing experience.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Nintendojo,42,It’s just too bad that this dungeon crawler just doesn’t live up to what it looks like.
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,IGN,50,Emergency Mayhem is a me-too Crazy Taxi clone with some added Wii waggle minis. If you can live with that -- and the games lackluster graphical presentation -- you will find a fast-paced arcde-style driving game here.
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Nintendo Life,50,Some people may enjoy the interesting control setup and the innovative power-ups but poor level design average graphics little enemy variation the slow pace awful music and bad sound effects ultimately sour what could have been an enjoyable blast.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,IGN,50,There are bugs and instability and interesting environments cant overcome bland gameplay weak AI and lack of polish.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PC Games,51,A terrible shooter with pretty much nothing to like about: the level design is horrible and the AI turns out to be foolish at best. Explicit gore does not make up for bad game design in fact it makes this games mistakes stand out even more. If it werent for the acceptable cutscenes and some halfway spooky level sections this game would be an even bigger disaster than it already is.
Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,GameZone,49,Underground Pool could have been a fun portable billiards experience for your Nintendo DS but limited touch screen action unintelligent opponent AI and poor controls make this one a game you should skip.
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Gamezilla!,69,If youre a fan of McCaffreys writing then take a look at this one -- youll probably enjoy it. But if youre a real adventure aficionado youll undoubtedly find the game too easy for your tastes better to give this one a miss than be disappointed.
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GamerNode,50,Eureka 7 Vol. 2: The New Vision suffers from a plethora of problems ranging from bad combat to a corny story to a bunch of un-fixed bugs. As an interactive anime however youre getting ~5 hours or so of new video about the Eureka 7 universe.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,XGN,50,The show Adventure Time is funny quirky and even heartwarming at some times. It’s a shame the game is the opposite of that and just plain old boring. There is too little variation in the game and with a hundred levels; it’ll be difficult to get through the game.
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,43,Xiaolin Showdown relies on its multiplayer to facilitate replay value. Unfortunately this game doesnt have any. The monotonous and all-too-easy button-mashing combat is so been there done that its not even remotely interesting.
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,45,The only thing Painkiller gets right (sort of) are the original weapons. Everything else is a complete mess. The game looks better than the original but that is about the only good thing you can say about the graphics. Blurry textures horrible screen tearing and slow loading details ruin the experience even further. [September p.88]
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,Hardcore Gamer,50,At the end of the day unless you’re an agriculture fanatic that is interested in the rush of cultivating and harvesting fields for hours on end you’re likely to feel cheated by a lack of content boring gameplay and unimpressive visuals. Ultimately the farm life is exactly what I expected — a lot of hard work for very little pay off.
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,The Escapist,50,There isnt much reason to play Escape Dead Island. The narrative has a few standout moments and youll occasionally meet an enemy that will throw you for a loop. Those moments are unfortunately needles in a haystack of monotonous gameplay thats ultimately boring.
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GRYOnline.pl,45,Inner Chains is scary but not due to its atmosphere. Underneath a beautiful haunting world hides a boring simple shooter. Everything looks good at first glance but the devil is in the details. And the details are frustrating and full of bugs. The entire game looks and feels like an unfinished tech-demo.
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Nexus,50,Unfortunately The Warriors: Street Brawl completely forgets what was fun about the movie and the 2004 game instead the property into a repetitive brawler with no depth or character!
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,IGN,45,Not liking Brain Boost has nothing to do with Majesco copying Nintendo and has everything to do with Majesco not copying what made Nintendos Brain games good.
MTV Sports: Skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald,PlayStation,Sep-12-2000,Darkblack,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Daily Radar,50,Its not a terrible game and if someone were trapped on a long flight with nothing but this game and a PSOne they could do a lot worse.
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,Digital Entertainment News,45,Fans of the show will adore it. Anyone else is more likely to scratch their head in puzzlement and move on to more complete fighters.
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Gamereactor Denmark,50,Zombie-filled races is a nice if not exactly original idea but the developers havent managed to turn it into an interesting game. The gameplay quickly becomes tedious the car physics feel too light the difficulty lacks challenge and frequent slowdowns mar the experience. If youre hurting for a Carmageddon sequel this might sate you for a while but its no replacement.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Gamereactor Denmark,50,Flawed in so many ways this feels like a rushed product and even though the voice acting is by most of the actors from the show it feels as uninspired as the rest of the game.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Maxim Online,40,Passing and shooting in these high-scoring battles is as easy as squeezing the trigger on an Uzi but complicated button-mashing for trick moves muddy graphics and a schizophrenic soundtrack of Method Man TLC and Foo Fighters all draw red cards.
Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu,Game Boy Advance,Nov-24-2003,Webfoot Technologies,Action | Fighting | 2D,Armchair Empire,59,A poorly constructed fighting game that doesnt have the same fun and addicting aura that Street Fighter and King of Fighters has.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamestyle,50,This would make an excellent PSN or XBLA game and would be worth paying top price for. But as a top price full release game this should be a lot better.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,45,The Golden Compass is just another family-friendly film cash-in with few redeeming qualities.
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,50,We know theres a lot of talent in this studio but this time they offer a mediocre experience where even though the main mechanic works its hard to highlight something.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Youd do better to get Kinect Sports instead. [Feb 2011 p.99]
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,60,Moderately challenging and entertaining Acme Arsenal is nevertheless far from memorable. [Nov 2007 p.99]
Real Steel,Xbox 360,Oct-12-2011,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,DarkStation,50,Grinding out levels and paid for content have their places in games and neither should be in a $10 downloadable game based on a movie. There are a few moments that the game feels really fun but those moments wear off very quickly once the grind kicks in. Unless Real Steel is a movie that defines you there really isnt any reason to go whole hog over this game. Oh it doesnt have Hugh Jackman in it in case you were wondering.
Soldier Elite,PC,May-29-2006,Metropolis Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,IC-Games,45,It could have been done so much better there are so many little flaws that add up to a missed opportunity for a decent game. The graphics and physics are very good but the faults with it cancel these out.
Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,Everyeye.it,60,After Depth Hunter Biart shows once again their ability to manage the underwater worlds. Deep Black Reloaded though is a FPS that has many problems but it could also be the starting point for more successful products.
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,55,The game lacks variety but it also doesnt outstay its welcome. If you want some laughs and dont mind that the shooting experience is average at best playing through this alien invasion is probably more entertaining than the movie and youll get some Achievements/Trophies out of it.
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,XGN,50,Montague’s Mount has a fantastic atmosphere but is too slow to get really creepy. With a mysterious tone you’ll want to discover it more and more. However it has too many flaws to be memorable.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,IGN,45,Bad control and poor execution ruin the experience.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,PC Gamer,42,Events unfold inexplicably unrealistically and almost arbitrarily. [June 2002 p.69]
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Its very much let down by repetitive play. [Issue#78 p.85]
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,TeamXbox,50,With a more refined graphical engine better play control and more options this game could have been very enjoyable. Sadly all of the previous elements were executed at a poor level and the game seems very rushed.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,3DAvenue,50,If any publisher wants success with Beijing 2008 they really have to start work on it now because as has been proven time and time again rushing Olympic games does not work.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,48,If you would like to play as the Fantastic Four but in a good game play Marvels Ultimate Alliance.
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,Hardcore Gamer,40,Titles like Senran Kagura or the Hyperdimension Neptunia series are incredibly dumb but are also entertaining. Despite their glaring flaws they warm this cold heart in my chest. Drive Girls drops the ball on every front that could redeem it. It squanders its concept with poor stage design ruining the sense of momentum. It takes what should be a simple hack and slash action game and complicates with the most poorly considered control scheme this side of playing Dark Souls with a Guitar Hero peripheral. Even the story which could have been a redeeming factor by way of just being amiable nonsense is tedious and dull. If Senran Kagura is the one that gets too drunk at a party and embarrasses itself to the amusement of onlookers Drive Girls is the one that pukes on the host’s pets and is confrontationally annoying. It’s unpleasant for everyone and people just want it to be gone.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,Game Chronicles,62,With a narrow vision of gameplay total lack of any story or compelling drama to carry you through 99 missions it is a pure arcade experience that most PC gamers have evolved out of a long time ago.
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,IGN,43,Somehow regardless of genre the franchise manages to wither whatever it touches.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PC,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,IGN,50,Shooting Nazis in the streets of three major U.S. cities should be a non-stop thrill ride that has me on the edge of my seat. This game provides the opposite experience.
25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,56,25 to Life is a lifelessly generic shooter that at times feels like Max Payne without the fun.
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,50,A very ordinary racing game with a wrong-headed storyline tacked on. Stick with Micro Machines for your diddy-driving kicks. [Oct 2006 p.105]
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),50,Clock takes a puzzle-driven adventure game and mixes it up with a side-scrolling platformer. Not a bad design template in theory but not so great as implemented here. [Aug 2012 p.86]
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,GameZone,50,This game just isn’t very enjoyable. Families should go with Mario Kart; while it’s more difficult it’s also much more fun.
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,PlayStation Country,60,Troll and I is a game whose ambition is deflated by a lack of polish and a worrying absence of player guidance. Combat feels serviceable if a little unsatisfying and they find good reasons to switch between the two titular protagonists. There’s an endearing story at play but the game itself has enough issues to stifle the most enthusiastic player. Repercussions from poor execution prevent this from being a truly worthwhile experience.
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,NintendoWorldReport,50,Reflexions is not great. There’s not much content there aren’t enough massage mini-games there aren’t enough dress-up options (at least not yet) and the voyeuristic tone is creepy. And then there’s the fantasy involving Asuka being your little sister which almost makes me want to nuke the game from orbit. For the Senran Kagura superfan it’s probably required reading but everyone else can just wait for Peach Beach Pinball.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,NZGamer,50,Roller Coaster Tycoon 3D is disappointing in every key respect and not recommended - unless you have a morbid curiosity and are interested to see how they managed to mess it up.
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,IGN,45,The Brain Boost games ride the success of Big Brain Academy and Brain Age but fail to actually understand why they were successful to begin with. And thats just not smart.
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSX Extreme,56,If youre older than 12 you have no business playing this game.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,EGM,55,A solid comedic core cannot save what becomes tedious gameplay as you move through the 10 different dimensions of the Multiverse. Throw in the mind-boggling lack of online multiplayer for a suite that clearly could have benefited from it and Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse should only appeal to fanatics of the FOX animated sitcom.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,IGN,45,It could have played like a slimmed down version of Pikmin crossed with quirky yet solid platformer elements. Unfortunately bad control and poor execution ruin the experience.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,My Gamer,52,This game simply cannot be recommended to anyone: the controls are busted the AI is pathetic and even with online play you will grow tired of it within an hour.
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Nintenderos,40,Hello Neighbor shows a pattern of ideas which comes from thrillers something that is common in the present but making it differently. The story in general can last as long as you want but there is a guideline through it. It is despite that a failure because the developers couldnt accomplish its goal in making a proper survival horror game.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Put your $10 toward a newspaper subscription instead. [Oct 2008 p.85]
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Cheat Code Central,54,In short Ju-On: The Grudge is a great idea marred by middling execution. Purchasers can expect some great scares but the actual gameplay feels clunky and unnatural and there isnt much play time to be had here. At $30 this is not a worthy buy.
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,GamingXP,48,Due to the bad graphics and the loveless setting with poor details Thor has dug his grave itself.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Do yourself a favor: leave R.I.P.D. in its grave.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,PC,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | Shooter | General | First-Person | Modern,GameWatcher,50,It’s not a game that you should spend your money on quite yet. Maybe after the passage of time when you can find it cheap or even for free it will be worth a cursory glance. For the moment however it’s best to skip this one out.
Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Game Informer,50,Replicates the movies charm wonderfully but its lack of variety hardly qualifies it even as a party game. [Dec 2002 p.130]
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,Game Over Online,57,It was more like a nightmare than a dream for me. I didn’t enjoy any part of the game and I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.
Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,Xbox 360,Feb-10-2009,Tamsoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,Gameplayer,50,We have no doubt this went gangbusters in Japan but for those with slightly more discerning tastes blood and bikinis are simply not enough regardless of how impressive the jiggle physics are.
Tony Hawk's Motion,DS,Nov-18-2008,Creat Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,IGN,45,A lacking package that players would do well to ignore; especially since the DSi (and lack of GBA port for the new motion pack) is on its way in a matter of months.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,Wii,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,40,With frustrating gameplay a very short and linear experience and no multiplayer or unlockable modes/levels to speak of TotDE gives players no reason to keep playing.
Cartoon Network Racing,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Deeko,60,Despite all the A.I. cheating going on sluggish control and the been there done that track selection Cartoon Network Racing is actually fun. Just remember that little Timmy likes it and maybe...just maybe some of his innocence will rub off.
The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Life,40,Set in pretty landscapes with a storyline full of theoretical potential The Deer God had us highly intrigued during the first few moments of the game. Unfortunately though this instantly faded away and never returned; the repetitive nature of the core gameplay which mostly consists of just running to the right over the same platforms meant that we lost all interest in discovering the answers to its philosophical questions.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,IGN,40,Coffee Tycoon benefits from a subtle and entirely listenable jazz soundtrack but the interface sounds are a little too metallic and aggressive.
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,Electronic Gaming Monthly,45,Should be plenty fun for the very young ones in your family. [Mar 2002 p.141]
Resident Evil: Survivor,PlayStation,Aug-30-2000,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,Spank!,70,Resident Evil fanatics will probably hate it and call it a travesty but remove the Resident Evil tag and its a damn good zombie shooter with a revolutionary control system.
Realms of Ancient War,PC,Oct-4-2012,Wizarbox,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Absolute Games,40,R.A.W. is aeons away from both Diablo 3 and Torchlight 2. Even finding a new shiny trophy is not fun here.
Inkheart,DS,Jan-12-2009,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | General | General,Cheat Code Central,48,There will be little debate that Inkheart makes a better novel and a movie than it does a game. Dont let it break your heart.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Vandal,50,THPS5 is not the game we deserve. We dont know what happened there but its a messy game in many aspects. Still when its gameplay gets to shine we get some of the feelings we expected from it so we can only hope for some patches to help it get closer to what it should be.
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,Game Informer,40,Here’s a tip kids: You can play a better game at home with just a pen. Here’s how: start drawing circles on a sheet of paper. Yeah! You did it! Now your mom has something to put on the fridge.
Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,Vandal,45,And yet another game based on a movie that feels like it has been developed in a hurry and does too many things wrong and just a few right.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,PTGamers,45,This version has serious technical and design flaws that make it not much fun to play and are indication of a rushed conversion.
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,GameZone,50,Thanks to the poor controls and the fact that the levels seem to drag on forever Flight of the Falcon just feels like a very forced and flawed experienced from the very start.
Putty Squad,PlayStation 4,Mar-11-2014,System 3,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,4Players.de,45,What chaos! This is by far the weirdest jump-and-run I have played in a while. Unfortunately it is not as fascinating as it sounds since the novelty factor soon becomes stale and uninspired.
Motocross Mania 3,Xbox,Apr-27-2005,Deibus Studios,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameBiz,40,Driving a motorbike whacking your enemies seems almost like a thing of the past as it was perfected about ten years ago and hasnt been developed any further since.
Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,PGNx Media,55,The developers didn’t develop around the limitations of the Nintendo DS. Part of this is unavoidable since I’m not sure that the Nintendo DS can handle better crashes.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,Vandal,50,Sometimes beauty is just not enough.
Battleship,Xbox 360,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Tactical,Eurogamer,40,It doesnt really work as the game never finds the right way to balance the two modes of play but this brief flicker of ambition offers just enough ballast to prevent this otherwise tiresomely unremarkable game from sinking completely.
Battle: Los Angeles,PC,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Meristation,45,Being a cheap downloadable game is not an excuse for this. Extremely short campaign really low production values and lack of alternative modes or multiplayer make this an extremely poor deal. There are cheaper games that offer so much more than this.
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,Game Informer,40,Rail shooters dont get much more tedious lifeless or ugly than Attack of the Movies 3D. [Issue#206 p.96]
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,55,Although it is simple direct and fun it still doesnt live up for the absolute lack of polish of other aspects.
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Games Master UK,48,A muddled shooter where a lack of braaains and finesse derail any brief undead thrills. [Sept 2016 p.73]
G.I. Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,PC Gamer,59,The laborious mechanics of control and observance make gameplay feel much too random. [Jan 2003 p.100]
Driven,PlayStation 2,Nov-6-2001,Bam Entertainment,Driving | Racing | Formula One,Yahoo!,60,If you want to go high on adrenaline and never mind the pain then this might be the right prescription - so long a s you can get to grips with the controls.
Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,GameZone,49,Drive crash mini-game repeat. Pimp My Ride is a licensed game for die-hard fans.
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IGN,49,Godzilla fans deserve better than this. Unleashed isnt pretty isnt compelling and isnt nearly as fun as stepping into the skin of giant monsters should be. Everything about the game is phoned in. That said my four-year-old nephews have a blast with it.
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,GameCritics,45,With a lack of both polish and ambition Dark will never be anything but an also-ran. As a budget title its a passable entry-level stealth game but theres not enough here to justify recommending it when there are so many superior games in the genre. When a games best selling points are that the stealth is predictable and that the player is a vampire something has gone terribly wrong.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,NowGamer,40,Though there are flashes of interesting ideas none are fully realized and they are hidden behind a technically shoddy and boring shooter.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Everyeye.it,50,TMNT is a video game of poor production values​​ valid only for the die-hard fan of Pizza-loving turtles.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,GamingExcellence,43,Naruto has definitely seen better days. In the end all these problems cant be forgiven when put together not even by the most die-hard fans. Naruto: Dragon Blade Chronicles is perhaps a story that would have been better seen as an animated film. But as a video game you can pass on this story.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Game Almighty,47,Vampire Rain takes what could be an amazingly fun unique concept and basically throws it in the trash. Uninspired and forced stealth guns that don’t get fired undead that won’t die and more are all here.
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,45,With a great story and production values that mightve been enough But everything about the game is less-than-heroic including Thor himself. [Aug 2011 p.77]
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,IGN Spain,50,A game with some interesting ideas that falls down due to a poor execution which makes this game completely forgettable.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,NZGamer,60,The sound in Carnival Games Mini Golf is disjointed and weird.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,57,Unrefined and full of flaws but entertaining - in as may good ways as bad. [Nov 2009 p.86]
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,GameZone,55,The gameplay is extremely basic and somewhat boring. Build up an army go fight go to the next level. And so on.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Game Chronicles,55,All in all gamers can tie a lot of time up into Kengo: Legend of the 9 but so little of it is of any appreciable quality.
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Total Video Games,50,If you’re a fan of The Simpsons (who isn’t?) it’s likely that after the initial appeal wears off you’ll be left with a game that’s better served as a coffee-coaster.
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,Nintendo Life,40,As hard as it tries Blades of Time rarely comes close to emulating the success of any of its obvious muses. Its mixture of third-person melee combat environmental puzzles and platforming are entertaining for a while but they lack the nuance of Capcom’s long-running Devil May Cry series or Sony Santa Monica’s refreshed God of War. Only the ability to control time creating a co-operative element as you team up with your past self offers something truly rewarding to use in battle or as part of a puzzle solution. The MOBA-style overhaul of the games Onslaught mode offers an improved take on multiplayer but the wonky combat and lacklustre presentation are impossible to overlook.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,ZTGD,46,Rock Revolution is a bad attempt at cashing in on the genre. It really does nothing to separate itself and actually siphons most of the enjoyment out of playing music games.
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,ZTGD,60,With a colorful cast of characters and some inventive fight mechanics Legend of the Dragon isn’t a bad game; it just doesn’t do much to differentiate itself from the pack.
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Hobby Consolas,50,A poor shooting game (VR compatible) set in a war between North Korea and United States. Sadly it feels like an old arcade repetitive and short.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,TotalGames.net,51,Playing T3 was a joyless experience and only our loyalty to the Big Man kept us playing.
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,The lack of multiplayer is baffling. [July 2014 p.80]
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,God is a Geek,40,Despite its interesting puzzles DYING: Reborn struggles to be much more than a poor example of horror; the scares are few and far between the plot and its characters are horribly played out and given how generic it can frequently be it’s alarming how seriously it takes itself.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,45,It was a good opportunity to reinvigorate and polish the series and adapt to the final adventures of this characters. But the changes have been executed poorly and that results in gameplay defects.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Vandal,40,It’s a shame the final version of Hello Neighbor isn’t what we wanted it to be. The great concept is poorly executed with plenty of issues ranging from the physics to the AI or the puzzle design.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,52,If youre truly after a vapid brawling experience by all means be our guest. Overall however AA is a shallow trip down license lane and thats all folks.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Dreamcast HQ,60,One thing ECW:AR walks all over the competition with are options and matches. I have never seen so many type of matches in a game before.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameShark,58,It’s overtones about religion and beliefs are something that some may be wary of and those people more than likely wouldn’t want to touch the game with a ten foot pole. Those that can look past that though would have a pretty good time with the game despite its few flaws in gameplay.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,35,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor has all the right elements yet it still manages to do everything wrong.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Play Magazine,50,The game looks three years old but plays and sounds good enough to hang with barely. [Feb 2003 p.90]
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameZone,60,While it has a few frustrating problems Attack of the Clones is just about as good as a Star Wars game can get on the GBA.
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Game Informer,48,The combat is basic sloppy and imprecise and the spastic overhead camera often gets annoying. [Dec 2002 p.152]
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,GamingXP,54,Despite a solid story and decent graphics Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor fails to implement the Kinect in an acceptable manor. And so frustration prevails over the pleasure of gaming.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,Impulsegamer,46,All in all there may not be enough substance for a gamer to really stick around and play the game more than a few times in curiosity.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,My Gamer,42,The updated version is horribly unbalanced and way too difficult to be enjoyed.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,Gamestyle,50,With unique glitches evident Pure Football is an interpretation of the sport similar to Super Mario Strikers with its emphasis on pick up and play.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameSpot,50,While the third-person shooter aspect of Harrys latest adventure can be fun the games story elements fail to live up to those of its literary namesake.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameTrailers,48,The implementation of the Wii controls is solid but there’s no getting around the fact that this is an old game that’s been repurposed for Nintendo’s new controller to make a quick buck.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Nintendo Life,40,Fans of the Touhou Project might get some enjoyment purely from seeing their favourite characters on the big (or little) screen once more but this isn’t a quality fighting spin-off. The game’s slow pace disinteresting plot and lack of any serious fighting credentials leave an awful lot to be desired. If the game was considerably cheaper you could potentially justify a purchase for having quick easy-to-set-up fighting rounds; as it stands though this may well be best left alone.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Nexus,49,Randalls gameplay comes up short but offers a distinct style. However the controls and repetitve combat prevent this title from ever feeling gelled together. Although the art and music are the standout portion of this game its not enough to distract from a flawed experience.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GameSpot,43,Youd be better off staying away from this botched attempt to translate the great ninja stealth action series to the DS. Almost nothing good about Tenchu made the cut.
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,IGN,45,The real reason why you should just forget the game in general is that its simply not fun. There are moments where the mini-games approach mild entertainment but you can have just as much fun -- if not more -- playing a free Flash game. Gosh.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,IGN,44,An essential failure in almost every way. At best its a collection of rather boring events. At worst putting the Olympic symbol on the box is a mockery of the games excellent now bi-yearly presentation.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,Cheat Code Central,44,There isnt much to get excited about with Pocket Pool. Not even the models and their cheesy videos are likely to scintillate you.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,GamePro,50,While the outrageous roller coaster inspired tracks and arcade-themed charm where enough to bring a smile to my face Speed Zones charm is inevitably overpowered by a lackluster control scheme and a barrage of all-to-frequent deaths.
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpot,34,The environments are no fun to get through fights are infrequent and the simplistic combat is unfulfilling.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,The A.V. Club,50,Not half as bad apparently as the new Simpsons Game.
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSX Nation,50,I had some fun playing among the incredible amounts of both confusion and boredom.
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,AceGamez,50,If the developers had made more use of the Wiis unique controllers and cranked up the graphics I could have given this a better score. But like ordering a Mixed Vegetable Soup at my local Chinese takeaway Im going to have to give Legend of the Dragon a number five.
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,48,There were some promising things in Quantum Theory: its story its narrative and even the relationship between characters. But the game has constant ups and downs and the global result is not worthy.
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Spank!,60,Its just Duke being Duke - stupid but fun. For a while.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Next Level Gaming,48,Its just a shame that its got quite possibly the worst gameplay Ive seen in a fighting game I think ever. When I cant play a game for more than 5-6 minutes at a time that is NOT a good thing.
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,TheSixthAxis,40,Agony is true to its name and intentions a hellish experience. My excitement for the game was quickly quashed behind bugs crashes and unbalanced gameplay failing to live up to the potential of the game’s core ideas and outstanding visual design. I hope that I can travel back to Hell following some substantial patching but as things stand Agony is torture in all the wrong ways.
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Pocket Gamer UK,50,A distinct average and oddly passionless collection of touchscreen mini-games.
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,52,Gauntlet with no multiplayer is like trying to drive a car with no tires. What the heck is up with that?
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,TeamXbox,48,Technically unsound with many glitches; some of them major. Playable characters with individualized skill sets is a cool concept. Multiplayer is well WWII multiplayer.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Blackwater is a better use of Kinect controls than most but ultimately there are too many rough edges and not enough of a game here. [Issue#79 p.88]
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,Game Informer,50,Playing the trivia games was about as fun as Bliz got. [Dec 2001 p.118]
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,IGN Spain,50,Unfortunately Left Alive ends up being the heir of a period of Japanese development that we thought was extinct. Neither its stealth nor its shootings convince.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,GameZone,55,There are too many button needs to limit yourself to such a tiny panel of controls. You really need to stand back and SEE whats going on. You must have very quick fingers to survive for long.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Eurogamer,50,As a whole the game feels undercooked unpolished and ultimately unsatisfying.
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,Multiplayer.it,50,Underworld Ascendant is clearly an unfinished game full of technical bugs and poor in content. This isnt’ the way backers and many fans of the series should have been treated.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Cheat Code Central,44,Almost every aspect of the game from premise to execution is highly derivative and substantially lacking. The for-the-whole-family appeal is certainly present but your money is better spent taking the gang out to experience the real thing.
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,ZTGD,47,The biggest disappointment of Ready 2 Rumble Revolution is its wasted potential. There is a quality arcade boxing game buried under that motion-controlled mess and you really never get a chance to experience it.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Official Xbox Magazine,55,Mediocre. [Nov 2002 p.125]
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Twinfinite,40,Crystal Rift features some interesting puzzles and may be simple and easy to grasp but the poor visuals easily manipulated enemies limited field of view in standard play and difficult virtual reality movement means it pales in comparison to the dungeon crawlers of old.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,Worth Playing,55,Traitors Gate II has a few good ideas and some graphics in areas that are somewhat imaginative. This can not make up for the boring game play and downright buggy control system.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,WonderwallWeb,50,If you’re a scream at the TV throw the controller stamp on your Xbox kind of person it’s probably best to avoid this offering.
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Game Chronicles,43,If you love giant bugs and the whole saving the damsel in distress and dont mind shoddy graphics dismal sound and repetitive gameplay give it a shot. But youve been warned.
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Games Master UK,43,A terrible Mario Party clone that offers nothing for gamers over five. [Nov 2007 p.85]
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Nintendo Gamer,40,It might be simple repetitive and nowhere near worth the asking price but Urban Champion is a pleasant enough retro diversion for half an hour or so. [Oct 2011 p.76]
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Multiplayer.it,40,A good idea in terms of graphics and concept doesnt always determine a good game and Lucha Fury stands as an example of this. Charming and interesting to see this game is simply and sadly not entertaining to play.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,PSX-Sense.nl,50,There are a few cute things in here but overall its more of Cluster F.ck than a Fluster Cluck... if that makes sense.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,GameSpot,42,Its an unusual idea and certainly an interesting one but as you play youll find that Combat Medic probably wasnt the best idea for a game.
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,55,An intriguing narrative is interrupted by long bouts of boring wave-based shooting against generic enemies in dull locations. I can’t help but think of the early moments in Ian’s house seeing ceramic horrors in reflections and being excited for a cinematic psychological-horror action game that would never come to be.
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,Play UK,47,As much as we enjoyed Dead Space and look forward to its sequel this really is a poor effort from Sumo Digital and Visceral Games. [Issue#199 p.103]
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,GameTrailers,40,It’s a grind that’s just not much fun to play no matter how much ghost riding the whip takes place. Pimp My Ride falls a few rims shorts of a set.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,40,Battle for the Pacific brings zilch to an already overstuffed corner of the market. Dont let the discounted price or the The History Channel branding fool you the game is a poor attempt at historical immersion.
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Worth Playing,40,A terrible awful game.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Cheat Code Central,48,With no opening or closing ceremonies or otherwise flashy presentation the game is as boring to look at as it is to play.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,Games Master UK,60,Get past the obtuse mechanics and theres a unique retro charm here. [Feb 2012 p.97]
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,InsideGamer.nl,47,This game is better than its predecessor but that does not mean it is great. Its short the story mode is minimal and the fighting system is way too simplistic to be enjoyable.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Game Informer,55,The sounds graphics and controls are all painfully ported from the PC and all of them are worse for wear. [Apr 2003 p.89]
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,GameSpot,40,This wacky action game doesnt contain any of the fun hinted at by its goofy premise.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,IGN Italia,49,Despite the four-year break from NBA Live 10 the Electronic Arts basketball series is back in late 2013 with an awful new episode. Ugly to see and hear and flawed in artificial intelligence and gameplay NBA Live 14 finds some interesting elements only in Scenario Mode and Ultimate Team but NBA 2K14 does much more ten times better and even if EA Tiburon has promised patches and updates the feeling is that the NBA Live series is now dead and buried.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Lamely executed. [July 2016 p.94]
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Game Chronicles,45,X-Men: Destiny is a budget-priced offering wrapped in a full-priced package. By no means is it worth the $49.99 MSRP – which is a real shame given the excellent source material Silicon Nights had to work with.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,IGN,47,This game is literally you punching as your favorite member of the Fantastic Four for hours on end.
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Console Monster,45,Blue Omega Entertainment set out with a clear goal to change the First Person Genre with a mix of FPS and Acrobatics; unfortunately Damnation falls short on both counts and leaves gamers wanting their money back.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Game Revolution,42,I was happy that The Shield made great use of its police officer premise but the game really wore me down. It probably doesn’t deserve a critical thrashing but the gameplay and story can’t compete on today’s shelves.
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,35,It may be fun if we play with friends for a few hours… but it may be not. There are many games fighting in the FPS genre and its very hard to find something worth highlighting in this one.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Its actually quite enjoyable at points. It just feels short and ultimately a bit pointless. [Issue#67 p.105]
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,IGN,40,Had this actually been a game that was comparable to Rock Band 3s Pro mode but with a real six string guitar then I would be thrilled. But instead its an overpriced low budget music game with tacked on power chords.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,GameZone,60,Air Conflicts could have been a great flight-combat sim seeing as all the right elements are present but there are way too many obstacles that make flying these unfriendly skies too boring. Plagued with a number of frustrating problems this is a game that fans of the genre should skip.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,Play Magazine,50,When you take into account the humor the budget price and the ability to beat your (least) favorite celebrity into a bloody clay pulp theres certainly fun to be had. [Dec 2003 p.81]
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,TotalGames.net,46,The fact that the game is so difficult is purely down to the excruciatingly painful controls.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,Nintendo Power,45,Theres no platforming no puzzle solving no backtracking no nothing: you just work your way across the stage until it abruptly ends. [Dec 2009 p.89]
Hollow,Switch,Feb-22-2018,MMEU,Action Adventure | Survival,FNintendo,40,Hollow could have gone further and cemented itself as a good proposal in the growing horror genre within the Nintendo Switch and it gets the ambiance right including the good use of sound effects. It does not succeed at all it could unfortunately as its heavy and cumbersome gameplay losses of fluidity and several technical issues end up plaguing the experience whose plot is also too generic and unremarkable to make this a memorable horror game.
Legends of Pegasus,PC,Aug-10-2012,Kalypso | Novacore Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | 4X,Everyeye.it,50,Legends of Pegasus could be a great game but at the moment suffers for too many bugs. Interesting for the future once patched.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,Xbox 360,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Worth Playing,50,If youre looking at this as a music game stick with either Rock Band or Guitar Hero. They might not feature real guitars that you can plug into an amp but at least youll get a better gaming experience and more players with whom to share the experience.
Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Total Video Games,40,Its ill-thought from the very start which is demonstrated by the contradictions and flaws evident throughout the entire game.
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,GameCritics,45,Alekhines Gun stole from the best but didnt know what to do with the spoils of its crime. The story is interesting and the levels are playable thanks to the source material being just that good but its missing the spark and attention to detail which made Hitman such a phenomenon. The copycat locations may look better than the originals but the gameplay simply isnt there.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameZone,60,There are more flaws in JMSW than there are good gameplay mechanics. Although the odds were against it JMSW turned out to be an above-average game.
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,43,This exotic pedigree gives Torrente the game an air of intrigue that eclipses the final product which turns out to be a typically rotten movie-licensed budget shooter.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Digitally Downloaded,50,That being said though this is not a fantastic game by any account and while there’s a little fun to be had in a frantic online match there are much better ways to get your competitive shooter fix.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,LevelUp,40,Risen 3: Titan Lords disappoints on even the most basic elements which perhaps with a little more time couldve been fixed. Its a shame because we can tell that deep inside lays a game that tries to offer hundreds of hours of fun. Sadly though the only surprising thing about this is that it found its way to the shelves.
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,GamePro,40,Double D Dodgeball should be skipped. Certain gimmicks like skill shots and a variety of arenas do not add enough to warrant a purchase.
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Nintendo Life,30,Arc of Alchemist is not worth your time. We’ll say it again just in case the people in the back didn’t hear: Arc of Alchemist is not worth your time. The story is barely serviceable the gameplay is middling and uninspired at its very best and the graphics often look like they could’ve been pulled from an early 3DS game. That would all be damning enough if it at least ran well but Arc of Alchemist in fact runs at laughable framerates all the way through. That would be damning enough but then the developers have the gall to ask you to pony up forty bucks (at time of writing) for this mess. The Switch library is packed to bursting with loads of fantastic RPGs that are each sure to deliver a great experience. This is definitely not one of them. Please don’t waste your money on Arc of Alchemist.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,BonusStage,47,The fighting mechanics are highly outdated and just dont reach to the heights of something like VF4.
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PlayStation Universe,40,Eternity The Last Unicorn is a hot mess of a game with old school graphics and game mechanics that feels more dated than a launch title from the original PS1.
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,PlayStation Country,40,Tokyo Tattoo Girls promises a lot but delivers very little. It appears to be a strategy game but it basically plays itself with only minor input from the player. Some strong artwork at least makes the short playthroughs relatively enjoyable just dont expect it to tax you.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Eurogamer Italy,40,Terrible useless boring. This would be enough to discourage the purchase of One Piece but what must also be added is the total lack of content.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Worth Playing,40,Infernal: Hells Vengeance has a neat premise and thats it. The gameplay is botched in every conceivable way and the graphics and voice acting will grate on you endlessly.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpy,45,Is Tsunami 2265 totally devoid of value? Not completely but its close.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,n-Revolution Magazine UK,48,Amusing enough for half an hour or so but ultimately the repetitive stunting crashing and bone smashing becomes wearisome. [Issue#21 p.88]
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Worth Playing,47,For non-gaming dorks out there looking for some amusement in this title the sonic aspects of it are where its at.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Next Level Gaming,45,Besides the fact that I should never be able to sit down and beat a game in my first sitting theres absolutely nothing that makes me want to go back and play it again.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,IC-Games,45,Started with brilliant presentation and gameplay and deteriorated from that point on. Although the novel twist of trying to save the ‘bad’ kids does add something for fans of the book they’ll be advised to rent this title before the sugar sweet memories turn into a sour aftertaste after shelling out for this lacklustre platformer.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,45,The whole game looks like it was hastily moulded out of plasticine. [Sept 2007 p.70]
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,Gamers' Temple,40,Dead Space Ignition is not worth the purchase unless you want to get the unlockable content for Dead Space 2 but if you want the unlocks then you may as well just pre-order Dead Space 2 and get Ignition for free. Play the game long enough to secure your unlockables and then go play something else.
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,COGconnected,45,What 7 Days to Die does right is provide a hearty selection of crafting and allows you to team up with friends locally or online to enjoy some co-op action. But is it worth picking up? For the simple fact that there’s better examples of world-building engines out there with a large fan base and even larger servers I say pass.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GamerWeb Sony,50,There are so many profane adjectives that could be used to describe this horrid title but I’ll try to keep it to a minimum.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Console Monster,48,It is quite a poor game mainly due to the longevity though being a budget title – I wasn’t expecting a masterpiece.
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer 2.0,42,There’s not really much more to say about the game other than just ranting about our horrible experience with it. Surely that would bore you our respected readers. We’re actually somewhat sorry that you’re being exposed to this game in the first place. Please look elsewhere for gaming if you want to do yourselves a favor.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Xbox Achievements,50,Enemy Front is a disappointing shooter that has a few good ideas but can’t implement them well enough to make it stand out from a very large crowd.
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,GameZone,45,Even on the Nintendo Wii the game just doesn’t possess the true essence of what makes a good boxing game work on the Wii. Do yourself a favor boxing fans and stay away from this one.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,IGN,35,Unfortunately a promising set of images couldnt prepare us for an absolutely lousy playing game of b-ball on the Game Boy Advance possibly beating out the 16-bit era NBA Jam clones as the worst of the bunch.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Next Level Gaming,50,Theres two cops Mike and Marcus. Wheres the two player simultaneous co-op mode?
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Not really worth investigating. [March 2012 p.91]
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Play (Poland),40,Its a shooter utilizing the CryEngine 2 and featuring one hard-as-nails mega-macho-man with a huge gun for a hand. If this description made you smile youll cringe anyway when you see how many bugs can be squeezed into every single map and how thinly can a texture be drawn. [May 2009]
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,51,With the wealth of FPS options for 360 owners Battle For The Pacific is hardly worth a passing thought.
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,DarkStation,40,Girl fight is a difficult game to recommend. It’s clear to see where the developers were drawing their inspiration however they have succeeded only in creating a game which emulates the bigger budget titles on a very basic level.
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,IGN,45,Some good some bad. It all washes out to be somewhere around mediocre. (Just under mediocre actually. The negatives outweigh the positives in the end since no game should be so dark and drab that it forces you to have to crank your TV up to brightness level 99.)
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,Hobby Consolas,41,We are sure that La Ruina is a pick up artist but he didnt pick our interest for that matter. It will work as a manual for someone we suppose...
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Game Informer,55,A flat-out crappy game. [Jan 2004 p.135]
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Vandal,40,This 3D shootem up has relative freedom of action and good graphics but lacks in gameplay mechanics.
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,Da Gameboyz,45,The problematic controls somewhat bland visuals and forgettable sounds all lend to a game which is going to become bargain bin material sooner than one may hope.
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,FNintendo,40,Bringing Langrisser out of Japan after 25 years is worthy of praise but unfortunately its the only thing worth praising about Langrisser Re: Incarnation Tensei. Its gameplay mechanics force the player to follow a pre-set order to move the characters rather than allowing for a more dynamic choice its visual environment needs a near-complete overhaul and its chapters are simply not motivating to move forward.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Play.tm,40,Sadly Rebellions staid middle-of-the-road performance continues with Shellshock 2: Blood Trails which although not unequivocally broken is so thoroughly unappealing and last generation that its all-but guaranteed a well-deserved place amid the lower echelons of gaming mediocrity.
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Hardcore Gamer,40,Fireburst is mediocre at best playable whenever you have friends over but not necessarily a first choice in anyone’s library. With the lack of any real story or campaign mode and busted online features there are games that do a lot better than this offensive boring and buggy arcade racer.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,games(TM),40,Its only when the game reaches Soviet-occupied Afghanistan the weakest of the movies that the game boasts moments of genuine enjoyment. [Issue#146 p.119]
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,PC Gamer,40,This gameworld is essentially a bad parody of a David Lynch production. Every scene is draped in weirdness wallpaper. It’s weird all right but not exactly engaging.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,44,Another videogame based on a popular motion picture another bad review score. Even though it has no shortage of bullets The Expendables 2: The Videogame fails to hit the bulls-eye. This 4 player co-op shooter is no action hero.[October 2012 p.79]
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GameSpy,39,Even by GBA standards leaves its players sorely wanting.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Games,49,Boring and buggy third-person-action-adventure that features two different characters one action-focus the other one stealthy. But the much too hard difficulty level and the more than stupid AI tear every bit of fun out of Shadow Harvest.
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,IGN,40,There’s nothing natural about AI that faces the wrong way in combat or a shooter who doesn’t know what gear he brought into combat or squad members who can’t communicate. When shooting for authenticity a half step is not enough.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,44,Repetitive and uninspired missions abound as do glitches that can make completing missions more difficult or even impossible without reloading. The lack of a co-op mode for the campaign is also a huge letdown.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,40,You can send out fellow survivors on scavenging missions the downside of this is that they can fail or even worse die. Unfortunately the number of goods they collect is so abysmal you wont care if they make it back or not. [May 2013 p.88]
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Xbox Tavern,45,Past Cure offers an interesting story one that’s buried deep underneath a plethora of technical issues and poor execution.

March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,GameSpot,40,Ironically while this penguin-themed puzzle game seems geared toward younger players it may be too challenging for the average kid.
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Generación Xbox,43,Agony promised a lot but it fell short and failed to meet expectations. Lots of bugs and inconsistent quality.

Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Nintendojo,45,If you really want a good Astro Boy handheld experience pick up Astro Boy: Omega Factor if you can. Otherwise you would be better off looking elsewhere for a platforming experience on Nintendo DS.
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,AceGamez,40,A proper next-gen update to the classic franchise is something Id love to see but with its myriad of flaws and questionable change in style this game simply doesnt cut the mustard.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Nintendo Life,40,The nature of Fantasy Hero ~unsigned legacy~’s mission based structure lends itself well to the pick up and play style of Nintendo Switch but there’s nowhere near enough compelling content here to make it worth your time. A dull plot filled to the brim with typical JRPG tropes fails to give you much of an incentive to progress while the combat itself is far too basic and at times punishingly difficult. This may have been a passable experience upon its original release but in 2018 this port has little to offer.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,39,Neither quality fan service nor a good action game on its own merits The Shield fails miserably to live up to its licenses pedigree.
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Meristation,35,Girl Fight is a bad copy of some fighting games. Simple and poor gameplay generic visuals with few issues in stages and animations and only the most basic modes available.

Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,TeamXbox,40,A horrible game? Not at all... Some positives include its clean look tolerable music and ease of play. Anyone can pick it up and start playing.
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Everyeye.it,45,AMY is a total delusion: poor game design and a underwhelming graphic trasform an hyped game in one of the worst digital delivery game of this winter.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,IGN,40,Kick-Ass is a poor beat-em-up that feels rushed at every turn.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,Pocket Gamer UK,40,Its less to do with being the Man of Steel more a rusty version of the tin man – because this is a game without a heart.
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,Gamers.at,52,Of course we anticipated for this game to be bad – but honestly even for a movie tie-in this is just ridiculous. It deserves to go straight to the wastebasket.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Yahoo!,50,Its not all bad just needlessly frustrating. Once you get your head around the controls and deal with some of the flawed game mechanics Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing becomes mildly enjoyable.
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,MondoXbox,50,Farming and breeding must be a very boring and repetitive activity or at least this is what Farming Simulator 2013 makes us believe. Giants Software made a pretty impressive reproduction of the farming activities and tools but they totally forgot that a game needs to entertain or at least involve its public.
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,GameWatcher,40,X: Rebirth will get better over time and anyone who’s open-minded enough to look past the ‘X’ branding and see the ‘game’ may even find many hours of entertainment.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,SpazioGames,48,Dawn of Fear in a true old school survival horror but is literally devastated by too many technical flaws.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,Cheat Code Central,40,From the gameplay to the graphics Van Helsing is one poorly developed game. I dont even care what the excuses are this game should not have been released in the state that its in.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameNow,42,I was even less impressed by the games fighting system. There isnt an ounce of technique involved. Just walk up to an enemy and rapidly punch it until it goes down.
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,All Game Guide,50,Unfortunately the flaws especially in the more difficult battle scenarios make the idea of replaying somewhat moot.
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,GameSpy,40,The idea is solid but the haphazard controls suck most of the enjoyment from these rails. Wed like to see more dragons in our games but requiring the use of an ice pack after bouts with the stylus seems unnecessary.
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,40,Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified is one of the worst chapters of this popular franchise. The short campaign and the clumsy multiplayer are lethal shots to the poor PS Vita existence.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameZone,50,The interface is barely useable and the combat is a fairly simple affair. The graphics are weak and though the story is interesting you will probably not want to play through the game to see the plot go forward.
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameSpy,40,If you like fighting games pick up another one.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,GameZone,48,No tutorial no use of the sixaxis wingmen that would just as soon walk into a wall as fight things are looking pretty bleak. Melee combat with weapons is impossible to work.
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Weve reached the point in the 360s lifecycle where even movie tie-ins have decent graphics. Too bad that the only part of Megamind: Ultimate Showdown that doesnt totally suck. [Feb 2011 p.83]
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,Game Chronicles,45,And while the FMV movies are definitely worth checking out – if only to laugh at their ridiculousness – it is not worth plunking down $40 for.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Worth Playing,40,Iron Man for the PC is another casualty in the sad and lengthy history of failed movie-game tie-ins.
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Yahoo!,40,A mediocre game at best. Graphically and sonically it stinks but with a better framerate these issues and enemy AI problems could have been forgiven.
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Everyeye.it,40,Rough around the edges would be an understatement. Sadly its just hard to find a reason why you should play Rekoil given the abundance of choices in its genre.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,Hardcore Gamer,40,If you’ve got the tolerance for terrible and the four hours or less that it takes to beat the game maybe you’ll have fun groaning at how bad Zombeer is too.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),40,Unfortunately this niche sport has spawned a niche game that lacks the more obvious draw of the beach variant and will interest only the hardest hardcore fans. [Nov 2008 p.83]
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,IGN,40,Not only did it skip over the elements that make the TV show so memorable in terms of its presentation but it wasnt much fun to play either.
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,Gameblog.fr,40,Weeping Doll had good ideas and a good horror atmosphere but the game lacks ambition and finishes after only 40 minutes!
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,DarkStation,50,Battling zombies should be an exciting and frightening experience but instead turns into a farce with laughable AI and linear gameplay.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,4Players.de,55,The concept actually works. The change of perspective as well as the new art direction build a solid foundation. But under the surface nothing really comes together.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,Multiplayer.it,40,Simply put Sonic Boom is one of the worst Sonic games in recent memory: the concept is bland the design is awful and the execution is incredibly poor.
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Generación Xbox,40,The Deeli Network studio has suffered from inexperience and wanted to cover too much in this first title staying halfway through it all.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Age,33,While the concept sounds like fun nothing works how you think and it ultimately turns into an unenjoyable experience. I really cannot recommend this one on any level.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Worth Playing,40,This isnt a game as theres no real reward for doing well other than unlocking more tests and its not really a brain-training device because it doesnt teach you anything.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,MondoXbox,45,The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is based on a good idea - wed love a good TWD survival game - but with a very poor execution.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,PC Gamer,53,Its individual parts are pure hit-and-miss but if you overlook the misses and get on with killing bad guys youll have a good time. [July 2003 p.82]

Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,Worth Playing,35,There is absolutely no reason to purchase Jenga World Tour over a copy of the physical game. The latter is cheaper less painful on your eyes and significantly more fun.
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameTrailers,44,With sub-par controls an unattractive presentation and nothing to do but fight the same simplistic and unrewarding fights over and over again Fighters Uncaged is a stumbling failure akin to a fighter whos doomed to a forgettable career as a low-ranking amateur.
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Worth Playing,40,BMX Challenge is not interested in style quality or progress. It feels like a lost project from the me too era of five years ago when every other company was looking to break into the genre.
Coliseum,PC,Jan-6-2004,Stormcloud Creations,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing,Game Over Online,48,It’s flawed and it’s buggy and there just isn’t enough to do in the game to make it fun.
Kabuki Warriors,Xbox,Nov-19-2001,Light Weight,Action | Fighting | 2D,Xbox Exclusive,50,Even though this isnt a fast paced game and you may find it to be a little more dragging than your usual fighting game the different objectives that you complete in your fights are something that is fairly new and innovative.
Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,GameSpot,50,Twitchy controls and poor presentation eclipse what little fun there is to be had with this middling billiards game.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,RPGamer,30,The more one looks back on it the more it feels like Magus primary purpose was to acquaint a new development team with the tools at hand while building up a few skills.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,ICXM,50,Demanding $50 for Ghostbusters which is clearly designed as a much smaller title is unforgivable and honestly approaching fraud.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,PSX Nation,70,The game is like a very sweet cake. The first bite is sorta nice and sweet but then its just too much and you dont want anymore.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,PlayStation LifeStyle,40,Despite the fun character customizations Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5 suffers from a number of issues including laggy multiplayer dipping frame-rates and off-putting physics. Sorry Tony but nostalgia can’t save you this time.
Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,30,Normally when someone has to experience this level of tedium and frustration they at least get paid minimum wage. Instead youll have to buy Toy Shop if you want to have all the monotony of working a terrible job in the palm of your hand.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,Gaming Nexus,42,Amusing for a short period of time the Asskickers will ultimately wear out its welcome in your gaming agenda in just a few hours or plays. Its a fun reminder of what the beatem up genre has to offer but will unfortunately remind of what is wrong with it as well. Die hard beatem up fans only need apply... and even they wont be entertained for long.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,Pelit (Finland),60,Dead Horde is dead awful. [Sept 2011]

Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,TheSixthAxis,70,The motion controls aren’t the best and I wouldn’t recommend using them while the stuttering on the loading screens also needs addressing. If you’re looking for a small game to play though and like first person runners then Infinity Runner could well be for you.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Xbox Nation Magazine,60,Everything about it screams budget sure but there are much worse full-priced games on the Xbox. [Oct/Nov 2003 p.99]
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,PlayStation LifeStyle,65,The gameplay loop of loot shoot and run all feels good and I’d like to see more story added to the game. Also it would be great if there were more machines more weapons and proper difficulty scaling for players who want to play by themselves. Above all the world is just too big.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Computer Games Magazine,50,Given the decidely mixed gameplay you have to have a certain love of kitsch to get far in Hard Truck Apocalypse. [Oct. 2006 p.68]
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,Operation Sports,60,For $20 you get a variety of games that is far beyond anything else that I’ve played on the PS2. The game plays well if you don’t feel like you have to have a deep and detailed story mode.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Eurogamer Italy,70,This game is for gamers who love jrpg manga anime moe and those kinds of entertainment. The main concept is funny enough to catch the players interest and the gameplay is quite good. Unfortunatly the graphs engine is old and clumsy.
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,SpazioGames,65,Bravo Team is a good game that manages to recreate the feeling of collaborative shooters from the old days.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,50,There’s moments of fun to be found here but I think I’d be better suited trying my luck on the consoles – at least there I can expect a solid framerate and finer camera control. But the search for a quality 3DS character action game will have to continue for now.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,PSM Magazine,60,Had potential but its ultimately too unpolished and player unfriendly for any but the most puzzle hardcore. [July 2005 p.88]
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,GameSpy,60,The elements were in place for a solid platforming title with a little hand-to-hand combat thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately a painfully annoying camera and some downright boring combat kept that from coming to fruition.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Informer,65,With better action games out there for GBA I suggest leaving this earthworm to the fisherman. [Sept 2002 p.94]

Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Jolt Online Gaming UK,55,This game is an unchallenging space shooter made a little more difficult with frustrating design and a terrible camera angle. Even if you’re a fan of the TV series we really cannot recommend a purchase.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Hobby Consolas,65,The new project from Sonic’s father Yuji Naka brings an adventure on sky pretty difficult to control with beautiful but simple landscapes and an amazing story. Sadly we expected more from the little robot Rodea.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,Video Game Talk,60,Warriors: Legends of Troy is a pretty impressive project from Tecmo-Koei Canada. It features an interesting storyline that provides a great backdrop for a video game as well as some well-done cutscenes and audio. However its repetitive gameplay is something that will turn a lot of people off even if it is more polished than its ever been.
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Game Over Online,68,I came into it expecting something terrible given the reputation of past Ford games but I ended up with an above average game that didnt really screw anything up and actually featured innovation - so Im quite pleased with it.
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamingExcellence,64,If Darkest of Days were a film it would make the rounds at festivals where flawed but interesting has its place.

The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,65,Far from being a masterpiece The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2 for a budget price offers a single player campaign that lasts about five hours an interesting co-op mode for four players and a series of classic multiplayer competitive modes.
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GamingTrend,67,But if youre a person who doesnt want to wait around for patches and who likes a gaming experience you can glide into rather than struggle through I sadly suggest either giving this one a pass or at least giving it time to get patched up in time for a steep Steam sale.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Game Informer,60,About as much fun as giving an elephant a suppository. [Jan 2006 p.157]
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Cheat Code Central,52,Just like the first entry this one doesnt try to escape from the simple button mashing combo street brawler.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Game Informer,60,Fighting moving and pulling off cooperative attacks as the Turtles is enjoyable but it’s difficult to find fun in the world and routine in which they exist.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,TeamXbox,56,For younger gamers it tries to offer some valuable lessons about respect for others and responsibility but the message seems to be clouded by all the pointless side missions and mindless monologues of other characters.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Official Xbox Magazine,58,The gameplay however suffers from severe redundancy. [Jan 2003 p.83]
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,GameSpy,67,The framerate is horrendously bad at times. Theres no logical reason why a game representing a sport with nearly as many TOTAL players as other sports have per TEAM should suffer framerate hits.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,MS Xbox World,65,As a Watchmen fan it was impossible for me to not enjoy this game. For anyone else however there just isn’t enough substance to warrant the ridiculously overpriced cost.
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,TeamXbox,50,The drive anywhere at anytime mentality that seems to be the driving force just wasnt executed well enough so instead the game remains a generic racer with a Hummer coating.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameZone,55,Repetitious button-mashing gameplay that rarely engages the brain is the undertone of this title.
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,ZTGD,68,Last Rebellion is a game that will likely become a niche title down the road and for good reason. The combat system is definitely something special. If only everything else had come together this game could have easily been a must-own.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Pocket Gamer UK,50,Buggy and unpolished Chronovolt isnt worth your time no matter how many times your turn the clock back.
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,SpazioGames,70,Ryder White is a good DLC. It is essential to understand background and mentality of the greatest enemy in Dead Island. If you loved the full game dont miss it.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameZone,62,The actual gameplay is unlikely to impress serious gamers and may to some the game may be found seriously wanting.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Game Informer,60,Playing through State of Emergency 2 is a lot like watching a decent actor try to produce a real performance in a straight-to-video horror movie. [Apr 2006 p.122]
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,Switch Brasil,50,AeternoBlade II had the potential to be a notable metroidvania in the Nintendo Switch’s library but unfortunately it will be remembered as little more than a bug-laden mess regardless of the couple of interesting ideas it brought forward.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,Nintendo Life,50,Fimbul creates an appealingly grim Norse folklore-infused world to adventure through but its core action is simply too weak to seal the deal. Its pacy combat can be brutally satisfying but its also shallow and repetitive while the game struggles from a technical perspective. Theres a promising world at the heart of Fimbul but it needs to be married to a more fluid and fleshed-out game.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,3DJuegos,58,Golden Axe: Beast Rider confuses the tribute to retro with the flat and boring gameplay. The new game of SEGA is mediocre in every aspect and comes as a failure in its attempt to recover a legendary name and turn it into a worthy product of Next-Gen platforms.
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Multiplayer.it,55,MotoGP 08 delivers a sub-par experience in every single aspect: graphics are shallow controls are dull and unresponsive and the gameplay is kinda boring. Still its one of the few serious racing games on Wii but thats hardly gonna be a selling point.
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,AceGamez,50,Hard Rock Casino shouldnt be a terrible game but it is.
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Informer,55,Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back underwhelms and disappoints at every turn. Bland level design never improves and tedious boss battles are unrewarding and unsatisfying. Bubsys return 21 years later could have reminded us why he was once considered a potential peer to the likes of Mario and Sonic. Instead The Woolies Strike Back only serves to remind us why the mascot hasnt seen a new adventure in over two decades.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,MondoXbox,55,A mere add-on to the previous game short and without any improvements to the first game even losing features like Kinect support.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GamingExcellence,50,Swashbucklers doesn’t have anything that’s worth the purchase and it can be looked over by most gamers.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,70,Discs of Tron does hold quite a bit of enjoyment especially of the latter stages. [Issue#31 p.117]
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,BonusStage,66,Though Splat Magazine Renegade Paintball has some serious problems it delivers an authentic paintball experience rife with intense adrenaline-pumping action that is sure to please fans of the sport and possibly snag some new ones in the process.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Computer and Video Games,58,If humorous driving jaunts are your bag do yourself a favour and bag San Andreas instead.
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,3DJuegos,58,Its the same game youve been playing a long time ago. At least Koei fanatics might be satisfied with the formula.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,VideoGamer,60,As it is Big Beach Sports will provide some fairly limited short term fun but when available for less than £20 maybe thats not such a bad thing.
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,Game Over Online,62,I can’t think of another game where the developers apparently tried so hard to make it no fun to play. As a result The Sacred Rings is just a bad game. The puzzles are tedious the locations are dark and the premise is silly (you actually spend more time trying to reunite two dead lovers than you do dealing with the Sacred Rings).
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,LevelUp,53,Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark main problems are that High Moon Studios didnt developed it and that the terrible Michael Bays movie Transformers: Age of Extinction was merged with the marvelous universe of War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,TotalGames.net,65,At a tenner this would have been okay but for a penny under £20 this just can’t be recommended.
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,Dreamcast.net,61,The fact is both NFL2K and NFL2K blow this game away on literally every level.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,Push Square,60,Its a quaint little curio for fans of arcade games then but its not exactly a must have.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,60,The biggest issue is not that the development set their sights incredibly high but simply that this kind of game is a mammoth project and there is simply no way that a limited budget can pull off something of the standard of say Skyrim. Risen 3 is a raw entertaining experience that lacks polish but offers substance.
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,MS Xbox World,60,It looks nice it plays nicely and its short BUT it is a budget title and at £20 it is a steal.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Nintendojo,65,Every platforming challenge is camera related. Its sad because there is a lot of untapped potential in Pac-Man World 3.
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Da Gameboyz,55,Overall this is the nicest cleanest 3D game I have yet to see on the 3DS. I cant wait to see more titles from Ubisoft as it appears that they have utilized the 3D screen to its fullest. Unfortunately for its lack of gameplay variety and the simplistic controls I do not recommend it for more mature gamers.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,COGconnected,60,One could also make the argument that if a game’s story is poor the gameplay can at least make up for it and vice versa. Husk manages come frustratingly close at times leaving the game undone by its inconsistency.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,TheSixthAxis,70,Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise is a much better effort than its predecessor. By adding in the costumes system 505 Games have managed to give the game a layer of depth previously missing. However whilst repetition doesnt entirely spoil the party it certainly takes the shine off after a while.
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,Nintendojo,50,In the end I was left with the feeling that Johnny Kung Fu was sold short of its true potential. The basic premise is good the gameplay (well half of the gameplay…) is spot on but sadly the game is hindered by an unnecessarily brutal spike in difficulty and a repetitive unrewarding design that makes a game that was once unique and challenging turn into to a bore of a reaction-time test.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,Level7.nu,50,Funtown Mahjong is a simplified version of the more complex Chinese board game mahjong. The main issue plaguing this title is the fact that its not simple enough to attract the uninitiated while not being challenging enough for the veterans. The game could very well have utilized the possibilities that a console game offers to the gameplay mechanics but since this isnt the case youll be better of taking a closer look at the real deal.
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,60,Unlocking different vehicles and tracks for the multiplayer provides some incentive to push onward but theres not much past that.
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,Game Chronicles,61,Sadly enough these great features cannot save you from a horrendous storyline generic sounds and iffy controls.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Informer,58,In this day and age it shouldn’t come as a surprise that a game based on a movie fares poorly but for a character who has survived since 700AD he deserves better treatment than this.
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,Next Level Gaming,74,The graphics hold the game back as most PC RPGs are better looking.
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,GamePro,80,The visuals and sounds keep up with the pace although you may be too busy with the controller to notice.
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,MS Xbox World,60,Unfortunately for Street Trace there are just far too many better games coming down the road for it to be able to maintain the multiplayer community it will need to succeed.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Next Level Gaming,59,There comes a time when you should just move on. I think Tom Clancy games and the Playstation 2 should go ahead and part ways. The system just isnt powerful enough to do what I think UbiSoft really wants to do with their games.
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,Destructoid,50,If Harmonix Music VR sounds like your jam it probably is. Plopping on the helmet after eating your favorite comfort food can make for a really relaxing afternoon but the other modes arent even worth the time of day.
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameZone,64,The dated graphics repetitive sounds and high difficulty make this game more frustrating than it has to be.
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Worth Playing,55,You could definitely pass up C.O.R.E. and while I like the idea of someone at least trying to put out a genre title that doesnt typically get made on the NDS I also feel that C.O.R.E. is an example of why FPSes dont make the transition well to the DS.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,Next Level Gaming,62,If any more Oddworld games are brought to the GBA I really hope that they go back to the side-scrolling format. In fact a direct port of the original Oddworld for Playstaion wouldnt be a bad idea and would have surely come out better than this game did.
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,Yahoo!,70,An absolute must for fans of the series - its as engrossing and complex as the best of Anne McCaffreys novels and as a stand-alone story its fun and well worth it.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Pocket Gamer UK,50,Visually disappointing lacking in challenge and generally not that much fun Iron Man singularly fails to communicate the excitement found in its big screen counterpart.
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,Game Informer,65,Even with relatively few RPGs on the GameCube Falsebound Kingdoms relatively simple approach isnt that captivating - unless youre a Yu-Gi-Oh fan who is a newbie to the RPG genre. [Jan 2004 p.141]
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Gamer's Pulse,50,The fighting is slow and boring with even slower controls the graphics aren’t much and the sound is just average.
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Hot Games,60,If youre a fan of the child-eating boxer help yourself to a serving of Mike Tyson Boxing. Otherwise spend your bet money on Knockout Kings or Ready 2 Rumble 2.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Sadly the games not much fun - you get bored easily and theres not much variety to be had waving your arms up and down. [Dec 2006 p.99]
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,TeamXbox,55,When all is said and done Hellboy: The Science of Evil might have been a hit during the last generation of consoles. On the current consoles though it just falls short in nearly every regard.
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,Switch Player,70,A game which seems to draw a lot from Resident Evil Vaccine is more than just a clone; its a hard-as-nails rendition of what the series would be like if it was procedurally generated and smaller in scope. At this theyve succeeded and have managed to weave in some fun to boot. Its not the best Resident Evil clone Ive ever played but its better than average - and the gameplay twists are both addictive and satisfying in their own right.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,Multiplayer.it,60,Cortex Command is brilliant but unfortunately still incomplete. The strong community is trying to fix the many problems the games has but as of now it still not enough. For almost twenty euros we can recommend the game only to the most patient gamers.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,IGN,49,It’s easy to see how paintball enthusiasts could love this game but hard to envision anybody else spending more than an hour playing it before they got bored and disillusioned.
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Zentendo,60,Overall the Iron Man title on the Wii lacked the spark that the film had; however it’s a huge step up from last years A2M film franchise adaptation known as The Golden Compass. That said if players are looking for a film to game adaptation that actually reflects the film they should look elsewhere.
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Play Magazine,60,BS is no gem mind you but it is strangely addicting as these games tend to be when the mood strikes. [June 2003 p.57]
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Games Master UK,60,Disturbing lack of content impedes the score but what is here is streamlined speedy fun. [March 2012 p.75]
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,AusGamers,52,This is not going to set the gaming world on fire by any means but if youre a sucker for movie tie-ins have reasonable to low FPS expectations and dont mind some light RTS antics Battleship is a decent enough distraction for a handful of hours or so.
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Computer Games Online RO,61,The main problem of SunAge is that without the patches released the game is a disaster.
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,Hobby Consolas,62,Submersed is a survival horror game with good ideas drowned by a short duration bad enemy and level design weak gameplay and a narrative that feels underdeveloped.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Games Master UK,58,A great concept brimming with unexplored potential anchored by dull shooter mechanics.
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Xbox Achievements,55,As endless runners go Infinity Runner is a fine example but greatly lacks polish and finesse.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Game Informer,58,The huge level of frustration is not worth the time it takes to master the awkward gameplay idiosyncrasies. Instead it’s more tempting – even as someone with experience – to just spam the waggle movements for a passable high score.
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameSpot,54,While the online play is merely average at best its single-player play as well as its overall production values present themselves as seriously subpar.
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameZone,60,Some of the individual aspects of the game need to be reworked simply because they seem forced. The game strives to attain a lofty place but comes up a little short.
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Operation Sports,68,Sluggish at best and the controls leave a lot to be desired. Very often this game looks like it is moving at half speed and you never get that visual feeling of speed that you get from other titles.
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,GameSpot,63,Despite a slick presentation and several clearly enjoyable moments Salt Lake fails to capture the magnitude of this periodic winter spectacle and is in reality an entertaining yet brief whirl through just a fraction of the events you might expect.
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,PlayStation Universe,60,Calvino Noir starts off strong with a great setting and cast of characters but finds itself almost totally crippled on account of its heavily flawed stealth mechanics; a tragically missed opportunity.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,60,A strict time limit also detracts from whats otherwise a fun game. [Nov 2008 p.104]
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,Gamers.at,69,A downright frightening army of bugs both scares away any potential fan of Gothic and eliminates any fun that could have been had with the game. [Issue#17]
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Everyeye.it,60,Quotation forthcoming.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,NZGamer,60,If however youre after something inoffensive to entertain the youngsters without having to explain about death the birds and the bees or any other adult themes you could do worse.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,59,Has its shining moments of fun but these precious moments are overshadowed by a far greater evil--terrible level design and slow-as-molasses controls.
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Official Xbox Magazine,61,Its fundamentals are solid enough but too bland and redundant. [Jan 2003 p.78]
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,Electric Playground,55,The problem is much of it is done so darned sloppily.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Meristation,60,Bombshell is an old school action game. It is fun and has a couple of good ideas but it has a lot of mistakes too. A boring interface a wrong camera.
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,Games Master UK,53,Though it can pack a punch this lacks the finesse to tell the subversive war story its aiming for. [Sept 2014 p.74]
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,Cynamite,60,Terminator: Salvation is a run-of-the-mill game adaption of a successful movie brand. Overall okay but way too short and without any highlights or variety.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,360 Gamer Magazine UK,60,And while it’s a solid enough shooter that’ll largely cure the itch for frag-heads it just fails to do anything to particularly excite.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Multiplayer.it,55,Star Trek does a good job in terms of script and atmosphere and its decent on long-distance gunplay. But the overall experience is poor and unpolished.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GamePro,70,Its fun enough but its definitely not dangerous.
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,IGN,55,A game that’s probably better left to pen and paper. The game offers solid variety and decent puzzle design but at the end of the day you’re still doing with a controller that which is much easier and just as rewarding with a pencil.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Vandal,70,The best thing we can say about its campaign is that it works as a tutorial. The multiplayer mode is the key of this title but you need to understand how it really works to make the most of it.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,DarkStation,60,In the case of Everreach: Project Eden some mechanical issues with AI or balance can be patched which other problems are more in the realm of aesthetics and direction and are probably doomed to never go away. There’s nothing wrong with a game having a clear inspiration — most every game does — but failing to innovate on that model can result in what we have here a product that feels like an unconvincing imitation.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Blood Knights is too easy to ever become actively irritating but its deficit of danger makes it too darn dull to hold even a devoted horror nut’s attention for long. Perhaps it’s a blessing then that the whole ho-hum campaign clocks in at just four hours.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,My Gamer,56,All in all there’s very little reason to get Digimon World: Data Squad. Between the simplistic-yet-frustrating battle system and the absolutely terrible graphics there just isn’t anything positive to say about the game.
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,GamingTrend,50,Just do yourself a favor skip this game and go have fun with the real thing.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,MS Xbox World,65,Upon first sight and play this game can be judged quite easily as a bog standard mediocre racing frenzy game any excuse for a bit of chaos.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Games (Russia),55,Even if you are a Ghostbusters fan Sanctum of Slime is still difficult to recommend – it hardly contains any fanservice at all. [May 2011 p.81]
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,Digital Chumps,68,Its a manufactured experience thats still more superficial than engrossing but its a step in the right direction.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GamingXP,64,If you like epic storytelling skip this one. The KI is lame and doesnt motivate you at all but the multiplayer is fun for a few hours.
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,69,Only a select few will be hooked for more than a few seasons. John Deere Harvest in the Heartland is extremely addictive but also extremely frustrating – not because the game is challenging or cheap but because of the inexcusable issues that prevent it from reaching its full potential.
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Overall it makes for a slightly better game than Pac-Man and Ms Pac-Man though thats not saying much. [Feb 2007 p.101]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Absolute Games,50,A more experienced studio could have made lemonade from these licensed lemons and turn the final chapter into a good action shooter. Unfortunately the team at EA Bright Light had neither time nor experience.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Nintendo Insider,50,Putting it simply there is still fun to be had with FIFA 20 Legacy Edition and playing against others online is still a joy. Nevertheless charging full whack for a game when absolutely no effort went into is out of order. Simply ask yourself this are new kits and some roster changes worth over £40 to you? If you answered yes then you have too much money.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameSpy,60,Youll have to deal with a clunky interface and menu silly single-player missions brain-dead A.I. bizarre vehicle physics horrible net code dull graphics and sound and more bugs than a Georgia swamp in June.
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,PlayStation Universe,60,Spuds Unearthed has a lot of cool elements but they unfortunately don’t add up to a very compelling game. Plagued by overly complex interface elements and a very flimsy structure the core gameplay just isn’t interesting enough to keep players coming back for more.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,GRYOnline.pl,65,Hatred is a very playable game for fans of adrenaline and bloody thrills although the content of the game is a bit controversial. The game could be longer more diverse and better optimized (Unreal Engine 4 is hungry for power). And given the overall quality Hatred did not deserve all the media buzz surrounding its development and most likely it wont be remembered in a few years time.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,AceGamez,50,Flushed Away isnt a terrible game but it does nothing to encourage me to go and see the film again and tarnishes what is easily one of the funniest films of the year.
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Everyeye.it,60,A clear step backwards compared to its predecessor.
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,VideoGamer,60,The gameplay works but the simple presentation and general lack of polish unfortunately relegate the game to something only a very small minority will enjoy.
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Vandal,56,A disappointing game that although succeeds in being a game for all types of public is too repetitive and has a very limited cooperative gameplay.
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,IGN,45,So dont bother volunteering for any extra chores around the house to earn money for this one. You might have more fun just actually mowing the yard.
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,65,Unfortunately the end result is a little more Rambo a lot less Rocky. Its going to take a rethinking to pull the 3D brawler out of its me too phase and Streetwise certainly isnt helping.
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,AceGamez,60,Zathura isnt a particularly bad title; it just lacks anything that puts it above most other recent releases.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Everyeye.it,60,The most interesting feature is in fact the cross save that allows you to play indifferently on Switch or mobile devices.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,NintendoWorldReport,50,If youre thirsting for some Pac-Man partying Id go out and find the Wii version as its more accessible and for petes sake the game was clearly designed for the Wii.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,PSM3 Magazine UK,61,Slow-witted camera idiotic targeting system and abysmal vehicle sections. [Oct 2009 p.82]
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,Games Master UK,57,Some good ideas and lush graphics marred by bad game design. [Apr 2007 p.66]
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,Push Square,50,Super Dungeon Bros is a strange case. Its a pretty good dungeon crawler with decent variety in its gameplay and enough of a fun factor in its scrappy multiplayer to keep you interested. However the rock theme is underplayed; it lends the game some personality but is largely ignored leading to a muddled presentation. Some bugs also hold it back and the online side isnt very healthy right now but this could still be a fun distraction in couch co-op with a few friends.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,XGN,60,While Omerta has a great gangster style with the black and white photos and jazz music the gameplay itself feels more like work than playing a videogame. The animations in the fighting scenes are stiff and the only thing that changes when your influence on Atlantic City grows are the emblems above the houses. All missions start up slow and especially in the first few hours you are constantly waiting for your henchmen to finish their task.
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,Pocket Games,60,A so-so system that doesnt offer enough action to counter the lack of depth. [Summer 2003 p.49]
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GameSpot,55,Things just dont feel quite right and even if you like the controls the AI still cheats too much the same boring combinations still lead to wins and crowd involvement still takes precedence over inherent skill.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Vandal,55,This new Star Wars videogame doesnt make the most of the new generation power but also is a boring and dull action game with no variety in its contents.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,LaPS4,68,Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z gets to the point: action zombies and katanas for hackn slash lovers delight. Team Ninja and comcept managed to avoid making a boring game although Yaiba is perhaps quite short and suffers from a lack of variety.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GotNext,50,Even with a solid multiplayer though theres no reason for Americas Army: True Soldiers to be priced and marketed in the same class as other AAA FPS games available on the Xbox 360.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,60,It is a shame that the game is not as good as the movie it is based on. This is a simple and repetitive shooter that offers little incentive for those players who dont follow the adventures of the young wizard.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Worth Playing,50,It is a great disappointment that The Golden Compass for the NDS should be so sub-par.
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,63,Quite why they didnt simply make a new Myst specifically for the DS is the real mystery. [Feb 2008 p.84]
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,JeuxActu,65,If youre coming here for the gameplay forget Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 as nothing has evolved on that topic for the last decade. If you want to peep at sexy girls youre in the right place as everything was made with this goal in mind. A game to store on the ecchi shelf.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,God is a Geek,65,It’s largely the same hilarious gory surgery sim you know and love but its mechanics dont translate well to VR.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameSpot,58,Playing Exotica requires very little skill or finesse but for the casual gamer who doesnt want to commit lots of time to racing a track thats not really a bad thing.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Game Informer,58,Movement feels floaty hit detection and collision issues are everywhere and enemy AI is painfully stupid. [Jan 2005 p.118]
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Generación Xbox,50,With the original premise of being able to use the hordes of zombies in your favor to massacre on the enemy comes Dead Alliance. A competitive shooter in which you can test your reflexes and ability as long as you can overlook their technical and visual impairments.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,AceGamez,60,You are indeed going to need a Will of Steel to play this game merely because it takes tremendous patience to put up with terrible AI.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,LaPS4,58,Aliens are back in the videogame scene. However this game does little justice to the film series and lags behind in technical aspects when compared to other current titles. Nonetheless the different game modes –competitive and cooperative– will guarantee the fun that the solo campaign is lacking.
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,MondoXbox,55,It sports the charismatic characters from the movie but lacks in variety and player satisfaction. Avoidable.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,9Lives,59,Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes looks like a previous-gen title and doesnt convince content-wise either. A lousy camera stubborn controls make the eternal stream of lives a must. It feels kiddy and your friends AI is so bad that you thank the heavens for its co-op ability. With the sheer volume of hit games coming we fear that Lucas wont be able to find a lot of gamers willing to purchase this game.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,GameSpot,60,The Xbox Live Arcade release of Tron hobbles this absolute arcade classic with some technical problems.
Farscape: The Game,PC,Aug-8-2002,Red Lemon Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer,63,A must-have for hardcore fans of the show (both of them). But for anyone else itll just be a very boring extra-long episode. [Nov 2002 p.122]
Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,AceGamez,60,A disappointment considering that the Xbox PS2 and GBA versions are so much fun to blaze through.
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,Everyeye.it,57,This gardening themed spin-off carries over all the issues with the main chapter of Cooking Mama. Theres no depth in the minigames and player progression and that doesnt help an overall uninteresting offer.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Gamereactor Denmark,50,It feels as though all creativity and imagination has been shunned during development and the result is a load of lethargic combat with too many flaws and complete lack of the details and polish that define the best games of the genre.
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine,65,And while the game is generally fun its strictly for casual arcade racing-style fans. [Jan 2008 p.69]
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameZone,57,If you have to see what its about for yourself rent it before purchasing and above all else… find a friend.
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,SpazioGames,60,Naughty Bear is an amazing character in an average game. Some technical flaw and some dull mechanic ruins the appeal of the game.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Thunderbolt,60,Its at times a blissful experience and at times a total joy but at others its frustrating and shallow.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,PSX Nation,60,Supercross 2000 is just bland. The game lacks real variety.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GamesRadar+,50,While far from the worst Transformers game Rise of the Dark Sparks interesting ideas are eclipsed by bland action and frustrating design.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hobby Consolas,68,Good ideas and a fun artistic approach for a game which is sometimes boring.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,SpazioGames,50,RollerCoaster Tycoon World is a pale shadow of the past RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The rollercoaster editor works well but it is also the only good element of the game.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,DarkStation,60,Unless you’re dying for a game set in Vietnam there’s no great need to play this.
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,70,A surprisingly good instalment. Well worth a look if you see it for 20 quid or so. [Apr 2011 p.90]
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,61,Its rubbish fun. [Mar 2010 p.94]
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Gameplanet,55,NBA Live 14 delivers an unambitious sporadically exciting basketball simulation held back by its slavish adherence to replicating the televised game.
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Worth Playing,50,So yeah if you have an option skip the PS2 version for the 360 copy.
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpy,60,Chronicles has some of the most unresponsive controls Ive experienced in a long time.
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Games Master UK,50,Theres no denying that it has enough tournament action to keep easily pleased fans happy. [Oct 2012 p.92]
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,SpazioGames,60,Naughty Bear is an amazing character in an average game. Some technical flaw and some dull mechanic ruins the appeal of the game.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,55,We find a bunch of good ideas crashing among them. Its hard to recommend this game but we really hope they find the way to make it work in a possible sequel.
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Gaming Target,60,Not all of them are hits; however there are a couple of gems that deserve being rediscovered.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,55,The game lacks variety but it also doesnt outstay its welcome. If you want some laughs and dont mind that the shooting experience is average at best playing through this alien invasion is probably more entertaining than the movie and youll get some Achievements/Trophies out of it.
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameCritics,65,With its minimalist aesthetic and focus on customization and combat at the expense of all else Rengoku might leave a lot of curious PSP owners cold. But for those gamers looking for something a little further afield than the latest racing or sports update this niche experience is most definitely worth looking at.
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,Game Over Online,64,The game is flat-out broken right now and unlike Matt Hardy I don’t think the lake of reincarnation can help it. It needs some time to be fixed up and lots of it. Fortunately 2K through their WWEGames Twitter account maintains that patches are coming in the next few weeks – so if those come out and fix things up grab the game then. Until then you can safely skip 2K20 and it’s a shame because conceptually it’s got a lot of improvements – but the final product just doesn’t live up to its potential.
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,XGN,50,Mindjack teaches us that a good concept doesnt always evolve into a good game. Square Enix should really think about all the mistakes theyve made if they ever want to create a successor.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Eurogamer Italy,50,Enki is presented as a repeatable horror experience but fails both the repeatable and the horror parts. The publicized randomization system affects just the displacements of key objects and the whole experience is over in about 50 minutes far less than the price point of 10 Euros my suggest.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Game Informer,50,If theres a legend here its that this title fails to raise your heartbeat in almost any way. [Mar 2002 p.79]
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Dreamcast.net,59,Has everything needed for a great game but unfortunately fails to produce in the end.
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Games Master UK,57,A compelling enough adventure spoilt by shonky controls and shonkier visuals. [Feb 2011 p.93]
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,SpazioGames,55,We feel sorry to see that a great publisher like Namco Bandai in possession of a good license such as One Piece produced such a mediocre title which will be attractive only to the hardcore fans of the series and especially the younger among them.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,BonusStage,69,Where Game Tycoon falters is in its lack of depth and variety. Although the concept and myriad of options I described in the paragraph above are intriguing there isn’t a whole lot to it beyond clicking check boxes on the screen and managing company economics.
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,60,The chaotic levels are challenging but they become far too repetitive far too quickly.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,3DJuegos,56,Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime is recommended only for the lovers of the films with friends to play. The AI is frustrating the design really poor and repetitive. This time the Ghostbusters have failed.
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cynamite,60,The imprecise controls bad AI and a completely missing overview make this game more hassle than fun. Stormrise raises a storm – of frustration!
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GamesBeat,59,An unoriginal example of an archaic form of entertainment.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Meristation,68,A funny and interesting game based on Touhou characters which as a fighting game is really curious but lacks on its rooster with only 9 characters and contents to maintain interest on it.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Chronicles,57,A mild diversion rather than the full-blown stealth spy-thriller it could have been. At times I had fun but most of the time I was turned off by the frustrating gameplay and slow pacing of the action.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Computer Gaming World,50,Has the potential to be a truly unique sim but its got the blocky aesthetics of an edutainment title yet is too complex for junior to play on his own. [Sept 2002 p.85]
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,Four Fat Chicks,75,Still if you like sweet genteel heroes who absolutely cannot die and humorous third-person adventure games filled with inventory puzzles and devoid of gore its certainly worth the price of admission.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,Game Informer,60,The framerate chugs from time to time and the controls feel looser than the strippers at the Bada Bing. Still the story and dialogue had me laughing out loud a few times. If you are a big fan of the show it is worth a look but don’t expect much.
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,65,Unfortunately the end result is a little more Rambo a lot less Rocky. Its going to take a rethinking to pull the 3D brawler out of its me too phase and Streetwise certainly isnt helping.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,63,The game is a much better rental or title that is best left to borrowing from a friend who was fooled into buying it due to their ‘80’s nostalgia.
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,COGconnected,55,The whole affair feels sort of perfunctory.
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Nintendo Life,50,Block Factory is an attempt to do something different and it manages it competently while using some of 3DS functionality well. However more than anything its a greatest hits package of some existing block-dropping games with creation options that feel limited. With more fleshed out customisation even on a stylistic level alone it could have been something much bigger than it is.
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,3DJuegos,58,A so-so JRPG with neat ideas and a unique graphical conception but it also has lots of technical problems and annoying battles too.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Detroit Free Press,75,The things I liked about the game overwhelmed what I didnt like. If you want a high score you cant be a stiff. You have to get into the groove and use your whole body.
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,ZTGD,65,Still if you can stick with it and become accustomed to the way you are forced to rely on instinct there is a pretty fun and solid game here. The barrier to entry is just too high to recommend it to everyone.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,GamingTrend,62,Given a year or so Archlord might be a solid title. Right now though? Its not worth the money.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Nintenderos,59,The game is a failed attempt to bring back this mythical saga. The title innovates with several game modes that are affected by its bad gameplay and input lag. Also noteworthy is its poor graphic section and its acceptable sound section.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Digital Chumps,55,Graphically the game looks quite dated. The music is well bad — and the effects while capturing some of the characters’ uniqueness is still pretty flat. Likewise in general for the game while there is some fun to be had especially in local multiplayer the overall experience is more underwhelming than not. That makes this game very difficult to recommend to all but the most ardent kart racing or Nickelodeon fans. Even within those camps who are more apt to overlook flaws with NKR the experience leaves a lot to be desired.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,52,A dark fantasy adventure stripped of darkness fantasy and well adventure. [July 2009 p.71]
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,netjak,57,The concept is all there but some features such as funds management background story and sounds are only half-baked and appear as if the developers lost interest in completing the title.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,The fact that the game attempts to surpass the standard tie-in speaks volumes. [Issue#60 p.96]
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,GameZone,55,Brave is obviously designed with children new to gaming in mind but even they shouldn’t tolerate this glitchy mess. There’s a pretty good game here hiding amongst the bugs graphical issues and poorly designed platforming sequences. It’s called Brave: Search for Spirit Dancer and you can find it for a very reasonable price for the PS2.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Official Xbox Magazine,65,If you dont mind solo workouts Zumba Fitness delivers in spades. [Jan 2011 p.79]
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Da Gameboyz,56,Overall Turning Point: Fall of Liberty is game which had some fantastic ideas and concepts. Unfortunately the great ideas did not transform into a solid shooter.
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,63,As far as mini-games on Wii go Family Party: 30 Great Games is an above average effort. That may not be saying much but if youre looking for something to entertain your friends on occasion you certainly could do a whole lot worse.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,58,Its impossible to recommend as a purchase due to a handful of flaws that have a major negative impact on the gameplay. At On the same token its bursting with great platforming ideas that rival gamings top franchises. If youre curious we suggest a rental but beware of inevitable frustration.
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,BaziCenter,55,Jujubee S.A.’s efforts in creating a different narrative style is admirable and they did a great job in designing a solid atmosphere and a dynamic environment. But when it comes to presenting a video game inspired by real historical events KURSK falls a little bit short and besides that the core gameplay is not really entertaining either.
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Xbox Tavern,61,Hello Neighbor is a confused game that doesn’t do much to entice those that are new to the experience. There’s a lack of structure in both the story and the gameplay. This alone makes much of the pace rely heavily on trial and error and although there’s a wide variety of different puzzles to work out the delivery of each of them can be mind boggling if you miss out on a single detail.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,GameZone,69,Steel Horizon works well as a mainstream DS release but does not have the intransigent components of a cutthroat strategy game. Its combat is too simplistic.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,60,Part of me feels the need to defend this game as I find myself almost feeling sorry for it. Its like a well-meaning kid that because of inadequate parents didnt get the break it deserves.
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,3DJuegos,64,Rock Revolution is basically what you’d expect from a musical game at medium level.
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Multiplayer.it,50,Like the original version MX vs ATV Supercross Encore is really boring and the lack of innovation makes it quite pointless.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,Game Chronicles,55,With Fatal Conspiracy it is as if Telltale forgot what made Sam & Max Monkey Island and Wallace and Gromit so successful in the console world and it comes off as a sorry port of a lackluster PC game.
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,NZGamer,60,The visuals are generally clean and bright while the audio is made up of your generic menu music and a series of beeps and tones when instructed to move or perform a certain action.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,PSFocus,68,The television series is great but the game isn’t. The main aspects are stealth gameplay fighting and quick time events. Only the stealth part works in this game the other two don’t. The graphics are nice and the audio is fine. The voice-acting could have been better but overall it’s good to listen to.
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,Electronic Gaming Monthly,55,You can drop a few quarters at the local arcade or half a Benjamin for the home version and still beat the game in one sitting. [June 2002 p.120]
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Happy Puppy,50,The graphics may be lackluster but the music is worse.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Games Master UK,56,Middle-of-the-road DS gaming thats not offensive or horrible - just not very good. [May 2007 p.83]
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,TotalPlayStation,50,ArcaniA has an expansive world to explore. Unfortunately theres almost nothing of interest to find there and youll likely leave unsatisfied.
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Game Chronicles,65,A lack of imagination in terms of game mechanics doomed it to the rental bin and not the permanent collection.
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,SomosXbox,60,With a great base that reminds Top Spin Tennis World Tour presents more errors than they should with a game that seems in progress.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,AtomicGamer,60,A hastily made not much fun not worth the money movie add-on. Youre better off buying a box of Hellboy Cornflakes.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,3DAvenue,60,The problem with Spiderman 2 is its lack of depth.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Gamer's Pulse,66,While the actually gameplay is without much issue it borrows heavily from other games particularly the Rogue Squadron series making its mission-based gameplay highly unoriginal and trite.
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,Gaming Nexus,58,Iron Man 2 is better than your average movie game but its still rather short and limited in scope. The visuals are great and the controls work well but I have a feeling HVS couldve done a lot more with the property if they had more time to work on the game.
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,360 Gamer Magazine UK,50,Winter Sports 2009 simply does the job. It is easy to play and offers a fair amount of entertainment – and at a welcome bargain price that will appeal to many sports fans. However with poor presentation values and only a handful of really fun or challenging events it’s a game you’ll be unlikely to dig out on a regular basis unless you’ve an unquenchable thirst for competition or a few mates up for some multiplayer action.
Deca Sports 3,Wii,Oct-26-2010,Hudson | NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Sports | General | General,Nintendojo,58,There is some fun to be had in Deca Sports 3 and its a sure-fire hit at parties. Not a hard-core sports simulator but some lesser-known sports that dont get the full retail package are also nice to find here.
Rugby 18,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Koch Media,Sports | Team | Rugby,Gameblog.fr,50,Rugby 2018 is lacking the depth to reach the level of the best sports games.
Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,eToychest,70,My advice: Set aside a larger budget for voice acting and make sure the environments are as interactive toward the end as they are in the beginning. For players dont expect a classic because you wont find this game fulfilling that need. But as long as you set your expectations a bit lower you should be entertained.
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,Yahoo!,70,The lack of a mid-game save aside PoA is great fun to play - not only does it have the necessary hook to keep you interested in what happens next but it manages to perfectly reproduce the atmosphere of the Apes films.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,52,A twisted shrine to mediocrity. [Aug 2010 p.104]
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,Game Informer,50,My time with Wayward Manor felt more like a trial than a macabre puzzle adventure about a haunted house. Wayward Manor isn’t frightening but it sure scared me away.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GameSpot,50,A lot of little flaws suck most of the fun out of this take on radio-controlled car racing.
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,Eurogamer,50,American Football fans looking for a cheap retro fix will probably squeeze 400 points worth of fun out of Cyberball before déjà vu sets in but the absence of any real multiplayer challenge means any amusement comes with a built-in expiry date one that arrives sooner than youd like. Its no Speedball thats for sure.
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,70,Transformers is a funny rail shooter with nice graphics and four different weapons you can use to shot your enemies during two available campaigns. The problem is the game is way too easy as you can finish it in a few hours. It also lacks any form of progression or power-ups.
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,VGPub,64,If you have Live this can be an incredibly enjoyable game once you get used to the profane and immature nature of players that frequent the lobbies.
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,GameStar,58,Its very short but we still had to force ourselves to play on. Dumb non-stop battles oversized dungeons and a tiring story is basically all there is. Think twice before buying this one.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Vandal,65,Because of the wide RPG library in PS2 and PSP and sspecially in PS2 during his ten years of life Mana Khemia can sneak modestly between hardcore Atelier Iris fans. There are not many surprises in this game which is too conservative but can offer some hours of fun.
Damnation,PC,May-22-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameStar,58,Technically Damnation is not up to date it looks like a game from the 20th century with overly complicated controls. Its a shame because it could have been so much better. Blue Omega please try again.
One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,GamingTrend,60,One Way Trip is the story of a definite and unjust death sentence told amongst an eerily realistic dissociative drug trip backdrop that freaked my delicate mind more than once. Basic disjointed and tragic this game strips away almost all functions of a game and makes you a decision maker. Plagued with crashes that can cause fatal errors One Way Trip does have some improvements to make. With those improvements and time One Way Trip is sure to become a cult favorite of the PlayStation 4 age.
Alien Blast: The Encounter,PC,Feb-9-2004,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Game Chronicles,60,Aliens Blast: The Encounter never makes any pretense toward being anything other than it is a simple straightforward shoot ‘em up extravaganza and depending upon whether or not this is your cup of tea will be the major factor in your purchase decision.
Robot Arena,PC,Apr-1-2001,Gabriel Interactive,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Breeding/Constructing,IGN,43,While its prettier than most budget titles it also suffers from the vacancy that so often comes with nice looking people dogs or mechanical monsters. It looks great standing still but give it a complicated task and it all goes to pieces.
Rally Challenge 2000,Nintendo 64,Jun-30-2000,Europress,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,IGN,60,Its not a miserable game by any stretch -- the bad fogging can be worked around the sad audio can be drowned out without missing anything and the lacking tracks are at least true to the sport.
Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,n-Revolution Magazine UK,60,More suited to a younger audience. It wears thin after a while but cheap thrills can easily tempt you back. [Issue#25 p.77]
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,Absolute Games,62,7554 deserves brownie points for trying to break the mold. Instead of the overused US invasion of 1965 the developers chose 1954 – the final year of the First Indochina War. Too bad this is the only original idea in the entire game. 7554 is just a carbon copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare sans multiplayer.
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Pelit (Finland),58,A poor excuse for a racing game. The only good thing is the wheel that comes with the game. Using it is actually quite fun. [Jan 2007]
Timeline,PC,Nov-12-2000,Timeline Computer Entertainment,Action | General | General,GameSpy,56,Sadly much of the game feels as if it were rushed and the games story and characters are presented so poorly as to all but ruin what could have an enjoyable experience.
MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,Extreme Gamer,56,Ubisoft had great hopes and ambition when planning and creating MotionSports Adrenaline but when an fast paced extreme sports game has unresponsive controls it leaves you feeling very let down and frustrated.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Wii,Nov-16-2010,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,60,As movie tie-ins go this is a decent effort - but youd need to have downed your body weight in butter-beer to claim that it didnt need a little more care attention and (perhaps) experience in its creation.
The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Xbox Magazine,60,Theres no reason to play The Golden Compass unless the movie or book absolutely monopolizes your imagination. [Jan 2008 p.62]
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Destructoid,50,Gungrave like when it debuted over a decade ago is an acquired taste.
Waking,PC,Jun-18-2020,Jason Oda,Action | General,TheGamer,70,Waking probably wont resonate with most - its far too oblique and mixed for most and its complicated art for weirdos. But as one of those weirdos I found Jason Odas unique thesis on life death and everything between the two to be an engaging engrossing and challenging experience.
JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,Trickstar Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,50,From the first mission to the last J.A.S.F. is left to rot by the arcadey and capable Ace Combat for sheer thrills embarrassed by the variety of missions offered in H.A.W.X. 2 and technically outperformed by the more serious IL-2 Sturmovik. [February 2012 p.76]
Taito Legends Power-Up,PSP,May-17-2007,Empire Oxford,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Boomtown,60,Cheap cheerful and a good laugh even if it does lack a little longevity.
Rapala Tournament Fishing!,Wii,Nov-22-2006,MagicWand,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Electric Playground,50,Rapala Tournament Fishings controls just arent intuitive and worse theyre not especially responsive.
DARK,PC,Jul-3-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Multiplayer.it,55,DARK is a stealth game with some nice ideas and an interesting story but it suffers from poor IA and repetitive gameplay.
Seduce Me,PC,Jan-2-2013,None,Strategy | General | General,NZGamer,54,My main issue with Seduce Me is that despite the invitation that is right there in the title of the game none of the characters want to cooperate. No matter how high your score with a character - and hence your implied closeness to that character - they still play as though they want you to fail.
Lets Fish! Hooked On,PlayStation Vita,Jan-29-2013,SIMS,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Gaming Age,50,Considering it has no competition… Lets Fish! Hooked On is surely the best fishing game available for the PlayStation Vita and fans of the genre (like myself) may enjoy it for a little while. Even with the Vitas bells and whistles however it fails to live up to the Sega-style arcade fishing games of old.
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,PC,Oct-17-2006,Apeiron,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | General | Modern,Armchair Empire,50,My instinct is that despite BE5’s flaws it might have potential for modding or for higher quality sequels.
Turtle Tale,3DS,May-22-2014,Saturnine Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Life,50,At its low price point Turtle Tale is an entirely functional platforming adventure from a small indie studio that you can breeze through in a day or two.
Street Supremacy,PSP,Feb-28-2006,Genki,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Game Informer,68,The structure is here for a great title but it doesnt help when half the games gone up in smoke. [Apr 2006 p.135]
Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,Cheat Code Central,62,The game will be delightfully nostalgic to gamers of old and should be tried by anyone who is too young to remember it. Its an important part of gaming history one that will make a fine addition to your Xbox LIVE Arcade game collection.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Game Informer,63,Nothing more than an unpolished but promising rhythm title. [Feb 2004 p.103]

007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,PSX-Sense.nl,60,A fun shooter collecting the best moments out of five classic James Bond movies on one disc. Then again the gameplay has aged the graphics are terrible and both loading times and enemy AI are major disappointments. There are better alternatives on the shooter market thats for sure.
Mall Tycoon,PC,Feb-3-2002,Holistic Design | Inc.,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,47,Building your own galleria is fun for a bit but because its such a simple economic simulation theres just no staying power here.

Clash of the Titans,PlayStation 3,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Play UK,65,It isnt great but its quite a fun distraction and far better than most other movie-games. [Issue#193 p.95]
0 Day Attack on Earth,Xbox 360,Dec-23-2009,Gulti,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,My Gamer,58,While the concept of the game seems to be sound a Geometry Wars inspired co-op shooter; everything seems to work against it especially the price.
Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,52,A twisted shrine to mediocrity. [Aug 2010 p.104]
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,Screen Rant,50,Dollhouse begins with a lot of potential but after a few levels of repetitive gameplay the horror elements start to lose their impact. What starts as a trip through a disturbed mind quickly becomes monotonous and Maries story suffers as a result.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Game Over Online,60,This game is aggressive and unstoppable in its mediocrity.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,NF Magazine,50,In the end Nickelodeon Kart Racers is just kind of passable (and compared to others Im being generous with it). [Issue #37 – January/February 2019 p. 75]
Way of the Dogg,Xbox 360,May-3-2013,Echo Peak,General | Action | General,Destructoid,55,Way of the Dogg is a wasted opportunity. As someone who consumes pretty much all the media on offer in this game it doesnt even appeal to me which should tell you that somethings wrong. Its a shame because with an M rating and a little more plot tweaking this could have been something special. Someone call the popo -- this game just did a 187 on your wallet foo.
4PM,PC,Jul-9-2014,Bojan Brbora,Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,VideoGamer,50,The brain behind (Bojan Brbora) 4PM deserves a lot of credit for what he has attempted to achieve but when all is said and done this feels more like a proof of concept than a fully realised game.
WWII Aces,Wii,Mar-21-2008,Arcade Moon,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Game Chronicles,50,This is a third-party game with not very high aspirations. Don’t let the Wing Series emblem on the cover fool you into thinking that it is official or historically accurate or anything of the sort.
Delta Force: Xtreme 2,PC,May-27-2009,NovaLogic,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,Thunderbolt,50,Xtreme 2 succeeds as a budget game - it just doesn’t cater to any audience in particular. A lack of focus is the overarching problem with this decent budget title.
Slain!,PC,Mar-24-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,4Players.de,55,The discrepancy between visual and game design couldn’t be bigger. While the pixelart is simply beautiful throughout the fighting mechanics and collision detection need an overhaul.
Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Riot Pixels,48,It is hardly a spy thriller but rather a madhouse with disguises and murders so it’s best to avoid this chapter of Mr. Strogov’s life altogether.
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,NintendoWorldReport,70,Its a cleverly designed game that could use a bit more polish.

Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,Cheat Code Central,60,The only adventure youll have with it is trying to get your money back should you be so unlucky to have purchased it.
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Happy Puppy,50,If you havent seen the game prepare to witness some of the weakest graphics this side of the millenium. The 3D characters are nothing but big blocks of pixel.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,GamingXP,48,Naval Assault – The killing tide should have been an arcade game. It would have been a good advice to 505 Games to do so. But they decided to release it as a full-price game. But for this it is too simple and its gameplay is too stupid.
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,Gaming Nexus,65,With so many great ideas in The Chaos Engine it pains me to admit that I didnt have much fun. I love the world it creates the diverse enemies and the science fiction story but cant get past the punishing difficulty and cheap hits. This enhanced version needs a few more enhancements to be ready for the 21st century!
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendo Power,60,The gamplay is simple but well-executed and just as much fun as it was in the eraly 80s. [June 2004 p.121]
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,Computer and Video Games,50,Its banality is perfect. Even an inexplicable side-scrolling fish-tank shoot-em-up level that pops up between the soporific platform stages fails to raise an eyebrow.
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,DC Swirl,60,Theres plenty to enjoy about Ducati Racing which ultimately picks up for all of the minor gripes.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,ZTGD,65,I felt there was very little content here to keep me coming back other than the novel feeling of the bow and arrow which is absolutely amazing in fact. Aside from this and maybe the visual style I don’t see a huge reason I’d return to it especially if other games adopt this bow and arrow feel. Yet at the same time I can’t complain it’s a simply game with colorful graphics and is appropriate for players of all ages. Just don’t expect it to kill hours of time.
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,Gamers Depot,60,It’s not that it’s that bad of a game it’s just that most of what’s under the hood on this one has been done before.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,ZTGD,60,While most will likely balk at the idea of spending 800 Microsoft Space Bucks for this title I find it quite refreshing and reminiscent of the PSOne days where devs took chances on titles that didn’t really fit a genre.
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Play (Poland),60,Vietnam veteran Joey Verolla is a really really tough guy who can not only lift two kalashnikovs but also fire them simultaneously. And he does this trick with any other handgun even SPAS. If it doesnt properly impress his enemies its because they are brainless. As is the entire game - despite some interesting mission designs quite amusing (and gory) finishing sequences and virtually useless ability to seek cover by putting your back to the wall this shooter is as simple as some precursors of the genre. [March 2008]
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Nintendo Life,50,Chronus Arc is competent RPG that fails to deliver on one of the most important aspects of the genre: the story.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Revolution,50,Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DONT KNOW! does a great job of managing and working with the story characters and feel of the franchise but unfortunately doesnt have the gameplay to match especially at a $40 retail price. If youre interested in the narrative and the chance to play as your favorite characters wait for the price to come down to $15-20 more in keeping with the kind of downloadable title this game feels like.
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,ZTGD,53,However if you are a fan of classic arcade driving games like Segas aforementioned cabbie title then you may want to check Mayhem out. It can definitely entertain even if only for minutes at a time.
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,IGN,54,Protothea is a totally hardcore shooter that while challenging just isnt very interesting. The one unique aspect is its control scheme but I cant say its an improvement over two analog sticks. The game doesnt look that great doesnt sound that great and doesnt offer much creativity.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Chronicles,57,How much you enjoy that gameplay is going to be based on your love of the genre and your tolerance for numerous glitches. Hopefully a patch is in the works to improve things or at least fix what’s broke.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GameStar,53,The sequel to the controversial Vietnam first person shooter abandoned the use of torture and atrocities to civilians. It also abandoned good graphics atmosphere and almost everything else needed for a good game. Dumb enemies exaggerated splatter effects boring levels and graphics right from the last century - Shellshock 2 has nothing interesting to offer.
Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,AceGamez,50,With presentation thats lacking flair no tournament options sub-standard opponent AI no rule variations other than 8 or 9 ball pool and limited stimuli to continue playing Frontline Studios appear to have just gone through the motions with Actua Pool.
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpy,73,If you enjoy puzzle-oriented RPGs or the Freedom series you might enjoy this game. Otherwise it should stay on the shelf.
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Play Magazine,50,This sequel simply didnt need to happen. [June 2007 p.80]
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Games Master UK,55,Fans will get a kick out of it but anyone else would be advised to try the glorious cartoon instead. [Jan 2014 p.83]
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,45,Xiaolin Showdown has the elements of a good game but the execution is so sloppy and shallow that it ends up falling flat.
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,50,Painkiller Hell & Damnation is a short unattractive beast that will sink its claws into you if you give it half a chance. But be warned: it could also be a throwback that may fly right over the head of a modern FPS gamer. [September 2013 p76]
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,PSX-Sense.nl,50,Fans of farming might enjoy this but if youre not particularly fond of agriculture we wouldnt recommend this game. To be sure its an incredibly deep experience but sheer depth does not prevent a title like this from growing stale within a couple of hours. Repetitive gameplay outright bizarre physics and mediocre visuals dont help either.
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,IGN Italia,60,Escape Dead Island is a decent game but nothing more (though also nothing less).
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Meristation,45,Inner Chains has been a big opportunity wasted. Its true that its a relatively small indie studio that its a project with a very specific vision and that has really new features that are also great but the final result has more the look of an unfinished beta than a totally finished game.
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,A little bit ropey. [Issue#52 p.104]
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Game Informer,60,If you’re going to get one of these go for the faster-paced Beta Wave but watch out for that nasty addition game.
MTV Sports: Skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald,PlayStation,Sep-12-2000,Darkblack,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GameZone,70,Very entertaining.
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,48,Mamodo Fury packs a number of gameplay modes and plenty of familiar characters but it all feels wasted on this shallow and frustrating fighting game.
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,IGN,55,Just some generic cars running over some ho-hum zombies. The controls could be tighter and no one seems to be playing online but the game succeeds at giving you a license to run over the undead. It just isnt that exciting.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,GameFocus,60,Despite the stiff stealth/fighting mechanics the mission’s linearity and the trial/error experience Prison Break: The Conspiracy somehow ended up being enjoyable. I’m sure Zootfly could have done something much better but in the end the final product was purposely done with the intention of giving the fans something incredibly easy to play.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,47,The problems start with control. The response isnt razor sharp the special moves arent spectacular and the Netbuster specials are too easy to pull off. [Jan 2004 p.73]
Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu,Game Boy Advance,Nov-24-2003,Webfoot Technologies,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameBiz,65,It has its ups and downs but the special moves look absolutely gorgeous and very much like they do in the cartoon series and the in-flight fighting is an experience not to be missed on a hand-held.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,60,Brian and Stewie are funny and there are plenty of gags but the gameplay is nothing crazy and the levels arent super-intriguing.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Maxi Consolas (Portugal),50,As in many of these cases if you liked the movie you’ll probably enjoy revisiting the story and characters. But that doesn’t make it a good game. [Jan 2008]
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Hardcore Gamer,60,Had there been some polish in some of the controls an added depth to the story mode and more matchmaking online Scourge: Outbreak would have been one of the biggest downloadable surprises this year. Still for around $10 it’s worth playing — especially with friends.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,Worth Playing,60,As stated earlier MotionSports: Play For Real is more of a complementary title to Kinect Sports than a competitive one.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,GamePro,70,The gameplay boils down to a simplistic mix of platform jumping and enemy bashing with a good dose of item collection thrown in. It wont tax your reflexes or your brain which is why the game is perfect for younger gamers; players who grew up with the cartoons as I did will also experience a nice feeling of nostalgia as they play.
Real Steel,Xbox 360,Oct-12-2011,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Real Steals fisticuffs are a half step above the usual movie-based dreck but the constant rattle of a beggars tin cup in your face only grows more distasteful over time.
Soldier Elite,PC,May-29-2006,Metropolis Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,46,Soldier Elite wants very badly to be a stealth action game but it lacks any understanding of the subtlety and nuance that are essential to the genre.
Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,ZTGD,69,For what the game does it works relatively well. There are a few hitches here and there but it was never enough to have me quit playing the game. For a cheaper title you can definitely do a lot worse than Deep Black. If youre looking for a decent little shooter and dont mind a few inconsistencies here and there you might want to check this game out.
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,60,The game is thirty minutes long and costs ten dollars. Thats thirty three cents a minute to play this game. Youll get better value out of a psychic hotline.
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,Meristation,60,Montagues Mount promises a journey through the mind of a tortured man by the shores of an Irish island and endless emotions. Actually we got an adventure burdened by its design flaws and soft script although it has potential for the future.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,BonusStage,60,It follows the beloved storyline with a wonderful cinematic flair top-notch audio design colorful yet simple graphics and a basic set of gameplay mechanics. However a lacking of innovation and overall gameplay and graphical polish stunt the games full potential and leave it as a just-above-average title only fans of the material and/or genre will find any value in.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,GameSpot,42,Its an idea that has been tried before and done better.
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Xbox Magazine,55,Crusade sports some solid ideas (a cursed realm you can switch to on the fly is a neat concept that doesnt quite work) but sadly it suffers most from ho-hum pacing and rinse-repeat gameplay.
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Game Chronicles,56,I was left slightly underwhelmed and rather bored with the entire experience. Sure Ultimate Beach Soccer is new and different and that might be enough to get a few curious gamers to check it out but I doubt it will keep their interest for more than a day or two.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,50,Commentary will soon get on your tits. [Feb 2006 p.94]
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,IGN,50,The Wii controls add a thin veil to make you feel like youre not just mashing A the entire time but you are. This game is literally you punching as your favorite member of the Fantastic Four for hours on end.
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,Gaming Age,42,Unless you have a strange Transformers fetish it’s a game that you can easily skip.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,Deeko,70,While the control and gameplay are dead on the repetition and lack of story simply hurt.
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Daily Radar,50,When you consider the Army Men franchises extraordinary commitment to ordinariness then it shouldnt be a surprise that the game is so utterly banal.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PC,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Gamer 2.0,52,After playing through just a bit of Turning Point we were completely disappointed. The old feeling to it completely ruined the original concept.
25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gaming Target,60,There are a couple of interesting concepts included in the package (customization items for your online avatar are awarded for completing single-player secondary objectives) but the game as a whole never rises above mediocrity.
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gamer 2.0,52,A decent racer that doesn’t really do anything different enough to warrant passing on any of the quality racing experiences that the PSP offers.
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gamers' Temple,55,Doctor Who fans will get a lot out of the story and excellent voice acting and motion capture but only gamers with a high tolerance for frustration will find the fun buried in this one.
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Da Gameboyz,50,Although the visuals and sound are solid enough the gameplay fails as the racing view itself is very strange and the controls are too simplistic and too dull to make it an exciting game.
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,Forbes,65,While the team’s modest size is betrayed by the game’s myriad technical issues what they’ve attempted here is quite honestly laudable. Maybe they’d do well to view this as a functional blueprint for a future project that builds on the good work that’s been accomplished—I know I’ll be waiting for what’s next. Here’s hoping the bugs get patched out and that we eventually get a Troll and I sequel one that focuses on cleaner controls and a more emotionally engaging story.
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,GamingTrend,50,Senran Kagura Reflexions is an Ecchi dating sim game that in reality is a touching and squeezing simulator. The gameplay feels pervy at times and gets repetitive and boring fairly quickly. There are no visual issues and motion controls make things more interesting but it unfortunately isnt enough to make it entertaining.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,51,Nostalgia-seekers need not apply: this is easily outdone by the 13-year-old game from which it is derived. A shame. [Christmas 2012 p.111]
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Game Informer,60,If you’re going to get one of these go for the faster-paced Beta Wave but watch out for that nasty addition game. [Feb. 2007 p.111]
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,The games simplicity makes this a questionable choice for anyone over 8 but young kids will likely enjoy it. [Jan 2005 p.106]
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,4Players.de,58,Two worlds collide: On one side you get loads of bizarre enemies and hair-raising ideas. On the other you get frustrated by old-fashioned mission design poor AI and boring gunfights. Like Stewie says: Again! Again! I love repetition!
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Console Gameworld,57,Kids and adults will find themselves frustrated with bad camera angles and dimwitted Oompa Loompas.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Game Informer,58,You know the drill: extremely linear level designs that stitch together corridors open areas and dull objectives with all the refinement and subltlety of a drunken quilting circle. [Mar 2006 p.100]
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,God is a Geek,40,The Switch port has almost everything going wrong with poor visuals a higher price point than the other platforms and poor use of Switch specific features. In its current state you’re better off either buying it on another platform if you must have it or skip it altogether. I hope the developers can either improve the visuals through patches or work on.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,GamePro,50,This game just lacks in too many ways to cost this much. Should have just been a 400 point game.
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Nintendo Life,60,Its a shame its so brief (about the length of an actual horror film) so we cannot recommend paying full price but if you can get it for a budget price itll make for some frightening fun at your next party.
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,3DJuegos,59,Thor is a very basic game made only for fans of the film.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,45,As a game its just ok but there are some quite frustrating issues –as the cover system– that end up weakening the final experience.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,PC,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | Shooter | General | First-Person | Modern,GameStar,61,Its quite short. The credits were rolling after less than seven hours. The weak presentation is just as annoying as the question why the game deprives the player of lots of exciting situations. There are better games of the genre like Rainbow Six: Vegas.
Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamer's Pulse,50,Replay value of Scream Arena is low due to its repetitive yet enjoyable gameplay.
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,Quandary,80,The makers should be commended on another fine effort.
Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,Xbox 360,Feb-10-2009,Tamsoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,Game Informer,60,Its hard to know which is more laughable: Onechanbaras story of sisters who absorb zombie blood through their skin or the fact that this game is so shallow. [Apr 2009 p.81]
Tony Hawk's Motion,DS,Nov-18-2008,Creat Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Games Master UK,57,A shadow of its former success this is little more than a limited showcase for a peripheral. [Feb 2009 p.82]
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,Wii,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,1UP,42,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor isnt without its charms but its hard to believe that the younger target audience will wade through the difficulty spikes to see the convoluted narrative to its conclusion.
Cartoon Network Racing,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameDaily,60,Kids will probably love it too as well as some adults that enjoy Cartoon Networks shows and characters.
The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,NintendoWorldReport,45,The Deer God is a tough sell its visuals and music can’t help make this game any less frustrating. If you have a lot of time and more importantly a lot of patience maybe this game is good for you but as it stands I would stay clear.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,GameWatcher,57,The casual gamer won’t even dignify this with half a first glance it’s a game to remind yourself that there’s a big wide World out there and you’re missing it!
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,GameCube Europe,49,While not as bad as the majority of critics are reporting its certainly not worthy of a full price title.
Resident Evil: Survivor,PlayStation,Aug-30-2000,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,Games Radar,75,Brilliant. Youll certainly be having a bit of a laugh as well as being scared out of your pants.
Realms of Ancient War,PC,Oct-4-2012,Wizarbox,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,DarkZero,50,In conclusion Realms of War is a title that is on the lower side of average in the genre it exists in.
Inkheart,DS,Jan-12-2009,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | General | General,GamerNode,50,Not for veteran gamers. Truly engaging puzzle-solving and high quality presentation are absent from the game but its accessible control style and somewhat interesting plot make it at least playable.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,GameCrate,50,The visuals have their fair amount of issues the gameplay cant quite measure up between the frustrating missions and poorly placed slam technique and the online sessions need a serious overhaul. Its still playable and might be fun for devoted fans for the series but theres no question that a lot more polish couldve gone into Tony Hawks revival.
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,50,An expansive number of levels plenty of unlockable rewards and a variety of play options - all qualities which tend to make game compilations worth picking up in the first place - are noticeably lacking here.
Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,45,You might well opt to buy stat upgrades or temporary performance-boosting items instead for the sake of simple one-on-one multiplayer confrontations. But because stat upgrades make little difference in the field and you can carry only a single boost item at a time youre probably better off just playing something else altogether.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Nintendo Gamer,48,A pale imitation of a far more ambitious game Alone in the Dark on Wii is too higgledy-piggledy to satisfy. A handful of terrific highs cant make up for hours of lows. [Sept 2008 p.58]
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Nintendophiles,53,The graphics system works not too well but every level is playable and enjoyable if it weren’t for having to start over completely after each life.
Putty Squad,PlayStation 4,Mar-11-2014,System 3,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,50,Putty Squad is not a bad game and with the relative lack of titles currently released on the PlayStation 4 it does fill something of a void. Still platforming enthusiasts with PlayStation 4s do have access to Rayman Legends rendering it rather pointless to grab Putty Squad unless youre an absolute genre purist.
Motocross Mania 3,Xbox,Apr-27-2005,Deibus Studios,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,TeamXbox,50,The title features sub-par racing horrendous graphics lackluster audio and focuses far too much on the weapons gimmick.
Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Age,83,Even with the Crash Mode being a let down Burnout Legends is easily one of the best racers on the Nintendo DS. The fact that Criterion has put all the little nuances of the Burnout series in one little DS cart is amazing.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,Play UK,56,At best forgettable; at worst downright creepy. [Issue#192 p.89]
Battleship,Xbox 360,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Tactical,Destructoid,50,A title that isnt truly good or bad with aspects that can be fun at times yet which grow boring over the course of its 4 hour lifespan and ultimately it falls just short of being anything more than decidedly average.
Battle: Los Angeles,PC,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,55,The game lacks variety but it also doesnt outstay its welcome. If you want some laughs and dont mind that the shooting experience is average at best playing through this alien invasion is probably more entertaining than the movie and youll get some Achievements/Trophies out of it.
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,IGN,40,Its a bland and lifeless arcade shooter with repetitive gameplay and unnecessary 3D effects.
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,PC Gamer UK,56,Makes a one-man war against the armies of hell quite depressingly dull. [Christmas 2009 p.116]
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Game Over Online,50,It doesn’t feel like it’s finished and even if it were to be further refined it would just be a low-budget Gears of War-style shoot-‘em-up. There’s no reason to play it.
G.I. Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,Armchair Empire,70,I found the presentation technically impeccable but was not able to sufficiently overcome the difficulty in issuing orders and controlling the camera to derive a lot of enjoyment from the game.
Driven,PlayStation 2,Nov-6-2001,Bam Entertainment,Driving | Racing | Formula One,Game Informer,65,More fun than watching the movie that inspired it. Of course so is watching your inbred Uncle Eddie pick lint out of his navel. [Feb 2002 p.85]
Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,TeamXbox,50,When running properly Pimp my Ride is fun if you’re into the show but it will do little for the gearheads who are looking for something a little different in the racing genre. Snatch this one up if you’re really into the TV show Xzibit or outlandishly customizing cars.
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameZone,50,Nearly identical to a game that was released 3 years ago with almost minimal upgrades. Some aspects have even been taken out or downgraded.
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Games Master UK,53,Awkward design and stiff controls make Dark a royal pain in the... [Sept 2013 p.70]
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN Italia,45,A handful of interesting (although poorly developed) ideas are the only bright spots in a game that disappoints in almost every possible way. Sadly Terminal Reality offers one of the ugliest survival horror games ever.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Critical Hit,59,Intrinsic problems with some of the basics; collision detection dodgy camera and sloppy graphics ruin what could have been a far more polished experience.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,IGN,55,The repetitive enemies poor environment design and visual slowdown will turn you off so much that youd never give the franchise another chance.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Edge Magazine,50,Despite the aforementioned illusion of choice there is really only one pre-determined way to conquer a given mission each stealthy ability in reality a functional button-press to move the game along. [Apr 2007 p.87]
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Everyeye.it,50,Thor: God of Thunder is an ugly game. The gameplay mechanics do not work properly and a poor visual style subtends the entire walktrough. Boring is the only word to describe this tie-in.
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Multiplayer.it,50,Project Root connect the spirit of the classic shooter with hints of open world . But the result is too uneven because of the many flaws in graphics and game design. Its hard to recommend buying this title albeit at a fairly low price.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,GameZone,62,Solid visuals decent golf mechanics and a large assortment of prizes to collect will keep some gamers busy. The game just needs more courses and an expanded single-player mode to really make gamers come back for more.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,60,Mediocre. [Nov 2009 p.78]
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,Worth Playing,55,If you are hoping for an updated version of the exceptional Seven Kingdoms gameplay in Seven Kingdoms: Conquest you will be seriously disappointed.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Worth Playing,60,It just gets kind of boring watching the fights instead of participating in them.
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GameNow,58,Youre better off going with the pro. [Jan 2003 p.52]
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,NintendoWorldReport,50,Outbreak is sort of a fun mode but it does get old quickly and everything surrounding it is unexplained or prone to error messages and I can see it becoming kind of gross in a free-to-play way. Blades of Time is bad and you should not play it.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Planet Xbox 360,52,Rock Revolution is a disaster.
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,PSM3 Magazine UK,65,Faithful for fans low on thrills for everyone else. [July 2007 p.84]
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,COGconnected,55,All in all Heavy Fire: Red Shadow is a game that is easy to overlook and doesn’t really give you much reason not to. There’s fun to be had and it’s an easy way to waste a half hour but that’s really all you’ll be doing. With repetitive gameplay a strange storyline and a tone that oddly feels more like a recruitment video than anything else Heavy Fire seems like it probably should have stayed dormant. Seriously though if it does unlock a special invite to join the military someone please let me know!
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Weekly Famitsu,63,6 / 7 / 6 / 6 - 25 [Vol 788; 23 Jan 2004]
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,games(TM),50,Rather than being encouraged to play it often feels like Bandai Namco is actively discouraging you from Lost Swords. [Issue#148 p.124]
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Digital Chumps,45,Getting stuck in room-escape or point and click adventure games is par for the course sometimes but what DYING: Reborn does not have going for it is other strong qualities to keep things interesting and worth the effort. It wasn’t long before I resorted to a walkthrough once and then again as needed. I wasn’t compelled by the story the characters or the atmosphere. I didn’t feel any sense of tension or immersion with Mathew and his plight. The presentation of the game from graphics to on-screen font to voice-acting was very generic and lackluster too making the whole experience a struggle and not very enjoyable. Without a walkthrough I probably would not have pressed on because I just was not finding the experience worth my time and effort. If you really enjoy room escape games and puzzles DYING: Reborn at $20 or less might be worth a look but it’s hard to recommend otherwise.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Informer,55,Like a Quidditch player falling from a broomstick mid-match this installment loses all forward momentum and goes plummeting toward a faceplant at top speed.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,GameStar,49,The basic concept is solid but due to its bad implementation the game is almost a total write-off.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSM Magazine,55,Acme Arsenal has its fun moments but only if you dont think too hard. [Dec 2007 p.89]
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Happy Puppy,60,One of the deepest games ever created. Too bad all the time spent with the options couldnt have been devoted to gameplay instead.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,59,Unfortunately the inconsistent behavior of your recruits means youll spend more time fighting the interface than the Antichrist.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,1UP,42,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor isnt without its charms but its hard to believe that the younger target audience will wade through the difficulty spikes to see the convoluted narrative to its conclusion.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,PSX Nation,50,There is a brain-dead appeal to the desperate way Konami has reinvented its struggling ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding franchise into a Road Rash clone.
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IGN,65,Its a somewhat enjoyable romp though...its just not a very clean Star Wars title.
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,TotalGames.net,58,This is a fairly average title with no fresh direction and without a real challenge it won’t keep many Gameboy fanatics busy for long.
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Multiplayer.it,60,If youre a Kinect skeptic Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor will not change your mind. At all. Motion controls may work better or worse depending on the room but theyll never be accurate enough to let you survive an ambush.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,CGMagazine,50,The game is littered with fan service and was clearly made by people who love the property. In a way that’s what makes it so frustrating.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,GameZone,60,The new game is frustrating repetitive and not as memorable as the first.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Not an entirely awful virtual re-creation of the beautiful game. [Issue#61 p.95]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Informer,55,Like a Quidditch player falling from a broomstick mid-match this installment loses all forward momentum and goes plummeting toward a faceplant at top speed.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,VideoGamer,50,We expect something special from Far Cry and frankly Vengeance just isnt up to scratch. Like a Z-list celebrity leave this one in the jungle.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,FNintendo,40,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle has decent Arcade and Score Attack modes and the idea of playing the same plot with different characters is worthy of praise but the fights quickly become repetitive and dull its audiovisual component is a throwback to fifteen years ago and overall the game just feels uninspired.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,COGconnected,50,Whether it was the shoddy writing non-existent character development the floaty platforming physics or the combat mechanics that are often at odds with themselves Randall is the kind of game that is no more than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately that sum does not add up to a memorable experience.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GamerFeed,50,The latest entry in the once respectable ninja series is downright awful what with its lack of blood horrendous top down perspective and abominable story.
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,Armchair Empire,60,As a game its a little bit hard to recommend this especially considering that its basically just an assemblage of Flash-style games the kind you could play for free on a movie promo site.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,PC Zone UK,45,The bottom line is that these events while fairly dreary in reality simply have no place in a game. For all its production values and official licence ultimately youd have a more interactive experience playing with a yoyo while watching the Winter Olympics on the telly.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,Worth Playing,60,Ignoring all else in favor of the pool games themselves Pocket Pool is a fun pick-up-and-play pool title with more features and better controls than youd expect accessible to both pool fans and casual gamers alike.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,ZTGD,60,Speed Zone is not a terrible game as much as it is one that seems to try too hard to impress.
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GamePro,45,Coupled with the terrible combat the game is only 2 hours long.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,1UP,50,Its a surprisingly silent boring affair and youre probably better off just watching the ATHF clips with your pal or one of the four full episodes included on the disc (one of which has never been aired and is awesome).
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameZone,59,The control and camera bugs made it somewhat frustrating to keep trying to progress the enemy AI made it dull and too easy to battle the side quests were mostly silly and I didn’t want to do them.
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Nintendo Power,55,Just as the Legend of the Dragon TV series comes off as a faint echo of Dragon Ball Z The Game Factorys Wii adaptation serves as a reminder that it takes more than two battlers and an arena to make a memorable fighting game. [Aug 2007 p.84]
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GamePro,60,In the end though Quantum Theory bears the terrible imprimatur of the also-ran. While its a noble effort on Tecmo-Koeis part (this is after all their first foray into this genre) it just doesnt have that oomph that a killer action game hits you in the sensory cortex with.
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GameSpot,62,Fans of the genre can consider Land of the Babes a light snack between hearty meals.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Talk Xbox,55,If I was David Fincher right now I would be looking for the man or woman assigned to approve this project and making sure they never had a job again.
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Push Square,50,A depiction of hell that hasnt really been fully realised before Agony is marred by frustrating stealth sections and some poorly explained mechanics. The horrifying imagery is generally effective and the overall presentation manages to survive some glaring technical issues but this is very much an acquired taste in every sense of the word.
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,61,Despite showing enormous potential Crash Boom Bang! is hampered by dodgy controls and a testing user interface. Its disappointing because this could have been a great multiplayer game. [Christmas 2006 p.80]
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamerWeb Nintendo,65,As long as you don’t expect the fast pace and energy (not to mention multiplayer action) of it’s arcade and console counterparts you should have fun with this game.
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Gaming Age,58,Not that the game does anything bad it is as unoriginal as you can get in this land of competition.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,70,Enemy paths are obvious and at times theyll forget to shoot at you. Meanwhile youll die behind cover much too often requiring you to restart the whole level...If you can forgive these flaws Blackwater is old-school arcade fun and a solid step in making a hardcore Kinect game.
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,Nintendophiles,80,A landmark title with gameplay better than ever before and great play mechanics that defy portable gaming.
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,Vandal,60,Left Alive has many good ideas. Some of them are well-executed and many others are not. It’s a shame that many of these issues are on the gameplay side but if you really like the concept you can manage to enjoy it.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,TotalGames.net,55,A distinct lack of pace (something that made the original so absorbing) also makes the action far less exciting than it should be.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,The moose and the squirrel join a handful of friends to push buttons in the right order. [Issue#33 p.117]
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,GameStar,55,Despite all the freedom for the player Underworld Ascendant is a bug-spectacle that in spite of its great looks is more boring than thrilling.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,n-Revolution Magazine UK,50,Okay if you can get it cheap but there are far too many better party titles out there.
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,Da Gameboyz,60,With poor controls a mediocre graphics package sans the great characters and music that was bland all these make for a somewhat boring and average boxing experience.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,GameZone,69,Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing has a slew of faults that inevitably bring the title down but that’s not to say that you won’t have a good time in the ring.
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,PSX-Sense.nl,60,A fitting tribute to classic dungeon crawlers though low difficulty a lack of a level editor and a boring esthetic keep it from becoming a classic in and of itself.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,Game Over Online,56,A silly story that the developers don’t try to develop generally easy puzzles that are boring to solve a bad interface that tests your patience more than your intelligence and so-so graphics that don’t make the game fun to look at.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,52,This game has no excuse. Its very expensive for what it has to offer and if I were to polish my Flash and ActionScript knowledge I could have created it myself!
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Nintendo Gamer,48,We applaud the return to nature but outside of a few icky moments there really is nothing to recommend Necro-Nesia. Go throw a spider at someone; its a whole lot more fun. [JPN Import; Mar 2007 p.52]
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameSpot,45,Its got plenty of cute Tamagotchis but its short on depth and is seriously lacking in the fun department.
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Pocket Gamer UK,40,The release of Urban Champion as a 3D Classic makes us wonder if Nintendo has gone stark raving mad.
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,3DJuegos,45,Lucha Fury is a beat-em-up with a polished artistic direction colorful visuals and poor gameplay.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,Gaming Age,58,Consider it only if youve got a captive audience no internet connection and some time to kill with friends — and above all else dont expect too much.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,GameSpy,45,Horrid control combined with a poor interface leaves Combat Medic gasping for air on the battlefield.
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,COGconnected,65,Though there are some definite strengths throughout Past Cure like the textural environments the melodies and the overall world duality it simply fails to really take advantage of the hype gained from its badass trailers.
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,AtomicGamer,50,Dead Space: Ignition isnt a great game or even a good one.
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,GameSpot,45,No amount of Xzibit influence or ride pimpage can save Pimp My Ride from its god-awful minigames and lousy driving mechanics.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GamesRadar+,40,There are a ton of fine shooters hitting shelves this year that are good enough to go down in history. It would be a shame to waste your money paying full price for this heap which instead takes history down with it.
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Armchair Empire,45,Sniper: Art of Victory is a budget title and as such can be excused for some superficial failings. Unfortunately some of its failings are more than superficial take much of the fun out of the game.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Next Level Gaming,50,As for Torino 2006 I would look in the bargain bin for International Winter Sports 2002 instead.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Long-dead genre strikes back with cool screenplay and compelling story. Difficulty is pretty hard and controls deserve much improvement. [Issue#200]
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,PlayStation Universe,55,Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn is a fun title for as long as it lasts and a forgettable one once it ends.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Electronic Gaming Monthly,55,It feels like youre not fully in control. [Dec 2002 p.236]
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,GameWatcher,50,Kung Fu Rider is definitely not as funny as it thinks it is and not really much fun either.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,COGconnected,50,For my interest in something to be increased it has to be entertaining. This is where NBA Live 14 ultimately falls short for me.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,GameGrin,50,There were elements that I enjoyed about Coffin Dodgers and the fast-paced action and ragdoll physics led to some crazy races and funny fails. I enjoyed the story mode especially with its amusing ending. Plus the final showdown race is brilliant. But the game lacks depth and doesn’t really have that draw that made me want to keep playing especially with the omission of online features.
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Nintendo Gamer,47,With a few more months development this might have come good. But in this state not even Professor Xavier could convince us to play it again.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,GamesRadar+,50,The game follows a simple beat em up formula that will keep you entertained for awhile but it lacks so much of the depth and creativity that we expect from the comics and movies.
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,AceGamez,50,Damnation is an unfinished game a concept with good ideas and a real sense of scale but terrible implementation in almost every way.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,VGPub,57,I really wanted to like The Shield. Unless you’re a Shield enthusiast like me you’ll be safe passing on this one.
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Impulsegamer,45,While Orion: Dino Horde has potential it will certainly fall short of even modest expectations. If it werent for there already being quite the track record of bad Jurassic games Id suggest that fighting dinosaurs has never been so dull. A shame since its evident that the developers put a lot of time into it... its just too bad they didnt focus on making it fun.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Leave your superhero cape at home; Dream Chronicles instead begs for a mouse and keyboard--but this is a 360 game and theres no such pairing in sight. [Jan 2011 p.76]
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,PSX Extreme,41,Everything about playing Power Gig: Rise of the SixString is either disappointing or irksome in some way.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,GameSpot,60,A number of notable frustrations keep this moderately enjoyable flight-combat sim from soaring.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameZone,57,Add some simple moves a little combo and repeat...constantly. The special death move was also a failed attempt in my book.
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Nintendojo,47,The controls are buggy the graphics are choppy the sound is average and the voices will make you crawl up a wall in fear of your life.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,SpazioGames,45,A mere shadow of what a scrolling beatem up should be. The TMNT logo isnt enough to justify such a poor game who will particularly let down the ones who really loved the comics and the animated series dedicated to the four Ninja Turtles.
Hollow,Switch,Feb-22-2018,MMEU,Action Adventure | Survival,Nintenderos,68,A horror game with good ideas that comes up short in many aspects: while its history is addictive and progressively improves its short duration brings us back to reality and while its setting and sound put us in a tense mood with some jump scares mixed in its technical side takes us out of that mood with a significant range of defects to be cleaned up.
Legends of Pegasus,PC,Aug-10-2012,Kalypso | Novacore Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | 4X,GameStar,52,Please Calypso and Nova Core: Rescue what can be saved.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,Xbox 360,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Game Chronicles,52,The guitar is underutilized the music selection (despite a few gems) is merely average and the graphics are very last-gen.
Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Games Master UK,55,Not quite so bad its good but not so bad its awful either. Its worth a rent but just for laughs. [Aug 2009 p.82]
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,Brash Games,50,When the various elements come together which does happen in certain sections and when fate allows the game has the potential to be a clever informative and historically accurate stealth game set among one of the most intriguing and fascinating in recent history but too often this potential is over shadowed by clunky controls questionable AI and dated graphics that make the game look like it is a port from a previous console generation.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Hot Games,60,The same mediocre game on the Cube as it was on the PS2.
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameZone,48,Really disappointing [gameplay] poor controls poorly designed missions poor execution.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Game World Navigator Magazine,51,Every level is very small and no matter where you decide to hole up it will be easy for enemies to flank you. It’s not bad by itself but such design makes cover system – which was to become one of Umbrella Corps’ trump cards – redundant. So it comes as no surprise that combat quickly devolves into chasing after one another with one-hit-kill ax in hand. Of course it’s hard to talk about tactics or teamplay in this lumberjack’s paradise. [Issue#211 p.56]
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Push Square,40,While this won’t put off those who managed to overlook the shortcomings of the previous two games those looking to sign up for the first time on this voyage may want to seriously consider if the pirate life is for them.
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,Official Xbox Magazine,65,The individual layers of variation dont run terribly deep and offline exhibitions only cast a harsh light on amateurish A.I. flaws but Double D Dodgeballs offbeat mix of arcade action and online sporting teamwork still packs enough fast-paced intensity and simple strategy to be worth inviting to recess. [Sept 2008 p.77]
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,DarkStation,50,Arc of Alchemist had potential but ultimately fails to deliver a compelling experience. If you like chibi characters lots of dialogue grinding and mindless battle systems you might enjoy Arc of Alchemist. Otherwise this is a game you can easily skip.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Yahoo!,50,The worst-case scenario is that you pick a fight with the game store clerk who let you buy this title and get your face punched in. Then youll be stuck with both a black eye and a crummy game.
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PlayStation LifeStyle,50,Eternity: The Last Unicorn is not a great game. It’s a game that takes from Norse mythology but doesn’t really go deep enough to make you feel like you’re on a viking adventure. You can’t skip the cut scenes the camera is the hardest boss in the game and it just doesn’t live up to the games it emulates. I like you Eternity I just wanted better.
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,DualShockers,45,Tokyo Tattoo Girls is an extremely niche strategy RPG that doesnt build off of what is most interesting about the games systems and instead chooses to rely on cute anime girls for appeal which might work for some.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Everyeye.it,50,All in all fun and able to show the historical characters of the brand from a different point of view ONE PIECE: Grand Cruise would have won hands down our sympathy (and sufficiency) if it had been proposed not as a game but as a VR experience maybe free or otherwise at a price consistent with the very few contents offered by the package.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,ZTGD,49,The story is original but poorly told. The action is fast-paced but frustrating. Everything seems like a winner on paper but when you finally get your hands on the controller things just fall apart.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Electric Playground,70,The gameplay of Tsunami 2265 is best-suited for younger or for casual gamers.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,Video Game Talk,50,While the game seems to be somewhat technically proficient and the single player campaign is moderately extensive the repetitive nature of the gameplay and the mind-numbing tasks tend to drag on.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Next Level Gaming,50,Theres two cops Mike and Marcus. Wheres the two player simultaneous co-op mode?
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,TeamXbox,46,Boring and sub-par gameplay combined with bland visuals and sounds creates a gaming experience that should be missed. More time was needed fine tuning things such as game mechanics visuals and audio.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Next Level Gaming,47,With all of the gameplay and control issues the game simply isn’t any fun.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,48,It would be nice to play as each character in a Gauntlet-style format but the lack of distinctive abilities for each of the four characters puts the kibosh on that dream. One could surmise that this game was doomed from the start.
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,GamesRadar+,50,Even for hardcore Dead Space fans (which we are) skipping Ignition will mean missing nothing of import to the Dead Space canon.
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,Windows Central,50,With a user interface barely optimized for controllers and a release three years after its initial alpha it feels that consoles are a mere afterthought of the original vision.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,PSX Nation,50,If players approach Supercross World as an arcade racer that plays by the indoor and outdoor rules of motocross though then it has plenty to offer...Dead-average brain-dead motocross fun at its most basic level.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Nintendo Gamer,55,Its harmless but hardly worth bothering with. [May 2008 p.74]
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,N-Europe,60,Poor graphics and simple game-play detract from what could have been a great film-game conversion.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,GameSpot,50,While the modest selection of maps are sufficiently large and multileveled the uninspired deathmatch and conquest modes offer nothing that you cant find in other shooters.
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,ZTGD,45,Its sad really if under a different developer – it could have made for a viable opponent to the big boxing titles like but instead DSI games decided to make it a cheap gimmicky imitation of that which came before.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,40,Its obvious that some care and talent went into the making of this game. Unfortunately it just didnt dribble down to the most important part - the gameplay.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Worth Playing,55,Suffers from mediocrity. It is a solid game but there is nothing outstanding about it that would draw players to it or make the title worth acquiring. The game implements the two signature characters poorly which makes for annoying gameplay and there is no multiplayer portion whatsoever.
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,Worth Playing,55,Its difficult to not view the NCIS game as a blatant cash grab. It may be available at the lower price point of $40 ($30 for PC) but the four cases only take about four hours to complete and there is zero replay value.
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,IGN,50,Imagine if you will a weapon that not only blows a guy to smithereens and covers the screen with more blood than a MASH unit but also causes him to burst into flames and even projectile vomit all over himself for several painful seconds before he blows up. And if that isnt disgusting enough for you imagine grabbing one of his severed legs and whacking another dude over the head with it until he in turn spews even more blood and vomit and flames. Ew.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GameZone,55,The History Channel implementation level setup and graphic selections are A+ choices; it’s the execution that tanks the experience.
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Hardcore Gamer,40,The only way I could possibly recommend this game to anyone is if you have a blossoming interest in both breasts and fighting games and are trapped on some sort of desert island with a PS3 that only has Girl Fight on it. Everyone else is going to want to look elsewhere.
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,Da Gameboyz,51,I went into Valhalla Knights with high hopes including the optimism for a clean and smart online co-op multiplayer with a deep and engrossing storyline. Unfortunately I found a very broken and incomplete gaming experience.
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,Ragequit.gr,45,Super Seducer can only be seen as a relic of a thankfully bygone era and may only crack a smile with its cult vibe. The whole PUA idea has already been criticized and no-one is expected to take it seriously. Other than that its a sort of visual novel with linear progression that glorifies the quantification of flirting and the conditioning of people to Pavlovian techniques.
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,GameZone,55,This game is not very realistic and tries to combine arcade elements with a solid FPS backdrop and what happens is that this game looks contrived and stilted...This is a game to avoid.
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,DarkZero,50,Theres no denying it. Star Raiders is bad. Its repetitive embarrassing rushed and tedious.
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,ZTGD,61,King of Clubs feels like yet another me too title in a sea of the same.
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Digitally Downloaded,70,But again I found the soul of Langrisser to be well and truly in the right place and while I don’t believe it is a classic game I also don’t believe for a moment that it deserves the commentary it has been getting to date.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Games Master UK,40,Frustrating and joyless. [Apr 2009 p.74]
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Theres only one number that reflects this perfectly average experience.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,Edge Magazine,50,It’s a B-movie game in every sense but approach it with sufficiently lowered expectations and you may just be pleasantly surprised.
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,GameZone,65,This game is fun until you try to move. Rent the movie folks. It’s scarier and shorter.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,IGN,55,Its never anything special. Theres lots of action but its not exciting. Theres an upgrade system but its uninteresting. Theres a lot of content but its just the same stuff again and again.
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GameZone,40,This is by far one of the most disappointing and seemingly unfinished games that I have ever played in my entire life.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameWatcher,50,Its not a terrible game but it is a deeply average one.
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,PC Gamer UK,49,Rarely exciting mostly disappointing. An unfinished tactical shooter let down by technical issues and terrible AI.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Game Chronicles,50,While the game packs some potential the constant barrage of technical glitches renders it all but unplayable and leave it feeling like an unfinished work that was rushed to the shelves a month or two too soon.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,45,It’s boilerplate first-person shooter mechanics paired with dated visuals and cool ideas that never develop into cool experiences.
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Vandal,50,Quotation forthcoming.
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,IGN,40,This game is not fun. The game is too hard to be a childrens game and too boring to be a game to recommend to anyone; and thats when its working and not screwing the player over with bad controls.
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Vandal,45,Agony has good ideas but the developers have underrated the complexity of the survival horror genre and delivered a frustrating experience. Add its poor performance and bugs and you get a forgettable game.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Game Chronicles,58,I am a diehard Transformers fan ever since the original G1 series and I cant believe such a staple of the series is missing. With the lack of features average graphics acceptable sound and a completion time of less than 7 hours Id say Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition is a budget title at best but nothing an avid gamer or hardcore fan would take seriously especially with the 50$ price tag.
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,GameZone,50,Any fan of the genre has already been here and done this before — probably 2-3 years ago. While the visual and aural facets of YAE are generally solid its gameplay is not all that entertaining and there are plenty of other titles in the genre that can offer a more entertaining and diversified gaming experience.
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Worth Playing,50,A bad camera and bad controls however quickly shoot down this game with little to no hope of it getting better as you progress. For fans of the movie and the character it would be best to hunt down the GBA game to get their fix. If you dont have a system that can play that however your best bet would be to hold off on this and hope that someone will come along and do justice to this revered character.
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,TeamXbox,44,Had it been released as a slimmed-down Xbox Live Arcade title Bomberman Act: Zero would be a surefire hit right up there with Zuma in terms of addictive stage-based gameplay. But instead Bomberman Act: Zero is a $49.99 standalone title that you simply shouldn’t buy.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,NintendoWorldReport,40,As with most JPRGs a lot of progression options are present related to special powers and weapon upgrades. Since they don’t make the combat any easier to digest it doesn’t feel relevant to get too detailed about them. Not mentioning that you manually have to click through endless English dialogue while listening to Japanese voice acting doesn’t really change the fact that Fantasy Hero ~Unsigned Legacy~ is a title that can and should be ignored.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,G4 TV,40,If anything The Shield: The Game is true to the spirit of its source material. Much of the game may be poorly designed cruelly difficult and obnoxiously unfair but none of these flaws are necessarily show-stopping.
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,ZTGD,40,Girl Fight is a game that lives up to its name both in relevancy and simply being generic. Anyone thinking of jumping in knows what to expect but if you want scantily clad fighters there are much better options.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,Yahoo!,60,Dull depressing and monotonous. Although the combat system is reasonably interesting the game doesnt come close to making the most of it.
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,TeamXbox,51,The game is fun to play for a bit but the flaws of the gameplay and the repetition creep up faster than Capones top enforcer in a dark alley delivering the most lethal blow to the games bottom line.
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,Cheat Code Central,40,Are we going to be forever destined to inferior products based on popular characters wading through a series of hackneyed mini games?
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Meristation,50,After a complicated first launch Amy is reborn again to give some scares to this needed generation. Its a shame that all the good ideas the game has in its basics are not applied to the final version plagued with multiple bugs of AI control and visuals.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameSpot,40,Shallow and repetitive gameplay dull visuals and overused poor-quality film assets put this game in the failed-superhero category.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,GameZone,43,While it’s not the worst Superman game ever made it’s still not anything any sane person would want to play. If you need a Superman fix go rent the DVD instead.
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,Cynamite,60,Hulk’s orgy of destruction is entertaining at the beginning but unfortunately it’s the only motivating thing in the game. Both the missions and the story are weak.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Games Radar,61,With precious little true depth and a distinct lack of quality boxers to topple Tyson from his in-game mantle youll just not want to put in the hours at the gym. [PSM2]
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Only hipsters and farming fetishists need apply. [Nov 2013 p.91]
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,IGN,43,No matter what happens with stability and bug-fixing patches its poor controls awful interface and dull pacing ensure that X Rebirth will remain unpleasant for all but the most forgiving die-hard space jockeys.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,Push Square,50,Dawn of Fear is not what you would typically consider a good video game and it most definitely does not perform like one. However when it works there hasn’t been anything else quite like it for the best part of two decades. Dawn of Fear is the best and worst tribute to Resident Evil at the same time and we cant think anything more intriguing than that.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,Nintendo Power,48,Responsive play control and detailed graphics will make you want to venture deep into the story but difficult battles against incidental enemies may keep you from your goal. [Aug 2004 p.123]
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Nintendo Power,46,A compass points to your current objective but its still easy to get lost in the games complex levels. [Mar 2004 p.121]
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Computer Gaming World,50,Underneath its underwhelming exterior lurks an enjoyable well-balanced game that grows on you if you can just stomach the painful delivery. [May 2002 p.74]
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,Console Gameworld,45,Despite a cool concept the unusable controls and other flaws prevent Dragon Booster from making the cut.
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Vandal,49,It feels unfinished and rushed through development. We really think it couldve been polished to make it a better game but unless an important patch comes out its really hard to recommend taking into account all the constant crashes when playing online and the extremely short single player modes.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,PC Gamer,65,Mistmare has some truly wondrous landscapes and jaw-dropping monsters and such thanks in no small part to the LithTech engine but it just came out of the oven too early. [Nov 2003 p.118]
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,Pocket Games,45,Has the feel of a hasty port which is par for the course with Mortal Kombat games these days. But fun for a short while. [Summer 2003 p.30]
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,PSM Magazine,50,Sure its oddly satisfying to lumber around trading shots and crossing plasma swords with other stylized death machines but the slow stiff gameplay overshadows the cool stuff. [Jan. 2007 p.84]
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,MEGamers,57,Buy this game only if youre under 12 and a fan of the movie.
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,Cheat Code Central,48,With only ten levels and no multiple pathways the game is fairly short on content. You will most likely only play this game for three to five hours making the forty-dollar price tag seem way too steep to consider it for a purchase. Still the game can be a lot of fun.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Cynamite,40,Even fans of the comic won’t have fun with this piece. At the beginning the permanent explosions are quite entertaining but soon they get as boring as the monotony of a firing machine gun. No thanks!
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,48,The controls are so weak that I am having a tough time deciding which is more aggravating: controlling Bruce Lee or non-stop clipping. Either way youll be disgruntled by this games lack of an intuitive control system.
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,SpazioGames,45,The problems of Rekoil are many starting with the unbalanced weapon system to the extremely annoying and frequent visual bugs. The respawn system has been miscalculated. Bad sound animations and poor 3D models come together to provide a badly balanced game.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,DarkStation,50,As it is Zombeer stands as a decent zombie based FPS with a dash of hit or miss humor.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,Worth Playing,45,If you really want to play a volleyball video game stick with the older titles that focus on beach volleyball or pray that someone can come up with a better take on the indoor version of the sport.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,Siliconera,41,Since the game does provide some laughs and is fun when a friend is over $20 isnt too bad for the game.
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,GameCritics,40,Weeping Doll isn’t much of a game and at just an hour long with no hidden depth to necessitate a second playthrough it’s overpriced at ten dollars. That said as a first-generation console VR proof-of-concept it succeeds more than it fails.
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Gamer's Hell,52,The multiplayer can be fun but only because it means you wont have to endure the game alone.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,GameCritics,65,Apart from that absolutely baffling meat grinder at the end Id still recommend Escape to fans of the mid-list. 98% of it was an enjoyable spiral into insanity and the project could certainly stand on its own even without being attached to the Dead Island franchise -- just be ready to slog through that final bit to see how it all wraps up.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,Hardcore Gamer,50,It’s admirable that Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric tries so many new things but every path it follows is a dead end.
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,TheXboxHub,40,Gene Rain is a disappointment. It is ultimately good looking enough but shallow with poor gameplay and frankly laughable dialogue. The acting is poor the guns lack heft and the cover mechanic is broken so much that you really don’t want to get me started.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,COGconnected,37,The clunky controls combined with a ghost town of players to actually play this game online with really works against this title.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Cheat Code Central,44,A game that you should certainly pass by. It has few if any redeeming qualities and Im hard-pressed to imagine the sort of person who could actually have fun with this title.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,45,It’s a half-baked attempt at a game that can be fun in the occasional spooky part but ends up under-delivering in every way.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,55,If only the developers had spent more time polishing the single player mode to have a real story with in-game cutscenes and such. If only the single player had a mid-mission save system or at the very least if it didnt take so long to reload the level every time you died.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Gameblog.fr,40,Like the movie The Expendables 2 video game is shallow and focused on but one thing : brutal combats with millions of bullets flying. The only problem is that as it may be fun to watch in a 1 hour and a half movie its far from being fun to play for 3 and half hours even cooperatively especially with such low production values.
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,IGN,40,Why strain your eyes on a smaller version of the stack when you can just clear some space off the kitchen table and play the real thing?
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,XGN,50,This unique fighting game feels rushed in every single way. Fighters Uncaged responds very badly to your moves and thats simply something you cant afford when your life is at stake.
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,AceGamez,50,Mr Mirra may have been around for a long time but it seems that it is possible for an old rider to need to learn some new tricks because a lack of originality and options as well as some below par design overshadow the better qualities of Dave Mirra BMX Challenge.
Coliseum,PC,Jan-6-2004,Stormcloud Creations,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing,Frictionless Insight,50,Doesn’t feel interactive enough to be deeply involving. Much faster higher level seasons or far more options are needed to make the Coliseum exciting.
Kabuki Warriors,Xbox,Nov-19-2001,Light Weight,Action | Fighting | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine,59,A strangely bland fighting game. [Jan 2002]
Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,3DJuegos,52,Poor presentation poor playability AI-fueled opponent… If you are fan of pool games there are simply better options available.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,40,Give me a quality plot or an interesting setting or something to impress me enough to work through its weaker elements. Magus doesnt offer any stand out feature which makes it difficult to get too excited over.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Game Rant,50,Ghostbusters offers a top-down co-op shooter with light RPG elements that fails to capitalize on the magic and humor of the supernatural franchise.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GameZone,75,A must-have for any fan of the show. It is amusing and entertaining.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,CGMagazine,45,Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5 fails to recapture the magic of the first four games.
Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Console Gameworld,50,While every series needs its foundation Toy Shop feels like the blueprint of something better.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,Impulsegamer,55,Maybe if this budget title were offered for 5 dollars more gamers might be interested in putting on their asskicking shoes. For now though I cant offer much of a recommendation.
Grand Theft Auto IV,PC,Dec-2-2008,Rockstar Toronto,Action Adventure | Modern | Modern | Open-World,Meristation,100,Grand Theft Auto IV means the matureness for Rockstar abandoning -though not completely- all its insane humor and arcade action this chapter of Niko Bellic captures the essence of the american society with black humor great narrative and the characteristic 'sandbox' gameplay that the franchise has featured all this years. For the PC version all stays the same: only the great technical optimization the original video-editor and the 32 players online modes are present as news. But when you leave a masterpiece exactly the same its a right move.
Total War: Shogun 2,PC,Mar-15-2011,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | General | Historic,The A.V. Club,100,It's the ideal example of evolution trumping revolution in creating great video games.
Empire: Total War,PC,Mar-3-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,GameSpy,100,The simplified interface elements great campaign and much-improved map and information screens make this the most accessible Total War yet and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started.
Rayman Legends,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2013,Ubisoft Montpellier,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Games.cz,100,When someone brings an excellent title and then announces they are planning a sequel you automatically expect and sometimes you are right that the next installment won't beat the original. However Rayman Legends traverses this belief with its unshaken confidence and it sets forward the whole Rayman series to the new LEGENDARY level.
Astro Bot: Rescue Mission,PlayStation 4,Oct-2-2018,JapanStudio,Action Adventure | General,Impulsegamer,100,Astro Bot Rescue Mission is not only the best PSVR title to date but also arguably the best platformer of this generation so far.
Bayonetta + Bayonetta 2,Switch,Feb-16-2018,PlatinumGames,Miscellaneous | Compilation,New York Daily News,100,It all adds up to one of the must-have games on the Switch alongside Super Mario Odyssey The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Skyrim. Still need a reason to buy a Switch? You’re all out of them.
Kentucky Route Zero - Act IV,PC,Jul-20-2016,Cardboard Computer,Adventure | General,Destructoid,100,Kentucky Route Zero Act IV is fu*king fantastic.
Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition,Wii U,Jul-2-2014,DrinkBox Studios,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendojo,100,The game makes extensive use of a mechanic reminiscent of the best 2D Zelda titles and familiar sounding riffs feature in the music from time to time. It’s pleasing and a significant achievement then that none of this is at the expense of Guacamelee’s own identity.
NBA 2K12,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2011,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Giant Bomb,100,"Were it not for the online issues NBA 2K12 would be the closest thing to a ""perfect"" video game basketball experience we have yet come to. In fact it still probably is. This is one of those rare sports games where the offline content nearly made me forget about the online component."
ESPN NHL Hockey,PlayStation 2,Sep-9-2003,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,Play Magazine,100,The true star of the ESPN NHL Hockey is the play-by-play commentary.

Command & Conquer: Red Alert,PC,Oct-31-1996,Westwood Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Command,GameSpot,95,"Red Alert belongs in the same category as ""Civilization II"" and ""Quake"" games that followed legendary predecessors and immediately eclipsed them. One can only wonder where Westwood can take us from here."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone,PC,Oct-13-2015,CD Projekt Red Studio,Role-Playing | Action RPG,LEVEL (Czech Republic),100,Great expansion whose central motif is one sophisticated storyline. The only minus is worse a weaker side quest line and absence of references to the original game and its main storyline. [Issue#258]
Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,PC,Mar-26-2002,Raven Software,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Shooter | Linear | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Computer Gaming World,100,It's just beautifully designed: fast-paced challenging and awesome to look at. [June 2002 p.78]
Wipeout HD Fury,PlayStation 3,Jul-23-2009,Studio Liverpool,Driving | Racing | Futuristic | Futuristic | Arcade,Play UK,100,Fury feels like a standalone game as opposed to a piece of DLC. [Issue#183 p.82]
Halo 2 Multiplayer Map Pack,Xbox,Jul-5-2005,Bungie Software,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Games Radar,100,Bungie really has outdone itself and better than that it's positively ushered in a glorious new era for the greatest multiplayer shooter on the planet. [Xbox World UK]
Resident Evil 2,PC,Jan-25-2019,Capcom R&D Division 1,Action Adventure | Survival,LEVEL (Czech Republic),100,The remake of Resident Evil 2 succeeded and can’t be criticized for much.

Borderlands 2,Xbox 360,Sep-18-2012,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Quarter to Three,100,I'm not terribly surprised that the studio that made the first Borderlands has created such a wildly good gunplay-based action RPG. But I'm surprised that the studio that stitched together Duke Nukem Forever and all those Brothers in Arms games has also made it such a joy to discover for reasons other than the awesome guns and gunplay. Bravo Gearbox.
Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable,PSP,Jul-5-2010,Atlus,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GamePro,100,Despite being familiar with the game Persona 3 Portable still managed to utterly consume me. When a game has such a profound effect on me I believe it deserves nothing less than the highest praise I can lavish upon it.
XCOM: Enemy Unknown,PlayStation 3,Oct-9-2012,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Tactics,Giant Bomb,100,Extreme fastidiousness notwithstanding it can take around 30 hours to see through the single-player campaign in XCOM: Enemy Unknown though like Firaxis' Civilization series there are so many different ways to prioritize the research engineering economic and tactical elements of the game that it almost begs for multiple playthroughs.
Call of Duty 2,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2005,Infinity Ward,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GamePro,100,A freakin' work of art. It is without a doubt the best-looking console game to date and the most psychotically intense World War II shooter to boot.

How this game didn't top more lists than it did as possible GOTY material in 2011 is beyond me because it certainly deserves all the accolades it's received thus far (and more!).

What Remains of Edith Finch,Switch,Jul-4-2019,Giant Sparrow,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Nintendo Enthusiast,100,I can’t recommend What Remains of Edith Finch enough if anyone has yet to play it. With so many incredible games that are currently coming to Switch it’s important to support the special titles coming from publisher Annapurna Interactive. Its explorations of loss and tragedy left me emotional on numerous occasions yet it also holds an uplifting and edifying emotional core. This experience remains undiminished thanks to a comprehensive port that doesn’t make any drastic sacrifices to the performance and visuals.

NHL 11,Xbox 360,Sep-7-2010,Electronic Arts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,Gaming Nexus,100,In the end this is a game that's hard not to recommend especially in light of the fact that 2K Sports didn't offer a competitor on the 360 or PS3 this year so EA could have just stuck with last years game. Instead they upped their offering to the point that taking this year off could be absolutely the worst thing that 2K could have done.

Black Ops still has some technical flaws (some erratic scripts) but it doesn't lack ambition variety nor freshness. Its solo campaign boasts a good scenario and its multiplayer is as comprehensive and solid as ever while changing some basic systems for the better and introducing soon-to-be-cult new modes as well as community features one could only find in the latest Halo iterations before. There may be ways to improve it yet again but the 2010 CoD delivers on its promise - we can't say anymore that Treyarch's Call of Dutys don't measure up.

And refreshingly the online modes appeal to not just those who have immersed themselves in online battles for years but newcomers and even just the mildly interested as well.

F-Zero X,Nintendo 64,Sep-30-1998,Nintendo,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,Gaming Age,96,The framerate and action more than makes up for the slightly less than average graphics.

Robo Recall,PC,Mar-1-2017,Epic Games,Action | General | Shooter | Light Gun,Guardian,100,Robo Recall is an almost perfect VR arcade experience. The only downside is that the cost of entry for Oculus Rift and Touch – even with a new lower price of £598 – is still too high for many when you include the cost of the PC needed to run it. But that’s not the game’s fault.

It's a rough emotional ride that will make you want to replay the episode to see what exactly would happen if you changed your choices. It really is the best episode in the series so far. It will be very difficult to top this one. The cliffhanger to this episode will guarantee that you will want to play the next. I highly suggest the entire series and especially this episode without any doubts.
AudioSurf,PC,Feb-15-2008,BestGameEver.com,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,1UP,95,I can see anyone coming back to this again and again over the next few years and that's more than enough to justify the peanuts they're asking for Audiosurf.

It's a treat having an enhanced (both gameplay-wise and visually) version of the game that you can toss in your pocket and play on the go. This is easily the best launch title in the DS lineup.
Dead Rising,Xbox 360,Aug-8-2006,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Open-World,Yahoo!,100,The spaced out save points create a wonderfully rare sense of dread. You'll want to stock up on inventory and weapons before attempting a particularly difficult passage. And you're not always secure whether you're going to make it. This is where Dead Rising's sandbox zombie killing comes into its own.
MLB The Show 17,PlayStation 4,Mar-28-2017,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Sports | Team | Baseball | Sim,Gaming Age,100,Of course if I'm being honest offline single-player is what I care about most when it comes to MLB The Show anyway so it's not like multiplayer was going to change my opinion too much one way or the other. And from that perspective — that is as someone who's probably going to spend a few hundred hours with the game over the next year with 95% of that being in RTTS — I have to say that MLB The Show 17 once again delivers.

But rather than risking a break-down Nintendo was smart enough to dismantle its Mario Kart core formula in order to correctly refreshen each and every one of its clogs before putting them back together. As an added bonus the mechanic repainted it nicely and added some of the latest technologies. The end result roars at soon as the engine starts and promises to run nicely for quite some time thanks to solid online features.
Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones,Xbox,Dec-1-2005,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,96,All of the game's elements mesh from the music to the storyline from the puzzles to the control system.

Assault Android Cactus,PlayStation 4,Mar-8-2016,Witch Beam,General | Scrolling | Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gaming Age,100,The one downside to a gorgeous fast-paced whirlwind of constant activity is that there's not much of a story to go along with it.

Darksiders II,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vigil Games,Modern | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Fantasy | Open-World,Gaming Age,100,The voice acting is all wonderfully done especially Death. He's such a great character and is very funny throughout the game especially in the way he deals with some of the side-quests that characters give him. If you already own the game there's very little incentive to picking up the Wii U version but if you've held off or never had the means to buy it until now I highly recommend the purchase.
Guitar Hero: Metallica,Wii,Mar-29-2009,Neversoft Entertainment,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Gaming Age,100,For fans of the Guitar Hero franchise Guitar Hero: Metallica might be the best entry we've seen yet. I was somewhat lukewarm on my reception to the other band-themed title that Neversoft put out with GH: Aerosmith but Metallica absolutely blows that game out of the water not only with the track listing but the overall time and attention put into the actual presentation and how the band seems to be infused into every aspect of the game.

Full Metal Furies,PC,Jan-17-2018,Cellar Door Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpace,87,Full Metal Furies is high-quality side-scrolling brawler that understands its roots while still managing to both pushes the genre forward with its inclusion of some great RPG elements as well as add its own unique style to the genre. Furies offers many hours of single-player fun and shines exceptionally well when played to its full potential as a co-op experience. I highly recommend picking this title up if you’re looking for something new and charming.

Madden NFL 08,Xbox 360,Aug-14-2007,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Sim | Sim,Yahoo!,100,These animations are gorgeous to look at from Reggie Bush doing his trademark summersault for six or a Chad Johnson river dance after a score. This is because the game runs at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second...Madden 08 is simply superb. If you could only own one next-gen football this is it.

It’s mitigated to a point by having you lose all your money before entering a castle and each purchased bonus makes all the others more expensive.
BattleBlock Theater,Xbox 360,Apr-3-2013,The Behemoth,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,GamingTrend,92,At 1200 MS points it’s a small price to pay for the madness and certainly lives up to its Castle Crashers pedigree for polish poise and preposterous premise.
Dragon Quest Builders 2,Switch,Jul-12-2019,Square Enix,Role-Playing | General | Action Adventure | Sandbox,VGC,100,Dragon Quest Builders 2 is the perfect sequel. The kind that improves on every aspect of the original adding more meaningful content to the mix quality of life fixes and throwing some interesting new aspects at players whilst maintaining that core that made the first game so enjoyable in the first place.
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow,PlayStation 3,Oct-5-2010,Mercury Steam,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gaming Age,100,It's a great game separate from the franchise and definitely does a favor for the third person action genre but with the CV characters and license attached it becomes even more enjoyable for me.
Pokemon Diamond Version,DS,Apr-22-2007,Game Freak,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Trainer,Thunderbolt,100,Easily one of the greatest titles on the DS...Between exploring the massive towns wandering through the multi-tiered wastelands and challenging legions of trainers you’ll enjoy a lengthy adventure that no other DS game can boast.

Yakuza Kiwami 2,PlayStation 4,Aug-28-2018,Sega | Ryu ga Gotoku Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gaming Age,100,I really really enjoyed my time with Yakuza Kiwami 2 and as a fan of the series I’d certainly urge you to check it out. It has very few flaws outside of some minor animation issues and the occasional cumbersome combat sequence. It also feels like a much stronger remake than even Yakuza Kiwami which was no slouch to begin with. It also has some solid ties to both Yakuza 0 via the new elements and pre-existing story beats that feed into the more recent Yakuza 6. So check this one out when you get a chance you will not be disappointed.
Thief: Deadly Shadows,PC,May-25-2004,Ion Storm,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Four Fat Chicks,100,I have never seen a game use light the way Deadly Shadows does nor have I seen such realistic environments rendered on the fly.

The game has a simple concept executed very well with precise controls and finely balanced difficulty but it is the magical ambience and an urge towards self-mastery that keep drawing me back hurtling downhill with my heart in my mouth.

Sid Meier's Civilization V: Brave New World,PC,Jul-8-2013,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | Historic | 4X,DarkStation,100,Really the best part about Brave New World is that it’s finally addressed every victory condition in the game and made each one not only more equally viable but also just as busy. Weaponizing culture works to bring it more in line with the other conditions–it’s something you have to work towards and not something you just happen to achieve. On top of that the diplomacy changes make this system more interesting as well and it all comes down to one thing: if you have Civilization V and want to play more you owe it to yourself to get this expansion.

Saints Row: The Third,PC,Nov-14-2011,Volition Inc.,Action Adventure | Modern | Modern | Open-World,ZTGD,93,Saints Row The Third surprised the heck out of me. The GTA comparisons are inevitable but they are vastly different games. While both hold a mirror up to reality the reflections are vastly different. As absurd as GTA gets it still keeps one foot firmly planted in reality. Saints Row has taken a flying leap off the roof of reality howling the F-bomb while chugging a licensed energy drink all the way down… and I wouldn't have it any other way.
Bomberman Live,Xbox 360,Jul-18-2007,Backbone Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,AceGamez,100,It looks great it sounds good and it plays like a real dream the simplistic gameplay revealing hidden depths and strategies the more you play with plenty of hilarious moments of death or glory in every game you can play.

Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom,PlayStation 4,Mar-23-2018,Level 5,Action RPG | Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Guardian,100,Its gorgeously lush visuals are quite simply among the best ever seen in a game offering an object lesson in how stylisation has the power to trump photorealism even in the 4K age. Some players will lack the time or patience to put in the effort that any heavyweight role-playing game demands – this is a 50-hour adventure at least – but it puts forward an irresistible case for your attention. As video games are once again weathering ignorance-fuelled attacks that paint them as universally gun-centric violent and nihilistic Ni no Kuni is a timely counterpoint.
Project CARS 2,Xbox One,Sep-22-2017,Bandai Namco Games | Slightly Mad Studios,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,IGN,92,Project CARS 2 plays like a pumped-up version of the classic TOCA Race Driver 3 from 2006 redressing many of the complaints levelled at the original.
Statik,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2017,Tarsier Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,VRFocus,100,Statik is a superb example of a puzzle game intelligent immersive and lots of fun to play. The subtle story woven through is interesting the puzzles challenging without being too frustrating. VR is used superbly as an integral part of the experience and not a tacked on gimmick. Definitely worth picking up for anyone who owns a PlayStation VR.
Fallout: New Vegas,PC,Oct-19-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,RealGamer,95,Fallout: New Vegas looks and plays exactly the same as Fallout 3.

Valkyria Chronicles Remastered,PlayStation 4,May-17-2016,Sega,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Digitally Downloaded,100,Valkyria Chronicles is simply one of the best tactical games you’ll ever play. It’s serious but doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s emotionally compelling while never losing sight of the fact it’s also a game. It’s a popular and well-regarded game that for whatever reason people simply don’t talk about it enough. Hopefully with this PlayStation 4 release that will change.

Crysis 2,Xbox 360,Mar-22-2011,Crytek,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Xbox World Australia,95,I absolutely loved Crysis 2 from start to finish. The game looks amazing sounds amazing and plays like a dream. The singleplayer campaign was a satisfying 10 hours and left me wanting to play it again at a higher difficulty setting. Multiplayer borrows a few ideas from other games but overall is a unique and highly enjoyable experience even if it does force you to put in the time to get the most out of it.
Virtua Tennis: World Tour,PSP,Oct-7-2005,Sumo Digital,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,VideoGamesLife,100,"Fast fluid and thoroughly absorbing Virtua Tennis World Tour is not only as essential a purchase as ""Lumines"" ""WipEout"" ""Ridge Racers"" and Co. it’s a reason to buy the PSP itself."

RPG fans of all kinds are sure to fall for this love letter to the genre. Meaningful side-quests an engaging combat system and a story that makes something amazing out of what could easily be a simple routine: these elements represent only a fraction of Cold Steel 3's achievements. The performance isn't flawless but portability and lengthy RPGs go hand-in-hand making this a must-own title on Switch.

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,PlayStation 4,Sep-30-2014,Monolith Productions,Fantasy | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Open-World,Guardian,100,Right now it’s my main contender for game of the year simply because in its lack of pretension its attention to detail and its understanding that video games first and foremost should be fun it puts everything else I’ve played recently in its long shadow.
SpaceChem,PC,Mar-2-2011,Zachtronics Industries,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Everyeye.it,90,Due to its extreme complexity SpaceChem will never be a title for everyone. Too deep and articulate for casual players it will be appreciated only by those who are willing to engage themselves with the deep game mechanics Nevertheless Spece chem is no doubt one of the most brilliant puzzle game in the history of videogames.
Viva Pinata,Xbox 360,Nov-9-2006,Rare Ltd.,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,XboxAddict,96,The most surprising part about Viva Piñata is that once you've gained higher levels of experience you keep them. Even if you start a new garden. Which means you carry over all you coins and all the items you've unlocked during the course of your previous gardens so you don't have to start that all over again. Killer!

Pokemon Ultra Sun,3DS,Nov-17-2017,Game Freak,Role-Playing | Trainer,Vooks,100,Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon represent everything Game Freak has worked towards in its 20 years of growing the Pokémon franchise.

South Park: The Fractured But Whole,Xbox One,Oct-17-2017,Ubisoft San Francisco,Role-Playing | General,TrueAchievements,100,Housing a story that is both offensive yet hilarious ludicrous yet serious is a rare achievement but this game accomplishes it.

I knew within the first few minutes that it was going to be something truly special earning a place in my favourite games of all time.

TimeSplitters: Future Perfect,PlayStation 2,Mar-21-2005,Free Radical Design,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,100,So say what you will about TimeSplitters being too arcadey or too cartoony or not serious enough—I'll just be over here having a hell of a time. Last I checked that's what games were for.

Valkyria Chronicles,Switch,Oct-16-2018,Sega,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Gaming Age,91,In terms of a great bargain it’s hard to get better than a game like Valkyria Chronicles and the quality of this port on the Switch means it’s a must-buy for anyone curious about the series or considering adding it to their Switch library. And the only thing that makes an SRPG better is the portability of having it around to make dull moments like bus rides and family events breeze on by.
Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment,Switch,Mar-3-2017,Yacht Club Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Digital Chumps,90,Ultimately there is very little bad to say about SoT. It’s an excellent 2D action platformer with some good RPG elements and its balanced difficulty lets genre hacks like me struggle through while more seasoned players can still expect a good but not overly difficult challenge. To be honest some of the early bosses proved harrowing for me but I liked that I could try going after the different knights out of order find checkpoints and have a lot of opportunities to continue at those checkpoints too. Much like the old games its inspired by it’s a tough but short and arguably more memorable than many of those older games. Additionally with New Game+ support for more nooks and crannies to explore as well as Feats and Challenges there’s a solid value here for $10. The only better value would be to get SoT via the Treasure Trove release instead.
Street Fighter X Tekken,PlayStation 3,Mar-6-2012,Capcom,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 2D | 3D,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,91,Street Fighter X Tekken is much more than just a fun party game. Even better based on the number of unique mechanics we would say this is Capcom's best fighter in a long time. Whereas Street Fighter IV and MvC 3 only had one unique feature SFXT has dozens.

Beyond Good & Evil HD,Xbox 360,Mar-2-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameOver.gr,100,It is not about the known camera issues that cause several headaches or the short story. It is not about what this game should be and what has become of it. Itʼs about the very essence of gaming the essence that draws a permanent smile on your face while playing this masterpiece!
Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition,PlayStation 2,Apr-11-2005,Rockstar San Diego,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,AceGamez,100,A perfect blend of arcade style action mixing the best of Midnight Club 2 Midtown Madness Need for Speed Underground and Burnout 3.

High Heat Major League Baseball 2003,PlayStation 2,Feb-9-2002,3DO,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Sim,GamePro,100,Half of High Heat 2003's thrills come from its intuitive playable controls. Fielding and baserunning are a snap (though manual slides would have rocked) and the pitching/batting setup is one of the best ever.
Super Street Fighter II: Turbo Revival,Game Boy Advance,Oct-30-2001,Capcom,Action | Fighting | 2D,Hot Games,100,The graphics in this miniature version do the game perfect justice.
FIFA 17,Xbox One,Sep-27-2016,EA Sports | EA Vancouver,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,GameOver.gr,95,Simply put this is the best FIFA game we’ve seen in years and a superb package that will keep you hooked for months.

The cars are absolutely stunning and the way they handle makes each of them feel unique. Driving has rarely felt so good. [Nov 2005]
F1 2010,PlayStation 3,Sep-22-2010,Codemasters Birmingham,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Formula One | Formula One | Automobile,Gameblog.fr,100,Even though there are some mistakes here and there (let's say it's youth related) F1 2010 probably remains one of the best F1 racing games ever. It's reminiscent of the old Formula One on the original PlayStation and even better of the legendary F1 '97. But a thousand times more comprehensive and realistic. Its career mode grants it an enormous playtime expectancy and racing over the internet or against the clock is a delight best served with long evenings to fully enjoy it. Well that's it : F1 2010... what else ?
Maximo: Ghosts to Glory,PlayStation 2,Feb-11-2002,Capcom,Action | Platformer | 3D,Four Fat Chicks,100,Ghosts to Glory is one of the most addicting angering exciting and unforgiving-as-all-get-out (when jumping onto moving targets) games that I have ever played! There is never a dull moment.
BlazBlue: Central Fiction,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,90,BlazBlue really is gorgeous. Every character is animated in such a way that every movement they make reinforces their personalities. Every environment is a living breathing thing that sets a meaningful scene and helps build the world around the characters. Because everything is 2D and quite flat it’s easy to wish that all that storytelling and character building was funnelled into a more natural fit but then again with BlazBlue being such a successful franchise for so long now it’s hard to argue that the developers and producers are making a mistake.
Prey,Xbox One,May-5-2017,Arkane Studios,General | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Windows Central,100,Prey might not be the prettiest game but it's among the most atmospheric. Arkane Studios has proven itself time and time again to be comprised of world-class world builders. Prey is no different.

Sound Shapes,PlayStation Vita,Aug-7-2012,SCEA,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Gaming Age,100,Overall I found Sound Shapes to be an absolute joy to play with little to no complaints about the actual game itself. Outside of some clunky feeling mechanics on the level editing side via the Vita touch screen this marks my favorite platforming experience since Rayman Origins.
Gears 5,Xbox One,Sep-6-2019,The Coalition,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,TheXboxHub,100,I have no hesitation in naming Gears 5 on Xbox One as a triumph. The story is amazing the multiplayer works perfectly and Horde and Escape are the cherries on the cake.

Gnomes,PC,Dec-8-2014,Blizzard Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Strategy | Turn-Based | Card Battle,LevelUp,95,With its brilliant well-thought-out design Hearthstone is destined to become one of the best card games ever created.

Resident Evil 5,PlayStation 3,Mar-13-2009,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),100,Perhaps Resident Evil 5's most remarkable achievement is how it deftly straddles the line between the franchise's sometimes endearing sometimes frustrating legacy gameplay mechanics while incorporating more contemporary action adventure elements like enhanced interaction and exploration of environments and a decidedly more shooter-like control scheme. [Mar 2009 p.38]
God of War: Origins Collection,PlayStation 3,Sep-13-2011,Ready at Dawn,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Gaming Age,100,With enhanced anti-aliased visuals running at 60 fps and 1080p both games on the PlayStation 3 look about as fantastic as you would expect them to when making the transition from a 480x272 pixel portable screen.
Salt and Sanctuary,PlayStation 4,Mar-15-2016,Ska Studios,Action | Platformer | 2D,LEVEL (Czech Republic),100,"This tribute to Souls series is built on the proven mechanics but it extends them beyond the ""original"" universe.

Xenogears,PlayStation,Oct-20-1998,SquareSoft,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Games Domain,100,"Combining good action dark drama a splash of anime and lots of Really Big Robots this game is the must-buy Playstation RPG of the season... Square's greatest masterpiece since it started producing for Playstation and I highly recommend this game to anyone who's even heard of ""Final Fantasy."""

Tetris DS,DS,Mar-20-2006,Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking | Stacking,GamePro,100,Aside from an unresponsive touchscreen issue every now and then Tetris DS is an amazing puzzle package and is easily one of the best DS games to date - a perfect partner for the upcoming DS Lite.
Dark Souls Remastered,PlayStation 4,May-25-2018,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Guardian,100,If you want to visit Lordran and enjoy a straight-up bash-the-baddies quest then you’ll find no better collection of bosses than this. If a new kind of adventure appeals however one in which quick fingers matter less than brains and human cunning there’s still nothing like Dark Souls. After seven years its mystery has diminished but it’s still among the best of the best.
Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor,DS,Jun-23-2009,Atlus,Role-Playing | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,Worth Playing,93,Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor is easily one of the best strategy-RPGs on the Nintendo DS and may even be one of the better strategy RPGs ever made.
Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones,GameCube,Dec-1-2005,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,96,All of the game's elements mesh from the music to the storyline from the puzzles to the control system. I can't find anything nasty to say about this game. Ubisoft have certainly done their homework.
Tales From The Borderlands: Episode 1 - Zer0 Sum,PC,Nov-25-2014,Telltale Games,Miscellaneous | General | Adventure | General,DarkStation,100,Telltale puts it’s own spin on things but fans will appreciate their faithfulness to the source material.

Accessible and fun it remains realistic as well with a huge career mode and ranks up as the top title of the franchise to date.
Sprint Vector,PC,Feb-2-2018,Survios,Racing | Arcade | Other,VRFocus,100,There’s very little to dislike in Sprint Vector. Sure there will be times when that competitive edge over takes you getting annoyed when you fudge a jump but that’s to be expected. The single-player has enough to get you started with a few hours of gameplay yet it’s the multiplayer that’ll have you coming back for more.

Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares,PC,Oct-1-1996,SimTex,Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | 4X,TotalGames.net,92,It's a high quality product that blends tactics strategy and management into an accessible and playable game -- just watch out for the appearance of any latent megalomaniac tendencies.
Control,Xbox One,Aug-27-2019,Remedy Entertainment | 505 Games,Action Adventure | General,DarkStation,100,Control marks a new and glorious beginning for Remedy and hopefully there are more wonderful things to come. Despite a few pacing issues here and there and some exhausting late-game shoot-outs I gladly award the game a perfect score. Am I biased doing so as a Finn myself? Maybe but Control is a game that today's dull unimaginative and opportunistic gaming climate doesn't deserve but I’m happy it exists.

Resident Evil 3,Xbox One,Apr-3-2020,Capcom | M-Two,Action Adventure | Survival,DarkStation,100,All in all Resident Evil 3 goes on to prove that the traditional Resident Evil formula only souped-up to meet today’s needs works better than excuse me for saying this out loud the first-person flatness that was introduced in Resident Evil 7 or brainless shooting action of super-overvalued Resident Evil 4 that took the illustrious series entirely in the wrong direction only to be redeemed by these excellent remakes.
GRIS,PC,Dec-13-2018,Nomada Studio,Action | Platformer | 2D,PlayGround.ru,100,A true indie gem.

FIFA 18,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,EA Vancouver,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Gaming Age,100,My opinion on sports games comes down entirely to two factors: how good is the career mode and how well does it represent the sport. And on both those counts FIFA 18 delivers in spades.

Assassin's Creed Origins,PC,Oct-27-2017,Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gaming Age,100,Assassin’s Creed Origins manages to live up to the expectation that the preview event gave me. I dubbed it “near perfect” after that event and the final product does not disappoint. A few pacing issues late in the story caused things to drag a little bit and the loot system doesn’t remain intriguing after the first few hours but finding a complaint beyond that is difficult. You can nitpick some of the graphical hiccups or complain about repetitive side quests but even those manage to stay fun and interesting with all of the different styles of play. On a day with two other heavy hitting AAA games and an amazing TV show releasing simultaneously your time and money are going to be precious commodities. With Game of the Year talks coming up Assassin’s Creed Origins is a serious contender for the title in my book.
Shatter (2009),PC,Mar-15-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,92,Shatter is a brilliant expansion to traditional arcade-style gameplay and how often can you say that a new contender has improved on a classic?

The length difficulty and corny story will turn a lot of people off but the incredible gameplay and thrill of climbing the leaderboards is more than enough to keep this gamer engaged.

If you've already played it it's still as awesome as ever - with the added bonus of Race Mode.

Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch,Switch,Sep-20-2019,Level 5 | Engine Software,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Gaming Age,100,It’s rare to find a game that’s as visually appealing as this one and if that means going through a bit (okay a lot) of grinding to see all this game has to offer it may just be a price worth paying.

It's an intelligent nuanced design with fathoms of depth which marks a return to the importance of player creativity in shooters and simultaneously evolves the concept of interactivity in an FPS world. And with two cleverly complimentary secondary modes it will have serious legs for a good long while to come.
Prince of Persia: Warrior Within,PlayStation 2,Nov-30-2004,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Fantasy,G4 TV,100,Once again it exemplifies the very definition of a boundary-pushing video game.

SUPERHOT VR,PC,Dec-5-2016,SUPERHOT,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Road to VR,91,Superhot VR is built upon a one-of-a-kind bullet-time mechanic that translates phenomenally well to VR. After a slow start you'll find that the game is part action and part puzzle as you dodge incoming firing in slow motion while finding the most effective way to shatter your enemies. The core gameplay is challenging and enjoyable though it comes up just short of hitting a masterful climax of game mechanics. The story elements are mostly distractions and like many of the best VR experiences we're left wishing there was more than the 2 or so hours of gameplay available. [Tested with Oculus Touch]

Call of Duty: Black Ops 4,PlayStation 4,Oct-12-2018,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Telegraph,100,It is mechanics that glue Black Ops 4 together then rather than any particular theme which helps each component drill down into what its good at.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,PC,Jun-18-2019,ArtPlay,Action | Role-Playing | Platformer | Action RPG | 2D,Twinfinite,100,Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is as close to perfect as fans of metroidvania games could hope for.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has enough to keep gamers hooked for nights on end and it’s only going to get bigger as time goes on.
Hakuoki: Kyoto Winds,PlayStation Vita,May-16-2017,Idea Factory | Otomate,Adventure | Visual Novel,Gaming Age,100,the story is actually interesting. In general terms of course the game is focused on the main character Chizuru romancing the various Shinsengumi samurai but there's a clear plot beyond that: she's traveled to Kyoto to find her missing father. After she stumbles into a bad situation almost immediately upon her arrival (in which the Shinsengumi play a prominent role) everything that happens in the game is set in motion. It's appropriately mysterious which makes this game much closer to an actual novel than most of its other genre brethren.

Life is Strange 2: Episode 5 - Wolves,PC,Dec-3-2019,DONTNOD Entertainment,Action Adventure | General,TheGamer,100,"If you've played the first Life Is Strange or its prequel then you'll already be aware that developers Don't Nod are fans of making onion chopping ninjas appear while you're gaming. You'll happily be making (what you thought were) smart choices when suddenly that smart choice doesn't look so hot anymore. I knew going in that this was going to be a rough journey. What I didn't know was how incredibly sensitively handled and well-told this traumatizing tale would be. Life Is Strange 2 tackles a number of issues with racism being the most prominent and Episode Five continues in the same vein as the earlier ones. It skillfully weaves choices that really matter into a heartbreaking but incredibly moving finale for two brothers who have finally come to the end of the road. Continue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view. Start now The Story So Far While this review won't include spoilers for Episode Five it's assumed that you've played the first four chapters. If you haven't why are you reading this review instead of catching up? After the traumatic aftermath of their father's death Sean and Daniel went on the run. Right from the start the choices you made mattered and Episode Five really shows this. You can even choose if you saved Arcadia Bay in the first game which is reflected in the later narrative of Episode 5 especially in this final part. RELATED: Arise: A Simple Story Review: Here Come The Waterworks After numerous nasty incidents mostly involving racists taking against the boys for being Mexican and a close call with the police we left the boys in the aftermath of a dramatic escape. After Daniel was brainwashed by a cult while Sean was in the hospital Sean and the boys' mother Karen mounted a rescue. As Episode Four concluded the brothers finally looked at peace as they drove off with Karen. The Wolf Brothers The episode begins with some bonding between the brothers. Enjoy this peace as things are about to get very rough. Predictably the calm doesn't last and the brothers are on the road once more still hoping to reach the Mexican border and finally Puerto Lobos. In some ways this episode is less traumatic than others. Episode Four was a rollercoaster from start to finish but this finale slows the pace at least in the beginning. It's a welcome relief and gives players a chance to catch their breath a little as they meet some interesting characters including someone who will be very familiar to fans of the first game. RELATED: Choose Your Own Adventure: 10 Games Where Your Decisions Really Matter We also find out more about the brothers' history their mother and some other interesting details that fill in their background. There are also some intriguing interactions that will vary depending on if Arcadia Bay is still around. While we enjoyed the lighter story it only made us love the boys even more which in turn makes the ending even more difficult to cope with. When things predictably begin to fall apart the boys flee and as we saw in the trailer finally reach that border. What happens next depends on you. Every Choice Counts In the first game the player was offered a choice which led to two different endings both equally traumatic. This follow-up is not quite so clear cut. While players only have a choice of two alternatives for the final decision the outcomes for each depend on previous choices. There are actually four distinctly different endings each with a mix of happiness and tragedy. There is also a slight variant to one ending and three slightly different alternatives to another. As you can imagine with this many endings every single choice counts even down to the little things that slowly impacted your relationships. Tackling Important Issues All throughout the episodes the issue of racism has been tackled while homophobia was touched upon. This final episode continues in that vein with both issues once again explored. These are sensitive topics that have been handled incredibly well. The narrative in this last episode is just as engaging sensitive and well-written as those which came before it. There's no jarring difference and no huge letdown. RELATED: Pine Switch Review: Beauty That Is Only Skin Deep This time around while the drama is not on a ""destroying an entire town"" scale it's actually more traumatizing as so much of it is rooted in the consequences of racism. I've never felt my white privilege more than I did playing this. So many of these incidents sadly do happen and that realism is what makes this harder to stomach. Watching Sean explain racism to Daniel still breaks my heart almost as much as the loss of Mushroom did. A Satisfying Finale As expected the graphics narrative and soundtrack are absolutely stunning throughout. This series is known for its attention to detail and this is never more apparent than in some of the tiny details you'll notice in Wolves. The pace can feel slightly slow at times and there are a couple of moments that made me want to scream at the boys to hurry up but it's all part of the story. Ultimately they are very minor annoyances due to my impatience and the pace is generally well thought out building up the finale well. While not all the endings are happy with one in particular being especially traumatizing they all feel realistic and in line with the choices you need to make to get to each one. Each has elements of joy and sadness and this feels right for the script. After all they left a large amount of chaos behind them which can't fail to have an effect on them or anyone playing this beautiful game."

Its visuals are at times mesmerising rooting its aesthetic in traditional Mexican art; the core gameplay loop has a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling encouraging mastery of the mechanics; and the script irons out the kinks of the first game's story in order to offer a more compelling narrative with a stronger comedic identity. Guacamelee! 2 is without a doubt one of the strongest Metroidvanias in recent memory.

Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire,PC,Sep-22-2017,ArenaNet,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer,RPG Fan,90,Path of Fire is a much better expansion than Heart of Thorns and the best part about it is it will only set you back $30. The Guild Wars 2 base game is already free to play and if you want both expansions you can get them combined for $50. You are essentially getting years worth of content for the price of one game. If you have already played Guild Wars 2 before but have left for one reason or another and are on the fence about returning I could not recommend a better time to come back. The Guild Wars 2 of 2017 is a very different game then you probably remember and that's a good thing. Change in MMOs keeps them fresh and fun for years to come and Guild Wars 2 embraces this better than any other MMO on the market. Praise Joko!

No More Heroes,Wii,Jan-22-2008,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,G4 TV,100,The real triumph of Suda 51’s surreal occasionally obscene romp is that behind all the cynicism satire and gory ultraviolence lies a true joy of creation that is too rarely seen in gaming. In playing No More Heroes one gets the impression that the development team truly enjoyed making it that no idea was thrown out for being too ridiculous or far-fetched and that it is intensely aware of its own absurdity at all times. The excellent fourth-wall shattering ending is proof enough of that.

Comet Crash,PlayStation 3,Apr-2-2009,Pelfast,Strategy | General | General,Thunderbolt,90,Comet Crash certainly isn't the most sophisticated looking tower defense title but if you pass it up because of its simplistic visuals you're truly missing out.

Darkest Dungeon,PlayStation 4,Sep-27-2016,Red Hook Studios,Role-Playing | General,IGN,91,Darkest Dungeon is a grim and merciless tactical strategy game whose great tension comes from its many layers of complexity unpredictable randomization and willingness to put our fragile characters in mortal danger if we dare to venture into its depths in search of treasure and glory. Brilliant narration and stiff yet surprisingly expressive animation make it easy to be drawn into its vague but tantalizing world though the end feels artificially out of reach.

Bleed 2,PC,Feb-8-2017,BootdiskRevolution,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hardcore Gamer,90,There are certain games that are ubiquitous for the Steam user. Pretty much everyone has Portal in their Steam library. Copies of Thomas Was Alone are more common than sand in the Mojave. Bleed 2 needs to be one of those.

Command & Conquer Remastered Collection,PC,Jun-5-2020,Petroglyph,Miscellaneous | Compilation,VG247,100,This remaster is a winner. It’s a stellar package and hopefully a template for what is to come.

Octopath Traveler,Switch,Jul-12-2018,Square Enix | Acquire,General | Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,100,Octopath Traveler is a beautiful game that somehow never gets tired. It has a labyrinthine plot that bravely attempts to give eight characters the same scope and development as eight sole protagonists would get in lesser games. It’s also a game that bravely makes the story all about those characters with the world harsh as it can be almost secondary to the insular unit and their individual arcs. That sheer ambition is all the more impressive because Octopath Traveller uses sprites. Little 2D characters made up of even littler squares. People need to play this game if only to realise that not everything spectacular needs to be photo-real.

Freedom Planet,PC,Jul-21-2014,GalaxyTrail,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameCritics,100,The most impressive thing about Freedom Planet is just how good it feels. It feels great to find the correct sequence of actions to send Lilac rocketing through a level at warp speed. It feels great hearing each song on the excellent soundtrack for the first time. It feels great to nail the perfect spin dash on an enemy and absolutely shred it. That type of exhilaration is rare and worthy of praise. There’s no shortage of retro-style games that will charm one’s socks off with beautiful sprites and catchy tunes but to combine all of that with such a deep mechanical understanding of those old Genesis platformers is a remarkable feat. GalaxyTrail please take a bow.

Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds,PlayStation 4,Nov-7-2017,Guerrilla,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Trusted Reviews,100,The Frozen Wilds is more of Horizon Zero Dawn and that is in no way a bad thing. The expansion offers some closure on certain story threads whilst telling a self-contained tale that’s perfect for this ruined world you find yourself in. There’s little in terms of mechanical upgrades to the game but Horizon never needed that in the first place...If you’re craving 15-20 hours adventuring in a world crafted by artisan game designers you can’t go wrong with The Frozen Wilds which is easily one of the best DLC packages on offer this year.
Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword,DS,Mar-25-2008,Team Ninja,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gaming Age,100,Everything is fluid and the framerate is incredibly solid considering the amount of enemies that can appear on screen at once and also considering the massive size of each boss youll encounter.

Detention,PlayStation 4,Oct-3-2017,Red Candle Games,Adventure | General,Digitally Downloaded,100,The best way to experience the game is to play it yourself in one three hour sitting without distractions or prior information. It gives the same experience as a really good movie one which you really become attached to the characters and are invested in their personalities for the entire time. There are some scary moments to keep things interesting but I would recommend this one for those who want a more psychological emotional game which challenges the way they see the world. Red Lantern have proved themselves to be masters of both narrative and game design and nothing would make me happier than for the whole world to come and appreciate the unique Taiwanese flavour that Detention brings to the indie game scene.

Little Nightmares,Xbox One,Apr-28-2017,Tarsier Studios,Action Adventure | General | Linear,XBLA Fans,100,Little Nightmares is dark eerie startling gross and sinister – all without resorting to M-rated content or a first-person camera. Its a great puzzle-platformer that is amazingly atmospheric where the scariest parts are a fun gameplay experience rather than a game-halting fright. In many ways it reminded me of Inside but I have to be honest: despite being a little more rough around the edges I like Little Nightmares more.
Stacking,PlayStation 3,Feb-8-2011,Double Fine Productions,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Puzzle | Action,1UP,100,Stacking proves that lively character and set designs catchy music and clever writing are far more important in making a good game than simply simply adding filler to extend the quantity of gameplay hours.

Sega Ages: Sonic the Hedgehog 2,Switch,Feb-20-2020,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gamer Escape,90,The big takeaway here is that a port of Sonic 2 is still a port of a classic. I still consider the Whitehead version of the game to be the definitive release but I’ll continue to fret at the fact that it’s still locked away on mobile devices.

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance,Xbox,Oct-24-2006,Raven Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Game Informer,93,The critical path is incredibly long and is joined by bonus comic missions for most of the characters.

Prince of Persia: Warrior Within,PC,Nov-30-2004,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Fantasy | Linear,Four Fat Chicks,100,Warrior Within is not a perfect game.

Its incredibly entertaining.

Flipping Death,Switch,Aug-7-2018,Zoink!,Action | General,Vooks,100,Everything about the game is a bright shining star. The story and character design the voice talent music and art design. If I was going to compare it to something which Im going to Id say its on par with that of a Tim Schaffer game. This is only a good thing. Flipping Death is a fun tale with a mostly laid-back gameplay style possibly just a tiny bit too short. Another chapter or two certainly wouldnt be a hindrance but still the replayability is there with the challenges in each.

I can’t say enough good things about this nigh-perfect game but I can say that you should stop whatever you’re doing and go and buy it. You’ll not be disappointed.
Code:Realize - Guardian of Rebirth,Switch,Feb-6-2020,Otomate,Adventure | Visual Novel,Digitally Downloaded,90,Code: Realize is a beautiful visual novel with a wonderful concept that is written wonderfully. Its a little short of the flash-and-bang which means its not the ideal introduction to the entire genre but once youre settled in to the genre and can appreciate a visual novel for a quality narrative without needing full animation or gameplay elements its hard to look past this one as a key example of the genre done well.

Odin Sphere,PlayStation 2,May-22-2007,Vanilla Ware,Role-Playing | Action RPG,AceGamez,100,If there is one phrase that can cover just about everything Odin Sphere is about it would be this: Odin Sphere has 2D sensibilities.

SOMA,Xbox One,Dec-1-2017,Frictional Games,Action Adventure | Survival,ZTGD,95,Soma is still as enthralling for me as I remember even two years later. It’s burned its story and themes into my brain ironically enough and while I forgot little bits here and there I was shocked at just how much the game has stayed with me all this time later. I could go on and more in depth but our other review has readers covered. Like re-opening and reading a great book or re-watching a fantastic movie Soma retains its strong story driven focus and themes it transpired through videogame format and I still have just as much admiration for it as I did on release and it still gets the same score it originally earned.

The kind of imagination and design on display is always great to see and youll find yourself wishing for more as soon as the credits roll.

Super Hydorah,Xbox One,Sep-20-2017,Locomalito,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,SomosXbox,90,Super Hydorah is more than a revival of the classic shoot em up games. Locomalito and Gryzor87 made one of the most important Spanish games of recent years a love letter to the classics but also a great stand alone game. Super Hydorah is fun hard and is not too long but is one of the freshest and funniest experiences that you can experience on Xbox One.
BioShock 2: Minerva's Den,Xbox 360,Aug-31-2010,2K Marin,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Game Revolution,91,Its one hell of a trip from beginning to end and by the end of its four-hour journey will only make it tougher for you to wait two years for BioShock Infinite.

Hacking offers a menu with easily recognizable icons so you always know what your button presses will do.
Hand of Fate 2,PlayStation 4,Nov-7-2017,Defiant Development,Miscellaneous | Board / Card Game,Digitally Downloaded,100,Defiant Development has proven that Hand of Fate was neither a one-off hit nor that it couldn’t be expanded on in a meaningful way. Hand of Fate 2 retains the aesthetics and soul of the original game but builds on the world’s lore its mechanics and its art in such a way that the two games feel generations apart. As I said at the start this is one of the best games Australia has ever produced. Now begins the agonising wait for the next stroke of genius from this talented team.

Capitalism II,PC,Dec-16-2001,Enlight Software,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,90,In terms of scope and comprehensiveness it has no equal in the world of business simulations and in fact the only things it really fails to address in a business sense are non-market factors like lawsuits building permits bribing politicians unions and all that good stuff -- but give them time.

Stealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones,Xbox One,Apr-3-2015,Curve Digital,Action | Platformer | 2D,DarkStation,100,Overall Stealth Inc. 2: A Game of Clones is a clever well-designed puzzle-platformer. Its color palette may be a little bland and washed-out but the gameplay certainly isn’t. With some planning a little patience and a plethora of ruthless death animations Stealth Inc. 2 is a fun and rewarding experience.
Wreckfest,PlayStation 4,Aug-27-2019,Bugbear,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Age,100,All in all Wreckfest is absolutely worth checking out on consoles. Having not played it on PC I can’t 100% say how it compares to that version of the game but as far as console racing games go Wreckfest certainly feels like one of the best this gen. The various modes the unique demolition derby events and awesome destruction modeling on display really make for an entertaining no-nonsense type of racing game. I’d highly suggest checking it out you won’t be disappointed.
Dark Souls III: The Ringed City,PC,Mar-28-2017,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Gaming Age,100,This is in my opinion the culmination of everything that has come before it. Boss design enemy design lore environments mechanics it is all pulled from the games that preceded this and it all has its own unique spin. It is truly bittersweet to come to the end of this journey that started in February of 2009 but I can think of no better send off for the series than the one it receives in The Ringed City. This is a perfect piece of DLC to round off a great game and a once-in-a-lifetime franchise. I could not be happier with how everything falls into place at the end of the world and I would highly recommend the trip to any on the fence about taking it.

Mario Kart Wii,Wii,Apr-27-2008,Nintendo,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Kart | Automobile,AceGamez,100,Mario Kart Wii has more variety more to do and ultimately more to keep you coming back than any Mario Kart before it (and as a hardcore advocate of the SNES original I never thought I would find myself saying that); but more than that it is a flagship title for the Nintendo Wii. Not only is Mario Kart Wii the most important title that will be released on the format this year but it will stand the test of time as one of the best games the Wii has to offer.
College Hoops 2K8,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2007,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Gaming Age,91,The biggest change from 2K7 to 2K8 is 2K Share. Getting rosters should have been this easy ever since all our consoles used the Internet out of the box. For some of us that one feature will be all we need to hear to commit to another version of College Hoops.
GRIS,PlayStation 4,Nov-26-2019,Nomada Studio,Action | Platformer | 2D,The Digital Fix,100,This is the first time I have given a game 10/10. I said I never would give a game that score but I cannot find anything bad to say about Gris. Its near-perfect. Brilliant art style beautiful music and brilliant gameplay. It all combines into a controllable watercolour of pure joy. Just go and play it now I wish I could experience it again for the first time.
Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage,PC,Nov-20-2012,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,92,If for some reason you absolutely cannot stand its sense of humor you may want to think twice because its as prevalent and over-the-top as ever here. Otherwise Mr. Torgues Campaign of Carnage represents Borderlands 2 at its distilled unapologetic best.
Split/Second,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Black Rock Studio,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Target,100,With tracks ravaged and different for every lap and timed explosives akin to Mario Kart Split/Second just overtook Burnout and sped through its burning wreckage.
Desktop Dungeons,PC,Oct-17-2010,QCF Design,General | Role-Playing | General | Roguelike,Quarter to Three,100,Remember when you thought this was a frivolous roguelike and not a seriously meaty strategy game that you’ll be playing for literally days? How silly of you.
Enter the Gungeon,PlayStation 4,Apr-5-2016,Dodge Roll,Action | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,PSNStores,100,Enter the Gungeon is a fantastic game that continues to offer surprises after hours and hours into the experience.

Fallout: New Vegas - Old World Blues,PC,Jul-19-2011,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,GameWatcher,95,You will love it though if you chose the Weird Wasteland perk loved the Vault filled with Garys in 3 or just dont mind playing through an extremely funny and well-written DLC pack that throws interesting surprises at you all the time rewards exploration greatly and packs more imagination and play-time in it than nearly every other full-priced game out there.
Dragon's Crown,PlayStation 3,Aug-6-2013,Vanillaware,Action RPG | Action | Role-Playing | Beat-'Em-Up | Action RPG | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,NZGamer,95,Dragon’s Crown is certainly the most enjoyable Vanillaware game yet. Being part of a larger party - where their previous hack n’ slashers had you go it alone - is definitely the difference maker.
Sega Genesis Collection,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,Digital Eclipse,Miscellaneous | Compilation,GameShark,100,One of the best game collections ive had the pleasure of playing this year.

V-Rally 3,Game Boy Advance,Sep-30-2002,Velez & Dubail,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,G4 TV,100,A technically impressive racing game for the GBA but even more impressive is that underneath the pretty images sits a racing game that would be great on any platform.
My Hero One's Justice 2,PlayStation 4,Mar-13-2020,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameCrate,83,My Hero One’s Justice 2 is an anime arena fighter with really good ideas. It probably won’t see anyone if they aren’t already My Hero Academia fans but anyone who is already in the fanbase will eat it up. And hey if you aren’t a fan but get a chance to play anyway give it a shot it might just surprise you.
Blinx 2: Masters of Time & Space,Xbox,Nov-18-2004,Artoon,Action | Platformer | 3D,Play Magazine,91,This is just masterful game making pure and simple. [Dec 2004 p.66]
Ghostbusters: The Video Game Remastered,Xbox One,Oct-4-2019,Saber Interactive,Action | General,TheXboxHub,80,Ghostbusters: The Video Game Remastered on Xbox One remains as fun and nostalgic as it did in 2009.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,DS,Nov-8-2005,Magic Pockets,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Next Level Gaming,81,It makes really nice use of the DS features both in the story mode and the mini-games and shows you exactly what the system was intended to do.

Suikoden Tactics,PlayStation 2,Nov-8-2005,Konami,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,RPG Fan,90,I wish the game had been a bit longer but there is a new game+ option and I didnt manage to get everything the first time around so there should be some good replay value in it for me.
NBA Playgrounds,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Saber Interactive,Sports | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Video Chums,80,If you dig arcade basketball then NBA Playgrounds is a great addition to the genre.

G-Force,Xbox 360,Jul-21-2009,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | General | Platformer | 3D,ZTGD,80,G-Force was a shock to me.

Deadly Premonition,Xbox 360,Feb-17-2010,Access Games,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Open-World,Destructoid,100,There is absolutely nothing in this industry that can compare to how weird and wonderful the whole experience is. Judged as a piece of entertainment as a game that consistently surprises and amazes and leaves jaws hanging I have no choice but to say that Deadly Premonition goes above and beyond. This game is so bad its not just become good. Its pretty close to perfect.
AiRace Speed,3DS,Sep-19-2013,QubicGames,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,Gaming Nexus,80,AiRace Speed may not seem like much but for $4.99 the difficulty curve ensures you’re not just breezing through the game. Some of the turns seem incredibly sharp and will put your maneuvering skills to the test but overall AiRace Speed is a fairly fun game. Just keep the 3D turned off.
World Racing 2,PC,Aug-14-2006,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Gamer's Hell,86,Despite the minor aesthetic flaws World Racing 2 is a success in terms of improvement over its predecessor.

WARTILE,PC,Feb-8-2018,Playwood Project,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,The Games Machine,83,Despite some camera issues and a low longevity Wartile is an enjoyable game and a perfect mix between two worlds: RTS and board games. Even if you love just one of them you should give it a chance.
The Wizards: Enhanced Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-12-2019,Carbon Studio,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Hobby Consolas,84,The Wizards delivers one of the most solid experience we enjoyed in VR.

The Punisher,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2005,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Maxim Online,100,Its not all brutality. The Punisher is also one of the most immersive strategy games ever created. Aim for the head and enjoy.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Jedi Alliance,DS,Nov-11-2008,LucasArts,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,80,I have seldom awarded a game a higher overall score than it earned in the gameplay category but Jedi Alliance is one rare example whose production values actually counterbalance some of the gameplay shortcomings.
Curious Expedition,Switch,Apr-2-2020,Maschinen-Mensch,Adventure | General,Nintendojo,83,Despite its flaws though Curious Expedition is a fun adventure and a well-crafted experience. With deep gameplay mechanics lots of characters to choose from and a high replayability factor this is worth a look if you like exploration adventures.
Sword of the Stars,PC,Aug-17-2006,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,PC Gamer,89,While Sword of the Stars doesnt possess the battlefield variety of the Homeworld games that inspired it it remains an ambitious and engrossing strategy triumph. [Nov. 2006 p.78]
Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Jaleco Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,GameZone,88,Hands down this is by far the best console RTS that I have played to date and it really helps console owners who haven’t played PC RTS titles to see what all the fun is about.
Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup,PlayStation 2,Oct-28-2003,Magic Pockets,Sports | Alternative | Other,Worth Playing,84,Definitely personifies the magnificence of the sport but it is lacking because its not as advanced as I had hoped it would be.
ATV Quad Power Racing 2,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2003,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,TotalGames.net,81,It’s not going to rock your world but it looks good sounds good plays great and is sure to put a big old smile on your face.

Freakyforms: Your Creations Alive!,3DS,Nov-10-2011,Asobism | Co. ltd.,Miscellaneous | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,89,The greatest character and planet creation kit ever. If the exploration had been better this would be gold but then youd probably be paying £30 for it.
Gauntlet (2014),PC,Sep-23-2014,Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,GamingTrend,90,Few games can come close to creating the same mayhem and excitement as Gauntlet can.
Typoman: Revised,Switch,Feb-22-2018,Brainseed Factory,Action | Platformer | 2D,The Games Machine,80,Typoman Revised is a brainy and well-designed platformer offering few hours of clever fun and some degree of replayability. The Switch version is by far the better one more polished and with some new ingredients that will please the players. Unfortunately the touch screen is noo longer supported (but it was on the Wii U version).
Men of War: Assault Squad 2,PC,Mar-20-2014,1C | 1C Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,Pelit (Finland),89,Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is just about the best multiplayer experience the World War II games have to offer. [June 2014]

Switchball,PlayStation 3,Sep-18-2009,Atomic Elbow,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,D+PAD Magazine,80,It is in many ways a very meek and understated game…but under its mild-mannered exterior lies an engaging diverting and enjoyable title that for the price offers a heap of entertainment.
Tom Clancy's HAWX 2,Xbox 360,Sep-7-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,XGN,85,If youre on the lookout for a great flight game look no further. H.A.W.X. 2 is the best game of its kind and will keep you wannabe pilots busy for weeks to come.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance,Xbox One,Feb-13-2018,Warhorse Studios,Historic | Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Action RPG,Xbox Tavern,100,Warhorse have developed a game that’s not only massively in-depth but equally as intriguing and captivating. Their care and attention to detail pulls through in each and every sequence within. This level of realism isn’t going to be for everyone but for those that want the authentic experience Deliverance delivers and then some. It’s engaging it’s deep and it’s thoroughly entertaining.
Space Hulk: Tactics,PlayStation 4,Oct-9-2018,Cyanide | Cyanide Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Digitally Downloaded,80,Space Hulk: Tactics is the most impressive Warhammer 40K effort Ive played in recent memory.
Warhammer 40000: Armageddon,PC,Nov-26-2014,The Lordz Games Studio | Flashback Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | General,Digitally Downloaded,80,Is it disappointing that units in Warhammer 40000 are so simple in presentation? Sure especially when you consider how monotone many of the apocalyptic environments are. But given the choice between a game like this an a major studio producing a Warhammer game that fails to even understand where the real appeal of Warhammer lies Ill take a game like Warhammer 40000: Armageddon any time.
Galcon Fusion,PC,Feb-11-2010,Phil Hassey,Strategy | General | General,PC Format,90,Looks rather simple but is in fact very deep. [Apr 2010 p.101]

Star Wars Pinball,3DS,Sep-19-2013,Zen Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Pinball | Pinball,DarkStation,80,Despite some technical hiccups I actually think handheld is a better version of the game than a console experience and if you have the system for it definitely get this one on the go.

Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta,PC,Aug-3-2009,Bethesda Softworks,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,Game Revolution,83,A great way to end the downloadable content run for Fallout 3. If its indeed the final DLC were to see for the game its surely an out-of-this-world way to close off our explorations of the Capital Wasteland providing a thoroughly enjoyable ride that is likely to last almost as much as the longest of the packs thats come out so far - Broken Steel.
GORN,PlayStation 4,May-19-2020,Free Lives,Action | General,PlayStation Universe,85,GORN is a bloody good time arriving right at the moment when we need it most. Some strategy is hidden beneath all of the gore and carnage though you might find yourself just dipping into GORN to bash some heads for a few minutes. While there are some technical limitations brought on by the PlayStation Camera GORN works pretty well on the PSVR. As both a workout and a psychological enema GORN succeeds wildly.
NASCAR 07,PlayStation 2,Sep-6-2006,EA Tiburon,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,Next Level Gaming,85,Minus the graphics NASCAR 07 is just as solid as its predecessors. The skill points are nice as are the driver attributes. And a new story mode is always good.
Wii Sports Club,Wii U,Nov-7-2013,Nintendo,Sports | General | General,Nintendojo,83,With only two sports currently available Wii Sports Club isn’t as robust an experience as it could be but what is there will still keep players entertained for hours. With the promise of additional sports in the future there’s a lot of potential for Wii Sports Club and it’s easily worth a download for anyone who owns a Wii U.
Lost in Shadow,Wii,Jan-4-2011,Hudson Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,Multiplayer.it,85,A Shadows Tale is an engaging and enjoyable platform game with a nice artistic direction and a good number of original elements that fit effectively into the gameplay.
Bone: Out From Boneville,PC,Sep-15-2005,Telltale Games,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person,Just Adventure,100,I personally have nothing but good things to say about this game. In fact the only problem I have is that it’s too short and that just means I’m greedy. I think anyone who wants to be whisked away into a brightly colored land of adventure featuring the time-honored themes of good and evil friends and foes and a good dose of real humor will be doing themselves a serious favor by checking out this game.
Hatoful Boyfriend,PC,Feb-15-2012,Hato Moa,General | Adventure | General | Visual Novel,Multiplayer.it,85,Do you ever dream about a love story with a dove? Do you ever feel that your life will be better with a bird on your side? If the answers are yes try Hatoful Boyfriend.

A must-have for all fans of robots-went-angry situation. [June 2012]
Test Drive Unlimited 2,Xbox 360,Feb-8-2011,Eden Studios | Eden,Driving | Racing | Simulation | General | General | Automobile,MondoXbox,88,A very enjoyable game despite some blind spots in the graphics and sound areas: the social aspects and the many many things to do in Ibiza and Oahu will keep your interest high for a long time.
Pathway,PC,Apr-11-2019,Robotality,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Strategy Gamer,100,I can’t find many faults with Pathway beyond the occasional bit of bad luck with the map generation that puts camps and traders too far off-track to be worth going to or throws a particularly tough combat at you straight away. Apart from that small issue this game is frankly amazing and it kept me up until dawn trying to find out what the Wrath of God was and I am so distraught that I died just before the finale. Let’s just say I chose… poorly.
Juiced,Xbox,Jun-13-2005,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,GameBiz,85,A pretty good street racing game.

Major League Baseball 2K12,Xbox 360,Mar-6-2012,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Game Chronicles,85,And thats precisely the group that 2K Sports is trying to target with MLB 2K12 – the hardcore baseball fans. With the slow tactical pitching game the new fielding mechanics and the complex base running – MLB 2K12 is definitely not for the casual gamer. And hardcore fans should really find something to like in MLB 2K12 because it is as accurate a hardball experience as can be found in gaming.
Wii Party,Wii,Oct-3-2010,Nd Cube,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Play.tm,89,But what it does have it wears on its sleeve - hundreds of hand crafted miniature challenges - and thats what I keep coming back for.
Tokyo Crash Mobs,3DS,Jan-17-2013,Mitchell,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Destructoid,85,A game that I truly did not see coming. Fans of surreal FMV and/or match three puzzle games should check it out.
Buzz! Master Quiz,PSP,Sep-23-2008,Relentless Software,Miscellaneous | Trivia / Game Show | Trivia / Game Show,Cheat Code Central,82,Its fun to pick up and play whenever you have a moment but with the lowered production values you might have just as much fun with a mobile trivia game.
Costume Quest 2,PC,Oct-7-2014,Double Fine Productions,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Japanese-Style,Digital Trends,80,Costume Quest 2 is a classic JRPG stripped of all the tedious baggage and wrapped in Double Fine’s impeccable writing and sense of whimsy.
Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights,Xbox 360,Sep-17-2007,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,NZGamer,85,Better than the sum of its parts the game offers an arcade experience with a little more room to muck around and a little more scope for customising things than is usually offered.
Grand Theft Auto,Game Boy Advance,Oct-26-2004,Digital Eclipse,Action Adventure | Modern,Next Level Gaming,90,The game that we have been waiting for. It is the best GTA game on a portable system and it made a smooth transition from console to portable.
Snack World: The Dungeon Crawl Gold,Switch,Feb-14-2020,Level 5,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Japanese-Style,Hardcore Gamer,90,There’s just so much that Snack World does right for a dungeon crawler that even without having any sort of serious story it manages to be one of the best in the genre with the sheer fun variety it offers. Anyone looking for a brand new adventuring title should give Snack World: The Dungeon Crawl – Gold their time as it’s surprisingly fantastic.
Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy,Switch,Mar-26-2020,Aspyr,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,NF Magazine,80,This is where the fun begins. [Issue #46 – May/June 2020 p. 27]
American Fugitive,Xbox One,May-24-2019,Fallen Tree Games,Action Adventure | Sandbox | Open-World,Xbox Tavern,80,Whilst I take issue with the game’s pacing and its hit and miss AI there’s little else to scoff at here. American Fugitive is a love letter to fans of classic Grand Theft Auto. The game’s stunning world is full of varied activities and events with no shortage of choice to take to throughout each and every aspect within. This is all held together by remarkably fluid gameplay putting forward a sandbox that’s deep robust and constantly action-packed.
NASCAR Heat 3,Xbox One,Sep-7-2018,704Games,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,XboxAddict,75,With a couple small personal preference issues I still believe that NASCAR Heat 3 is a fairly solid game. Is it perfect? No game is. With the sheer amount of content modes and overall experience while in gameplay I would have no issue recommending this game to someone if youre a fan of the sport. If you want a fun racing game that you can just sit back relax drink a beer or two and race this is the game for you. 3... 2... 1... Race!
The Council - Episode 3: Ripples,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,GameCritics,85,The Council once again manages to make player actions feel vital in a way that few narrative choice titles accomplish – in fact there are some diverging plot points that are so significant I have a difficult time imagining how many versions of conversations will have to be crafted for the last two episodes. This is also an episodic series where major characters can die and that adds a level of danger to every interaction that few in its genre can match. Episode four can’t arrive quickly enough!
The 25th Ward: The Silver Case,PlayStation 4,Mar-13-2018,Grasshopper Manufacture,Adventure | Visual Novel,Digitally Downloaded,90,To say that The 25th Ward is niche would be an understatement but that’s what’s so impressive about it. It respects the intelligence of its players allowing them to wade through the feverish surrealism that the game often depicts and melds that perfectly with a traditional noir thriller than Raymond Chandler himself would have been proud of. Goichi Suda might be known for his action games today (and they’re usually very fine games in their own right) but what I wouldn’t give for him to go back for another spin or two at the visual novel.
One Piece: Unlimited World Red - Deluxe Edition,Switch,Sep-29-2017,Ganbarion,Action | General,God is a Geek,80,One Piece: Unlimited World Red Deluxe Edition on Switch is the best way to experience Unlimited World Red and exactly how a licensed game should be.
LEVEL 22 Gary's Misadventures,Xbox One,Jan-29-2016,Moving Player | Noego,Action | General,We Got This Covered,80,Level 22: Garys Misadventures is a delightful twist on a genre that can take itself way too seriously at times. It manages to make fun of how ridiculous stealth games can be and provides a solid challenge itself even if it doesnt last that long.
Kromaia Omega,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2015,Kraken Empire,Action | Shooter | Rail,PSNStores,90,In all Kromaia Ω is a diamond in the current outpouring of PSN titles that shouldn’t be overlooked based on its price tag. There are a couple of other game modes included in this new package but the main campaign will take around eight enjoyable hours to complete. I didn’t even mention the unlockable grapple hook a feature that opens up new levels of piloting expertise.
Five Nights at Freddy's 3,PC,Mar-2-2015,Scott Cawthon,Action | General,PC Gamer,77,The excellently revised camera system and eerie villain makes Five Nights at Freddy’s 3 one of the better scare-fests out there.
Assassin's Creed Unity: Dead Kings,PlayStation 4,Jan-13-2015,Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Historic | Open-World,IGN Italia,90,Its got a couple of badly designed puzzles but its a meaty DLC and it comes for free!
Neverending Nightmares,PC,Sep-26-2014,Infinitap Games,Horror | Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,Game Revolution,90,While I do believe some players may dismiss the game as a walking simulator (as they are wont to do nowadays) Neverending Nightmares falls into the must-play section of the horror genre. Whether or not you find it scary you’ll definitely be disturbed and intrigued as you seek resolution to the madness.
Major League Baseball 2K12,PlayStation 3,Mar-6-2012,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),80,While 2K12 plays a solid game and displays improvements over the past version it doesnt add enough to achieve its lofty aspirations. [Apr 2012 p.85]
Bejeweled Blitz Live,Xbox 360,Feb-23-2011,Torpex Games LLC,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Matching,Planet Xbox 360,87,If youre a dedicated Bejeweled player or youre looking for a great party game to tackle with your friends Bejeweled Blitz Live is a smart choice. Its only 800 Microsoft points ($10) and well worth every penny as you gain new skills and bump up your score into the stratosphere.
Tenchu: Shadow Assassins,PSP,Mar-24-2009,From Software | Acquire,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Vandal,85,The new Tenchu installment will surprise positively series followers apart from genre fans. It is a slow game in which well have to think twice each of our steps in order to survive. It has great hours of action and fun and also offers a story worth being followed up to the end.
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Sep-16-2008,Krome Studios,Action | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),80,If you havent upgraded to a PS3 the action story and exclusive levels here wont disappoint. [Oct 2008 p.76]

My Word Coach,Wii,Nov-6-2007,Ubisoft,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,GamingTrend,81,I was taken aback by the difficulty of the intro. The tutorial word in the fill-in-the-blank game is Villain. That was something a little over the top for my 7 year old.
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,DS,Oct-17-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameZone,73,Its a fun game that takes advantage of the DS touch screen without being gimmicky. Hats off to the developers for keeping the spirit of Spyro alive and well.
Midway Arcade Treasures 3,Xbox,Sep-27-2005,Digital Eclipse,Miscellaneous | Compilation,DailyGame,90,Bitchin fun dude! Takes you right back to the roaring road-rage days of the arcade.

And when youve completed the game with a high score theres some decent cheats to unlock that enrich it even more.
Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004,Game Boy Advance,Feb-10-2004,KCEJ,Miscellaneous | Card Battle,GameZone,85,Where it separates itself from the real game is that it allows you to duel the characters from the show with surprising accuracy you don’t have the problems of picking up or keeping track of your cards and it allows players to play with cards they either can’t afford or haven’t come across yet. A huge bonus.
Dark Fall: The Journal,PC,Jul-25-2003,XXV Productions,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,Just Adventure,100,The best independent adventure game since Cracking the Conspiracy.
Gallop Racer 2003: A New Breed,PlayStation 2,Mar-31-2003,Tecmo,Sports | Alternative | Horse Racing,Game Informer,85,With a near-limitless plethora of horses tons of strategy and loads of gameplay extras this is a sure bet. [May 2003 p.83]
ATV Quad Power Racing 2,Xbox,Jan-27-2003,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Armchair Empire,80,Despite the insanely difficult and nearly impossible Challenge mode and the sometimes-unfair violent behavior on the part of the A.I.-controlled racers a good visual presentation great trick system and tough races make ATV: Quad Power Racing 2 a good addition to the Xbox racing library.
Army Men: RTS,PlayStation 2,Mar-27-2002,Pandemic Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,GameZone,85,The real joy of Army Men RTS is the creativity of the game. The cut scenes are downright hilarious and the movie spoofs are frequent.
Ultimate Ride,PC,Sep-30-2001,Gigawatt Studios,Action | Strategy | General | Management | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,84,Its as realistic as a virtual coaster could possibly be and once its over you cant wait to get back in line to ride it again.
Ball Breakers,PlayStation,Jul-26-2000,Lost Toys,Action | General,PSX Nation,82,A nice new fighting type game that is unique and entertaining.
Bang! Gunship Elite,PC,Jul-19-2000,Rayland Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Hot Games,90,One of the better looking shooters around with spectacular special effects Gunship is a worthy contender for Freespaces throne.
Monster Hunter,PlayStation 2,Sep-21-2004,Capcom,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameScience,85,Whilst certainly not free of issues Monster Hunter is equal measures out-and-out fun and out-and-out terror delivered fantastically well in both online and offline modes. The game provides a PSO-style game for the PS2 and offering pick-up-and-play online gaming without the need to commit to hours at a time.
Vandal Hearts: Flames of Judgment,Xbox 360,Jan-20-2010,Hijinx Studios,Role-Playing | Strategy | Turn-Based | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Tactics,RPGamer,80,Vandal Hearts is an affirmation that a small company without gobs of funds can take a game premise and turn it into a true treasure.
Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit,PlayStation 2,Sep-29-2005,Frontier Developments,Action Adventure | Modern,Times Online,80,Park and his team’s creative modelling skills make the films magical but in replacing them with computer graphics this game delivers pretty average fare. That said its cartoon visuals and helpful prompts should keep younger children amused for hours.
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,PlayStation 3,Sep-25-2012,Arkedo Studio,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Game Informer,85,Hell Yeah is an enjoyable 2D sidescroller that waxes nostalgic about classic games just as much as it establishes its own identity as a how-to guide to murdering monsters in ridiculous ways.
Ice Age 2: The Meltdown,PlayStation 2,Mar-14-2006,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,Worth Playing,84,A playable enjoyable at times downright fun game spreading brand recognition of the movie and all at once giving your little nephew something to play while hes visiting your house for the weekend.
The Cave (2013),PC,Jan-23-2013,Double Fine Productions,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,PC Master (Greece),82,A dialogue system and a fully functional inventory would not only vastly enhance the game we could be talking about the birth of a new sub-genre. Even so we enjoyed it. From now on when someone asks what the heck of a game is The Cave we will answer a really great game… after all that’s what really matters. [March 2013]
Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny,PlayStation 2,Apr-25-2006,Gust,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,netjak,89,Its the kind of game that made me feel disappointed it was over. If all games that were just polished versions of older games like Atelier Iris 2 is then Id never want for an original game again.
Commander: Conquest of the Americas,PC,Jul-30-2010,Nitro Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General | General | Command,GameWatcher,85,This is a must have for both fans and newcomers a like but dont expect the second coming. This is a solid and improved version of East India Company nothing more.

Treasure World,DS,Jun-30-2009,Aspyr,Simulation | General | General,Nintendojo,84,By utilizing tech that is now much older than the five years that DS has been around Aspyr managed to create a unique experience something it should be commended for.
Zendoku,DS,Jun-26-2007,Zoonami Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Logic | Logic,Digital Entertainment News,85,This is an addiction not a game. As hard as you may fall for it there are rewards for sticking with it but the later levels will make it harder to do so.
NBA 07,PSP,Sep-25-2006,SCEA,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,GameZone,89,By far one of the most delightfully engaging and deep basketball games on the PSP so far NBA ‘07 is not only an improvement over last year’s fun offering but it’s also a game that is good enough to give the other NBA b-ball games a run for their money.
Justice League Heroes,Xbox,Oct-17-2006,Snowblind Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Next Level Gaming,84,The environments are beautiful and highly detailed also are the destructible elements like the vehicles trees and newspaper stands.
Dark Summit,GameCube,Feb-4-2002,Radical Entertainment,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,GameShark,80,Whats nice is the character animations the huge environments and the overall ominous feel. Great sound effects add to the atmosphere.
TSIOQUE,PC,Nov-7-2018,OhNoo,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Digital Chumps,90,Overall the gameplay of TSIOQUE is a layer of entertaining complication. It offers up a little bit of new and a little bit of old and sprinkles it with a helluva protagonist that is fun to play. It doesn’t necessarily redefine the point and click genre but it shows that there is more to it than you might remember. The gameplay is simply a methodically well put together masterpiece that will certainly make you wish for those LucasArts days when they ruled the roost in this genre.
Need for Speed,PC,Mar-15-2016,Ghost Games,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,IGN Spain,82,Quotation forthcoming.
Ice Age 2: The Meltdown,Xbox,Mar-14-2006,Vivendi Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Next Level Gaming,90,It stars popular characters makes good use of music and sound effects and has a lot of gameplay variety. Add those things together with some nice looking graphics and youve got a solid title.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,PlayStation 2,Nov-8-2005,Electronic Arts,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PGNx Media,80,The game changes a few of the things Harry fans have come to expect from the games and though aimed at a younger audience Harry fans will find a lot to like in the game.
Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power,PC,Aug-20-2015,Frozenbyte | Inc.,Action Adventure | General | Action | Platformer | 2D,Softpedia,90,Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power is a worthy successor to the first two games in the series. The addition of 3D environments while a bit tricky at first ends up enhancing the experience. There are still a few quirks such as camera angles or some complex platforming sequences but overall its still a blast to play through the new title both for veterans as well as newcomers.
Pure Pool,Xbox One,Nov-14-2014,VooFoo Studios,Alternative | Other | Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards,MondoXbox,85,A very good pool simulation with great ball and shot physics. It could have used some more play modes but it remains a recommended game at a very good price.
Arcana Heart 3: LOVE MAX!!!!!,PlayStation 3,Sep-23-2014,Examu,Action | Fighting | 2D,Game Over Online,76,This isn’t quite as polished as something from Capcom or SNK Playmore but it’s still a really fun fighter that fans of the genre will enjoy.

Labyrinth Legends,PlayStation 3,Dec-18-2012,Creat Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,77,Labyrinth Legends is a short but pure and enjoyable dungeon crawl that will challenge you in ways that many developers have discarded as relics of the past.
Nightshade,PlayStation 2,Feb-10-2004,Wow Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Gamezilla!,90,After spending a fairly short amount of time with the game I found the controls very smooth but what really makes this game such a blast to play is the inventive combat system.
The Invincible Iron Man,Game Boy Advance,Dec-15-2002,Torus Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendophiles,75,Definitely a unique action-hero game that has Mega Man/Bob SNES qualities and style of gameplay. It can rival some of the better-known superhero GBA games on the market today.
Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2,GameCube,Sep-30-2002,EA Seattle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Entertainment Weekly,83,Killer aerial shots intense chases and a rock-infused soundtrack make for a heart-pounding ride. [18 Oct 2002 p.124]
Spider-Man,PC,Sep-17-2001,Gray Matter,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gaming Age,83,The best Spider-Man game ever created. Never before has a game captured the form of Spidey the ‘Spidey-ness’ if you will.
The Biggest Loser: Ultimate Workout,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Blitz Games Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,MS Xbox World,85,Of all the Kinect games to date Ultimate Workout is definitely the most concise program out there.
Rain of Reflections: Chapter 1,PC,Oct-4-2019,Lionbite Games,Strategy | Action Adventure | Turn-Based | General,TheSixthAxis,90,Rain of Reflection: Chapter 1 has a winning formula of narrative and gameplay that despite not being a traditional pairing form an excellent symbiosis. The systems will all be familiar to fans of interactive storytelling games and XCOM-likes but they’ve all been implemented so cleanly that they feel fresh. The only real negative is its short runtime which leaves you wishing the developers had waited to release the entire game at once.
Effie,PlayStation 4,Jun-4-2019,Factoria Cultural Gestio | S.L.,Action | Platformer | 3D,Hobby Consolas,80,Effie is without any doubt one of the best games that has come out of the PlayStation Talents initiative. A full-fledged adventure with platform action and puzzles that apart from being fun and entertaining has a unique visual style that sets it apart from the rest. Pity that the camera and the control in the combat is not a better film.

Smoke and Sacrifice,PlayStation 4,Jan-15-2019,Solar Sail Games,Action Adventure | General,XGN,80,Smoke and Sacrifice is a surprisingly complete game. It offers a ton of crafting options and challenges you on every step you take. The story is interesting and plays out in a wonderful hand drawn world. It is not perfect but definitely worth your time.

The game wants to bring the thrill the sensation and the enjoyment of rallying to all of the fans of the sport regardless of their driving ability. It wants all players to be able to compete in this seasons events and to feel a part of the motorsport and WRC 6 has achieved this surprisingly well.
EA Sports Active 2,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Canada,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,1UP,91,After a workout with the game I always walk away feeling like I just went through the same intensive full-body workout that Id only get from hitting the gym five days a week. Its this feeling that sets EA Sports Active 2 apart from the rest of the exercise games on the market and its why if youre serious about getting into shape (and you can deal with the hefty price tag) you should definitely try EA Sports Active 2.
Tony Hawk's Project 8,PSP,Nov-21-2006,Page 44 Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,PGNx Media,84,It’s very impressive that Page 44 Studios managed to introduce nail the trick and focus mode to the PSP and make it as intuitive as possible.

With an updated version of the game online co-op cross play between the PS3 and Vita and universal level and gun unlocks players can enjoy the game in just about any way they want.

A Golden Wake,PC,Oct-9-2014,Grundislav Games,Miscellaneous | Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,Joystiq,90,A Golden Wake interprets a rich history in its chapters and paints an image of the best and worst of the 1920s and while its overly-easy puzzles didnt really add to the story I felt a stronger appreciation for that era after playing through it.
Lead and Gold: Gangs of the Wild West,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Fatshark AB,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Pelit (Finland),81,Swedish western shootout works like a charm.

[June 2010]
Golf With Your Friends,Xbox One,May-19-2020,Blacklight Interactive,Sports | Individual | Golf | Arcade,IGN Italia,82,Rich in ideas and options Golf With Your Friends is an excellent multiplayer game with some rough edges here and there.
TT Isle of Man,PC,Mar-27-2018,Kylotonn,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Jeuxvideo.com,85,Realistic and exhilarating TT Isle of Man lets you experience the rush of speed and danger without the risk of falling off the ramp. We cant guarantee your gamepad is safe though.
Light Tracer,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Oasis Games,Puzzle | Action,VRFocus,80,Overall Light Tracer is a well-crafted VR platform title. Once you get used to the controls it becomes challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. There are some very frustrating elements but not enough to spoil the gameplay entirely. Having said that Light Tracer is at its best when played in relatively small doses. Like a plate of snacks to nibble on instead of a feast but still just as tasty.
911 Operator,PC,Feb-24-2017,Jutsu Games,Simulation | Virtual | Career,Games.cz,80,A nice surprise that will please only patient players with the nerves of steel. Playing under pressure is addictive and at such times the straightforwardness is pushed aside. What ’s more you can do good in your own hometown!
iO,PlayStation 4,Feb-14-2017,Gamious,Puzzle | Action,PSNStores,80,iO works great in situations where you might only have a few minutes to work through a level or two. It’s fun to jump in solve a course and move on to the next. The focus on momentum makes this feel pretty unique and the game’s 225 courses get a good deal of mileage out of the grow/shrink mechanic. Considering this is a game that I only heard about a week ago this turned out to be a pleasant little surprise.
Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis,Wii,Oct-16-2007,Rockstar San Diego,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Other | Tennis,Worth Playing,90,Ultimately its a good version of a good game that originated on a very different platform — an even better game really just as Resident Evil 4 for Wii is the definitive version of an already excellent title.

DanceStar Party Hits,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2012,SCEE,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Pelit (Finland),84,Sonys debut in the dancing game franchise is quite good. This easy-going dance experience works quite nicely with Move although theres no match for the precision what Kinect gives. This game proves the fact that dancing is fun. Instead of making the right moves the focus is on the experience. [Dec 2011]
Samba de Amigo,Wii,Sep-23-2008,Gearbox Software,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Nintendo Power,90,Of course the big question on the minds of Samba devotees is how the controls stack up to the Dreamcast version and its beloved maracas peripheral. The answer: extremely well. [Nov 2008 p.95]
Fable Anniversary,Xbox 360,Feb-4-2014,Lionhead Studios,Action RPG | Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameOver.gr,90,Some 10 year old problems are still here proving that Lionhead didnt do its best during the port but Fable -even after all those years- remains one unique fairytale of a game.

Deadlight,Xbox 360,Aug-1-2012,Tequila Works,Action | General | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,XboxAddict,90,The quality of content is amazing and when you combine the psychotic storyline with the fluid gameplay and top it off with amazing use of the Unreal engine for graphics and a soundtrack that will drive suspense deep into your soul Deadlight is easily one of the best Xbox Live Arcade games to come out this summer or arguably this year.

Zwei: The Arges Adventure,PC,Jan-24-2018,Falcom,Action RPG | Role-Playing | General,GameSpew,80,While there’s a lot to love within The Arges Adventure it’s mostly superficial due to a frustrating combat system that forces most of the game to become a slog.

Red Wings: Aces of the Sky,Switch,May-21-2020,All in! Games,Simulation | Flight | Combat,NintendoWorldReport,80,Red Wings: Aces of the Sky is a surprisingly addictive game. It is a prime example of a very simple gameplay loop executed extremely well. It is a focused experience and I think that is for the best. While I did run into some mild colorblind accessibility issues they didn’t slow down my enjoyment too much. Arguably where it stumbles most is in trying to force in diversity via the bombing missions. When Red Wings accepts its own simplicity it is brilliant. The local co-op makes for a wonderful and unexpected addition and strong art design helps to maintain its charm for many hours. Red Wings: Aces of the Sky is no doubt destined to become a hidden gem of the Switch eShop.
Dry Drowning,PC,Aug-2-2019,Studio V,Adventure | Visual Novel,SpazioGames,85,Dry Drowning is a very good game with great narrative experience.

Strong personality in the combat mechanics but aged and turned slightly simplistic. Great character design with good HD fine tuning. The price sadly is a total turnoff.
Oninaki,Switch,Aug-22-2019,Tokyo RPG Factory,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Japanese-Style,Nintendo Enthusiast,90,On the surface Oninaki might seem like a rough-around-the-edges action RPG lacking depth to its combat alongside an anime-inspired melodramatic story. However for those who are patient enough to explore its world characters and ability-based battle system there’s a lot to like an dive into after all. If you have even the slightest curiosity in this title Oninaki‘s refreshing take on JRPGs is most definitely worth your time.

Seeking Dawn,PC,Jul-12-2018,Multiverse Games | Multiverse,Action Adventure | General,Impulsegamer,86,Seeking Dawn is essentially a mix of different game styles primarily a first person shooter but also a game of exploration and crafting. You could be excused for just wanting to walk around and explore the beautiful landscape and examine the wildlife… but you do have a job to do and as big as the world is it does guide you (gently) towards your goal.

Outlast 2,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2017,Red Barrels,Action Adventure | Survival,GameGrin,90,Outlast 2 could well be the scariest horror game I have played to date. There were a few very minor gripes but the isolation desolation and desperation were noticeable throughout. The sense of fear was more impactful than in the first game and there were parts where I played hiding behind anything I could get my hands on. I went to Temple Gate and I did not enjoy my stay. And by that statement alone I have to applaud Red Barrels for creating such a brilliant game.

They were just flashy vehicles for whatever Shonen Jump series Bandai Namco had gotten the rights to. And yet underneath all that is a complex yet accessible game that rewards exploration experimentation and practice. A proper fighting game in other words. If you’re looking for another 3D fighter give this one a shot. If you’re a My Hero Academia fan however you absolutely can’t miss My Hero One’s Justice. This could be the start of something beautiful after all.

Tennis in the Face,PlayStation 4,Dec-9-2014,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Action | General,Gaming Age,83,Tennis in the Face may not push the PS4 to its limits (I doubt the eventual Vita version will even do that either) but its still a lot more enjoyable than any number of other more complex games — and quite frankly Ill take enjoyable over complex any day of the week.
Azkend 2: The World Beneath,Switch,Jan-12-2018,10tons,Puzzle | Matching,GameGrin,75,Azkend 2 has a threadbare story that basically gives context for going from one puzzle to the next and it definitely won’t be the reason anyone picks this game up. The events are narrated by the female protagonist whose voice was more akin to that of a children’s TV presenter. The wonderful artwork fuses well with the game’s musical score both of which set a suitably mysterious and adventurous tone.
Slain: Back from Hell,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,God is a Geek,80,Slain: Back from Hell is a more metal and modern Castlevania that looks and plays great but is held back by a few sections which feel unfairly difficulty.

Potata: Fairy Flower,Switch,Jun-6-2020,OverGamez,Action | Platformer | 2D,Pure Nintendo,80,While it may not be critically riveting Potato: Fairy Flower is a game that is simply meant to be played and enjoyed. There is some storytelling some sense of adventure some pattern learning and an adversary to overcome. There are also some areas where it could use some polishing but taken for what it is this is a fun game.
The Complex,Xbox One,Mar-31-2020,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Adventure | General,God is a Geek,95,The story and acting are superb and with so many endings it’s almost impossible to predict how each decision will play out and affect the overall conclusion. A must play for fans of live-action games.

Vanishing Point,PlayStation,Feb-5-2001,Clockwork Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Sports Gaming Network,90,I have yet to notice any pop-up or draw-in in the game.

Record of Agarest War,PlayStation 3,Apr-27-2010,Compile Heart,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,Gaming Age,75,I think Record of Agarest War is definitely a pretty niche SRPG thats not going to appeal to players that arent already familiar with this particular game type. However I dont think its meant to bring in new players and as far as fan service games go this is pretty tame and playable by teens on up.
Knights of Pen & Paper 2,PC,Oct-20-2015,Kyy Games,Role-Playing | General,Gaming Nexus,85,While it might not be the most complex role-playing game available its a worthwhile and entertaining purchase for players eager to set out on a casual fantasy adventure.

Darius Cozmic Collection: Console,PlayStation 4,Jun-16-2020,M2,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Impulsegamer,72,Overall if you are a fan of retro gaming especially if you were a fan of Darius then this may well be just the right fix you have been looking for. In terms of buying the collection… that may be a bit trickier as you can choose either Arcade or Console… not both… well you can choose both but you will be buying two separate collections rather than one. So I would suggest if you had a preference or if you have experience I should say with one over the other… go with what you know. Or if you are feeling like throwing money around then by all means get both. A worth while trip down memory lane!
Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment,PlayStation Vita,Aug-19-2014,Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Gaming Nexus,88,Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment transcends its license to become a truly engrossing portable role-playing game. Unfortunately this lengthy adventure is far from perfect with problems ranging from bad translation to simplistic missions. But none of that gets in the way of one of the most ambitious anime games ever constructed.
Star Fox: Assault,GameCube,Feb-14-2005,Namco,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Thunderbolt,90,While certainly not perfect – the game is short and could have benefited greatly from LAN or online multiplayer support – there really isnt a more versatile arcade-style shooter for the GameCube system.
Shoot Many Robots,Xbox 360,Mar-14-2012,Demiurge Studios,Action | General | General,ZTGD,94,Of course if you do find a level to be too challenging you can always jump online with some fellow rednecks and have a blast cooperatively. If youre looking for a fun little shooter that is not only enjoyable alone but also with some friends you really need to check out Shoot Many Robots.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: 3 Dimensions of Murder,PC,Mar-14-2006,Telltale Games,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,IGN,86,Fascinating stories great twists good graphics superior voice acting decent gameplay and the desire to now become a CSI once again is what we are left with. And that is good enough.
Lost Planet: Extreme Condition,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),80,Delivers plenty of stunning-looking innovative gameplay to outshine its weaknesses especially considering the very attractive $39.95 price. [Mar 2008 p.86]
JYDGE,Switch,Oct-19-2017,10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Vooks,100,I love the look of Jydge. It’s like The Sims and Blade Runner got together one night and decided it would be a good idea to combine their aesthetics into a joint venture of top-down/isometric and bleak futuristic stylings and then spiced it up with pops of neon. The soundtrack is pretty good too. You could say it’s like a box of chocolates; you never know what you are going to get until that one track kicks in that is as annoying as coming across a chocolate with a concealed almond inside. Not to worry there are plenty of chocolates in the box and they are random any time you enter a stage. The music tracks that is not the chocolates.
Silent Hill 4: The Room,PC,Sep-7-2004,Konami,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Stuff,85,The large number of cut scenes seems a little distracting at first but once you get used to them they add a lot of depth to the game.
UFO: Aftermath,PC,Oct-15-2003,Altar Interactive,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GameZone,85,An interesting mix of RTS turn-based and straight strategic gameplay and varied mission designs. However the turn-based/RTS system may seem a bit convoluted for some gamers who expect a more simplistic action-oriented approach to squad-based strategy.
K-1 World Grand Prix,PlayStation 2,Jul-9-2003,Konami,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Cheat Code Central,90,Its not a button masher. Energy and strength must be conserved. The key to good gameplay is looking for and finding openings. Taking advantage of your opponents weakness is the strategy that will separate the men from the boys.
Incoming Forces,PC,Sep-25-2002,Rage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,ActionTrip,84,The gameplay is intense and the visuals are impressive which means that all the shooter basics are in place.
Guilty Gear X Advance Edition,Game Boy Advance,Aug-29-2002,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameZone,80,With a little more time greater character selection and making the game a little harder Capcom will have a serious contender on their hands.
Army Men: RTS,PC,Mar-24-2002,Pandemic Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Media and Games Online Network,80,It is extremely funny in some places and you won’t be able to stop laughing it would be a good item for anyone that enjoys a good laugh or use to play with the little soldiers when they where a kid.
Blood Omen 2,PlayStation 2,Mar-21-2002,Crystal Dynamics,Action Adventure | Horror,GamePro,80,Kain’s modus operandi of grim human slaughter is so distressingly delightful.
MotoGP,Game Boy Advance,Mar-8-2002,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Street,Cinescape,83,Probably the best racing game on the Game Boy Advance. It has great graphics good control and is a lot of fun to play. The password system is the only real problem I’ve found.
Iron Aces,Dreamcast,Feb-6-2001,Marionette,Simulation | Flight | WWII,Playboy,85,Basic gameplay mechanics combine with real-world charisma to form the most solid Dreamcast flight simulator seen to date.
Shattered Union,PC,Oct-17-2005,PopTop Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | General | Historic,Gamezilla!,90,So overall its a buy except possibly for those who might find the apparent wishful-thinking anti-Americanism of the setting disturbing (It depicts Washington DC as a post-nuke grease spot with a ruin of the Washington Monument in the middle.)
MediEvil,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2019,Other Ocean Interactive | Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action Adventure | General,App Trigger,100,MediEvil is a colorful trip down memory lane filled with gorgeous updated graphics the same amazing OST and improved (yet still retro) gameplay mechanics. This will make you feel like a kid again.
Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Her Interactive,Adventure | First-Person | General | Point-and-Click | Modern,IGN,75,Another engaging Nancy Drew mystery full of colorful characters. Along the way it provides a wide range of game play activities and keeps things interesting with some of the most creative puzzles Ive seen in an adventure game.
Pony Friends,DS,May-30-2007,Tantalus,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Digital Entertainment News,78,If you have a little girl (or perhaps a somewhat effeminate little boy) that loves ponies you really can’t go wrong with Pony Friends. While it’s not quite as polished and ambitious as Nintendogs was it’s still surprisingly good and head and shoulders above most other virtual pet games.
The Escapists: Complete Edition,Switch,Sep-25-2018,Mouldy Toof Studios,Action | General,COGconnected,82,Filled with humor cuddly visuals and some surprising depth The Escapists: Complete Edition is a big game in a tiny little package. You might feel like a real prisoner at times trying to survive its grueling difficulty but its charm and reasonable price help to make this stint in the big-house a surprisingly fun experience.
Monster Monpiece,PlayStation Vita,May-27-2014,Compile Heart,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle,Digitally Downloaded,90,Managing your deck is nearly as exciting as the battles in its own way. Nabbing new booster packs and busting them open with the touch screen is a simple joy that offers a little joyful suspense every time you acquire new cards.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD,PlayStation 3,Aug-28-2012,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skating | Skating | Skate / Skateboard,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),80,But even with a limited breadth of content Tony Hawk HD manages to dish out more nostalgic fun for $15 than our last few retail purchases combined. [Oct 2012 p.83]
Zombie Apocalypse: Never Die Alone,PlayStation 3,Oct-25-2011,Konami,Action | General | Shooter | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,IGN,75,The interesting skill-based challenges and snappy funny writing give Never Die Alone surprising legs the flop first game wrongfully assumed it had.
NCAA March Madness 08,PlayStation 3,Dec-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,PSX Extreme,81,All in all NCAA March Madness 08 is not a bad game its just yet another bad PS3 port.
Nin2-Jump,Xbox 360,Apr-27-2011,Cave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,GamePro,90,For $5 you get a great-looking game as finely-tuned as any of Caves other arcade-style games making it more than the sum of its parts. Anyone into platforming action should give Nin2-Jump a go.
Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water,Wii U,Oct-22-2015,Koei Tecmo Games,Action | General | Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,NF Magazine,90,After the attention-grabbing opening the greatness of the story never lets up for a moment. [Issue #18 – November/December 2015 p.22]
LEGRAND LEGACY: Tale of the Fatebounds,PC,Jan-24-2018,SEMISOFT,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,GameSpace,80,Legrand Legacy is a great indie JRPG that brings a lot of cool ideas to the genre. While it has its quirks and definitely bad controls with the keyboard the gorgeous visuals and gameplay make up for it tenfold.
King's Quest Chapter 2: Rubble Without a Cause,PC,Dec-15-2015,The Odd Gentlemen,Adventure | General,GamingTrend,75,While Rubble Without a Cause can be a little obtuse and less intuitive than A Knight to Remember it is still a worthy installment.
The Fancy Pants Adventures,Xbox 360,Apr-20-2011,Over the Top Games | EA 2D,Shooter | Scrolling | Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gaming Nexus,83,For someone who has never had the best relationship in the world with old-school 2D platformers The Fancy Pants Adventures acquaints it itself quite well. Exceptionally strong art design level design and music more than make up for the fact that sometimes no matter what you do Fancy Pants Mans momentum is going to kill you. However with all the secret areas and collectibles smartly hidden in each level theres bound to be something new to do when you try again.
The Legend of Legacy,3DS,Oct-13-2015,Cattle Call | FuRyu,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,100,Thank goodness The Legend of Legacy is on a portable system because once you start you’ll find time anywhere to play: you’ll get in a few more rounds of grinding on the bus or a few steps closer to your self-imposed goal while waiting in line in a government office. The classic JRPG elements combined with the characters the story the graphics and the music make this a game not to miss out on.
Super Bomberman R,PlayStation 4,Jun-12-2018,Konami,Puzzle | Action | Arcade,Video Chums,82,If you dont own a Switch and enjoy Bomberman then Super Bomberman R Shiny Edition is certainly worth picking up. Even though it doesnt improve everything from the original release theres so much content here that youre bound to have a blast.
Lichtspeer,PlayStation 4,Sep-27-2016,Lichthund,Action Adventure | General,ZTGD,80,Lichtspeer is a fun distraction from the current avalanche of triple-A fall titles; one that you will be able to dip in and out of as you please thanks to its simplistic gameplay and control mechanics. Never demanding a huge investment from the player but rewarding them if they put the time in.
Citizens of Earth,Wii U,Jan-20-2015,Eden Industries,General | Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,ZTGD,90,If you’re looking for a title with both style and substance and a hint of nostalgia Citizens of Earth is your next RPG purchase.
Metal Slug XX,PSP,Feb-23-2010,SNK Playmore,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,Worth Playing,80,As far as the franchise goes Metal Slug XX is pretty accessible and most action-oriented gamers will enjoy it.
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Classic Trilogy HD,PlayStation 3,Sep-27-2011,Ubisoft,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Digital Chumps,86,The original Splinter Cell games are classic and its nice to see Ubisoft give them the HD treatment. While not as complete as I was hoping for this Trilogy is still a great addition addition to your collection.
Brut@l,PlayStation 4,Aug-9-2016,Stormcloud Games Limited,Action Adventure | General,GameGrin,85,I really liked Brut@l. It has vivid graphics good depth a strong solo mode with its presentation of dungeons and the enemies and this was topped off with a really intuitive Dungeon Creator. There is plenty on offer here and it certainly doesn’t restrict itself to fans of the genre.
Oil Rush,PC,Sep-23-2011,Unigine Corp | Russia,Strategy | Real-Time | Modern | General | Modern,CD-Action,85,The only real flaw I can point out is optimization – Oil Rush slows down randomly once in a while. It does not impair its great playability though. [March 2012 p.46]
Golazo!,Switch,Sep-12-2019,Purple Tree Studio,Sports | Team | Soccer | Arcade,NintendoWorldReport,75,Golazo does a lot right even in spite of a few nagging issues with shooting and passing. I sincerely enjoy the presentation as it has a wacky yet still grounded feel. The single-player offerings aren’t all that deep but in a multiplayer setting this is an enjoyable sports game. It’s light and breezy with just enough strategy that it could rouse amusing competition out of a local multiplayer session.
Atari Flashback Classics,Switch,Dec-13-2018,AtGames,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Video Chums,85,Atari Flashback Classics for Switch is one of the biggest and best classic game compilations ever produced. Not only are there a ton of enjoyable games for any kind of gamer everything is implemented spot-on for big screen or on-the-go retro fun.
Yo-kai Watch Blasters: Red Cat Corps,3DS,Sep-7-2018,Level 5,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,90,Overall the game is fantastic. It’s fun for solo play and is even better when working in co-op. I’ve poured hours into the game and have still not completed every possible task available. There’s so much replayability and it’ll have you craving for more Yo-kai madness… or maybe a Yo-kai is making you think that. Regardless the game is definitely fantastic and I’d highly recommend adding it to your 3DS’s library.
Gravel,Xbox One,Feb-27-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Game Over Online,80,Overall Gravel is Milestone’s finest game to date. It combines a surprisingly high amount of racing types together and does an exceptional job with all of them. The handling is far better than most of their prior work and the level of on-screen excitement is at its highest point yet as well. There are some rough edges when it comes to the overall presentation and the FMV-laden story mode of sorts is somewhat of a groaner but it doesn’t take away from how fun the core racing action is. It uses rumble better than most games on the market today as well – at least for Xbox One controller users and is a solid pickup for anyone craving some off-road racing.
Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls,PlayStation 4,Jun-27-2017,Spike Chunsoft,Action Adventure | General,Digitally Downloaded,80,As with the main Danganronpa games there’s a number of serious subtexts to Ultra Despair Girls and actually digging into these themes makes it clear that the game’s a lot smarter than it might appear at first.
Vikings: Wolves of Midgard,PlayStation 4,Mar-28-2017,Games Farm,Role-Playing | Action RPG,COGconnected,80,It didn’t take long for Vikings to bludgeon those expectations into a meaty undulating pulp.
FORCED SHOWDOWN,PC,Mar-29-2016,BetaDwarf,Role-Playing | Action RPG,COGconnected,85,I think Forced Showdown has done a great job of incorporating different strategic layers on top of a twin stick shooter.
Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus,PlayStation Vita,Oct-14-2014,Tamsoft | Marvelous AQL,Action | General,The Vita Lounge,88,With a great combat system tons of customization options some great characters and a few hundred missions to go through Shinovi Versus is a must have for anyone who enjoys great combat - as long as theyre not overly sensitive to fanservice or sex jokes.
Rayman Raving Rabbids 2,Wii,Nov-15-2007,Ubisoft Montpellier,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,AceGamez,90,If you have more than one friend or family member to play Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 with then there are few excuses not to own it.
Ice Age 2: The Meltdown,GameCube,Mar-14-2006,Vivendi Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN,79,The game delivers a fairly conventional adventure packed full of collect-a-thons and tried-and-true been-here-and-done-that challenges. But it does them well. Control is tight levels varied and there are some genuinely funny moments.
Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir,PlayStation 2,Jul-12-2005,Racjin,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Game Chronicles,84,Extremely fun to play with fast-paced fights and a great combo system that puts the first game to shame. This latest installment is a huge step in the right direction for the series.
Tomb Raider: Legend,PSP,Jun-21-2006,Buzz Monkey,Action Adventure | Modern | Modern | Linear,Game Informer,83,But if you like to game on the go Tomb Raider Legend is a solid little addition to the PSP library and an adventure that is worth experiencing on any console. [July 2006 p.113]
Lollipop Chainsaw,PlayStation 3,Jun-12-2012,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | General | General,Digital Chumps,86,Amidst an important layer of absurdity brought to you by the likes of Suda51 James Gunn and Jimmy Urine Lollipop Chainsaw has a lot in common with the delightful 8-bit games of my youth.
Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games,Wii,Nov-6-2007,Sega | Nintendo | Sega Sports R&D,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,90,Its ideal both as a family game or as great post-pub entertainment. [Christmas 2007 p.64]
Warhammer 40000: Mechanicus,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2020,Bulwark Studios,Action | General,GameCritics,90,Warhammer 40000: Mechanicus is a clear win for fans of tactics and 40K alike. The gameplay is rich detailed and nuanced and the concept aesthetics and style are some of the best uses of the Warhammer license to date. No matter which way it’s sliced by a sharp articulated tentacle this one’s a winner.
Crystar,PlayStation 4,Aug-27-2019,FuRyu,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,100,I always have been whether its the writings on T.S. Eliot and Poe films from The Cabinet of Dr Caligari through to Blade Runner the music of Nick Cave or games like I Am Setsuna and now Crystar. That Crystar manages to be so layered and nuanced with that theme makes it all the more impressive. FuRyu continues to be the publisher to watch for anyone who likes their games with a bit of genuine artistic credibility.
InnerSpace,PlayStation 4,Jan-16-2018,PolyKnight Games,Simulation | Flight | Civilian,PlayStation LifeStyle,90,InnerSpace is a game that you should be playing. The well-realized worlds exceptional aesthetic and compelling exploration mechanics complement each other tremendously well. If you can get past the occasional bout of unnecessary complex exposition the evolution of each environment tells a compelling enough story to keep you enthralled from start to finish. Drop everything and check out what deserves to be one of the sleeper hits of 2018.
The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer,GameCube,Nov-1-2005,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,AceGamez,80,Worth a purchase for sure. Obviously younger audiences are going to enjoy the game more than older players but for any self-respecting Incredibles fan the story and the teamwork gameplay is enough to warrant a look.
The King's Bird,Switch,Feb-12-2019,Serenity Forge,Action | Platformer | 2D,Video Chums,80,Hardcore platformer fans will love the challenges that The Kings Bird presents while less skilled gamers can still appreciate the gorgeous game world via the incredibly helpful Assist Mode. Talk about going above and beyond!
Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds,PlayStation Vita,Aug-12-2014,Division2,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Nexus,80,As lovable as ever Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds is right at home on Sonys portable. It feels as though this is where the game belonged all along. Everything has carried over: the old school beat-em-up charm along with a heavy dose of gameplay variation and customization but the added portability makes it even better than before.
Dragon Age: Origins - Leliana's Song,PlayStation 3,Jul-6-2010,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,Gamer 2.0,75,Lelianas Song is an admirable addition to the Dragon Age: Origins storyline but with only three hours of content there really is nothing here to write home about. Fans of the game that are looking to gain some back-story on one of the games main characters should definitely check it out as it offers insight to some of the dialogue and story segments mentioned during Origins.
Shark Tale,Xbox,Sep-27-2004,Edge of Reality,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamingTrend,87,Shark Tale isn’t aimed at me. That said I’m having a ball playing it with my wife. The game is squarely aimed at those who loved the recently-released movie but there is enough nostalgia there for the whole family to enjoy.
The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring,PC,Nov-4-2003,Liquid Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Over Online,83,Being one of the first strategy titles based on Tolkiens locus classicus War of the Ring should introduce a good many movie fans to the strategy genre -- and most likely no greater percentage of Ring fans exists than amongst the gaming demographic -- but veteran real-time strategy players might want to look elsewhere if depth is what theyre seeking.
Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo,PlayStation 2,Oct-7-2003,Frontier Developments,Action | Platformer | 3D,Total Video Games,80,Its fun to play but more importantly captures the Wallace & Gromit spirit perfectly.
Naval Ops: Warship Gunner,PlayStation 2,Jun-25-2003,Micro Cabin,Simulation | Ship,PSM Magazine,80,Its an arcade game at its heart and its a whole lot of fun. [Aug 2003 p.32]
Star Wars Bounty Hunter,GameCube,Dec-7-2002,LucasArts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GameZone,90,While the game is a bit on the linear side it does a fantastic job of telling an interesting original story.
Dungeon Hunter: Alliance,PlayStation 3,Apr-12-2011,Gameloft,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Gaming Age,83,I like the dungeon crawling. I like the character customization. I like the loot. But most of all I like the multiplayer. With four players going at it the battles become pandemonium and I love it. Dungeon Hunter: Alliance has everything I look for in a downloadable title.
Teenage Zombies: Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingys,DS,Apr-15-2008,InLight Entertainment,Adventure | General | General,Hardcore Gamer,85,Teenage Zombies is pretty much the perfect platformer. [Spring 2008 p.52]
Fret Nice,PlayStation 3,Feb-4-2010,Tecmo | Pieces Interactive,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Gaming Age,83,Its a unique little platformer thats pretty much perfect for the service and while its ideal control scheme might have a few flaws to it the overall enjoyment I gained from playing it definitely outweighed the bad.
Just Cause,PlayStation 2,Sep-27-2006,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,Times Online,100,Fans of the Nintendo SNES classic Pilotwings will literally jump at the chance to parachute from any of the aircraft for spectacular views of the vast landscape below. There is bound to be a sequel because this original is so good.
Nelke & the Legendary Alchemists: Ateliers of the New World,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Gust,Role-Playing | General,GameCritics,85,The perfect melding of two genres Nelke and the Legendary Alchemists: Ateliers of the New World succeeds by taking the best elements of both and cutting all the fat. It’s an experience casual enough on both the management and RPG fronts that it’s the perfect game to introduce newcomers to the series. Most importantly Nelke is in touch with the series’ heart — at every turn this is a story about how anything can be accomplished if people are willing to work together and as saccharine as that may sound the heroine is so guilelessly positive that it works.
Katana Kami: A Way of the Samurai Story,PlayStation 4,Feb-20-2020,Acquire,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Action RPG | Linear,Digitally Downloaded,90,While I probably enjoy Katana Kami more as a cultural work than a game such as it is that’s so much more important to me anyway.
How to Survive 2,PlayStation 4,Feb-6-2017,505 Games,Action Adventure | Survival,God is a Geek,80,How to Survive 2 is a much improved sequel featuring some beautifully looking environments. There are plenty of upgrades for you and your haul and you’ll lose yourself in the menus if you’re not careful. The music is wonderful at times and it makes tense moments even worse even if it does remind you of the opening theme song of The Walking Dead. Whether you’re playing with friends strangers or on your own How to Survive 2 offers an authentic survival experience that has plenty of replayability.
White Night,PlayStation 4,Mar-3-2015,OSome Studio,Action Adventure | Survival,Hobby Consolas,80,A very special horror game that will leave something inside you after you play it. The attractive visuals intelligent use of light and morbid story behind it are its greatest assets.
Sniper Elite V2,Xbox 360,May-2-2012,Rebellion,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Game Informer,83,I went into Sniper Elite V2 with one desire: Disfigure Nazis from hundreds of meters away. The game delivers on this core mechanic beautifully. While I would have preferred enemies with less superhuman vision and better stealth options at the end of the game I couldnt recall a scenario I didnt enjoy. Sniper Elite V2 is a must for anyone interested in a smart shooter with an emphasis on gore.
We Happy Few,PlayStation 4,Aug-10-2018,Compulsion Games,Action Adventure | General,Cubed3,90,Whether interest lies in the survival horror genre or the first-person action adventure this is a title that delivers an amazing and heart-pounding 25+ hours. Its also noteworthy that a sandbox mode is coming to the game but as of release it is not an available option. Hopefully that means a lot of content post release.
The Spectrum Retreat,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Dan Smith Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,PSX-Sense.nl,85,A story-based puzzle game which excels mainly in the latter. Puzzles quickly become challenging and that makes for a fun experience due in large part to great audiovisuals. The image sometimes stutters while turning the puzzle but apart from this minor issue this game is plenty of fun.
Disney Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse,Xbox 360,Sep-4-2013,Sega,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Games Master UK,85,Superb remake that recaptures the originals magic while adding new twists to classic ideas. [Nov 2013 p.70]
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PlayStation 2,Nov-8-2005,Point of View,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,Worth Playing,87,In a sea of look-alike poker game clones WCP2 stands out as the one that feels most like playing an actual game of poker against actual people for better or worse.
Rise of the Triad,PC,Jul-31-2013,Interceptor,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,PC PowerPlay,90,This is the first-person shooter distilled a tribute to PC gamings glorious days of yore. You need to play it. [Sept 2013 p.88]
Another Sight,PC,Sep-6-2018,Lunar Great Wall Studios,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,The Games Machine,87,Another Sight deals with a difficult subject such as blindness through a skillful realization various mechanics beautiful graphics and an evocative soundtrack. Highly recommended.
Assault Suit Leynos,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2016,Dracue,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,Hardcore Gamer,80,Assault Suit Leynos is exactly what a remake should be. It takes everything that worked about the original and improves upon it with modern flourishes.
Train Fever,PC,Sep-4-2014,Urban Games,Simulation | Vehicle | Train,GameStar,82,Extremely addictive despite some weaknesses. A captivating world of model railroads.
Alien Shooter: Vengeance,PC,Feb-16-2007,Sigma Team,Action | General | General,AceGamez,90,As a no-frills action RPG this game knows what it is and does what it does exceptionally well in all areas - and I for one couldnt be any more ecstatic over how it turned out.
Fallout 4: Automatron,PC,Mar-22-2016,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,GameCrate,78,All in all Automatron is a good bite of DLC not a huge sandwich like were used to seeing from Bethesda and not out of the norm for the current DLC market. But like a lot of good bites it leaves us wanting more.
Penumbra: Requiem,PC,Aug-27-2008,Frictional Games,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamerNode,80,A sort of mixed-breed game thats fun but ultimately less captivating than its predecessor. For $10 by itself or $20 bundled with Black Plague its still worth picking up.
SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs,PlayStation 3,Apr-19-2011,Zipper Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,91,Ive played less than ten games on my PS3 and reviewed only three and Im proud to count SOCOM 4 as one of those games. Playing this game solo brought back memories of Full Spectrum Warrior with all the squad-based tactics and ordering options and playing co-op was like reliving all my best Tom Clancy moments and the online versus modes had all the fun of MAG with the added bonus of the incredible Bomb Squad mode. And while it may never be able to compete with Call of Duty in sheer popularity SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs definitely wins when it comes to reality.
Space Ark,Xbox 360,Jun-16-2010,Strawdog Studios,Action | General | General,DarkZero,80,Space Ark is a charming hybrid of a handful of classic arcade games. Its combination of score-beating arcade mentality and devious puzzle elements in the later stages make it shine against the murky backdrop of lesser XBLA titles.
WRC: FIA World Rally Championship,PSP,Apr-18-2006,Traveller's Tales,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Boomtown,90,The real meat and potatoes of the game lies in the championship mode. Hardcore fans of the sport will be delighted to know that it is an exact reproduction of the real life version.
Deception IV: Blood Ties,PlayStation Vita,Mar-25-2014,Koei Tecmo Games,Action Adventure | Modern | Strategy | General,Gaming Age,83,Is it repetitive? Sure if you dont get a perverse thrill out of launching people through the air and into the path of an oncoming boulder. But if you do — and boy do I ever — then Deception IV should be right up your alley.
NIER,Xbox 360,Apr-27-2010,Cavia Inc.,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GamingTrend,90,Its a game I adored without really being able to put my finger on why and even with the heavy-hitter AAA titles that have come out this year Id say Nier is simply one of the most enjoyable and unique gaming experiences of 2010.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China,PC,Apr-21-2015,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action Adventure | General | Linear,PC Gamer,83,A stripped down stealth offering that reinvigorates Assassins Creed by putting attention back on the sneaky stuff.
The UnderGarden,PC,Nov-10-2010,Vitamin G Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,GamingTrend,83,A higher level of difficulty and a lengthier campaign might have elevated The UnderGardens score but as it stands its still a terrific title that straddles the Zen and puzzle genres with style.
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts,Xbox One,Nov-22-2019,CI Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Jeuxvideo.com,75,With Contracts the Sniper Ghost Warrior series finally gets on the right track by focusing on the level design of closed environnements and featuring strategic gameplay.

Steel Rats,PlayStation 4,Nov-7-2018,Tate Multimedia,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,GamingTrend,85,Steel Rats is an awesome 2.5D platformer that makes great use of motorcycle based combat. The team of four bikers are badass and unique prompting you to try them all out and being able to switch between them on the fly keeps gameplay fresh.
My Memory of Us,PlayStation 4,Oct-9-2018,Juggler Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,PlayStation Universe,80,Where the game really exceeds is the beautiful and haunting retelling of the Holocaust as a robot invasion through the eyes of two children that won’t let their friendship be torn apart by hate and prejudice.
TurnOn,PC,Jun-1-2016,Brainy Studio LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,GamingTrend,85,TurnOn is an enjoyable and heartwarming little game. With electrical wires instead of platforms it offers gameplay that feels fresh piquing your interest at every turn with whatever new adventure or obstacle you’ll face next.

Xotic,PC,Sep-16-2011,WXP,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Fantasy | Arcade,BigPond GameArena,80,Great for those moments when you have time to spare and you can outdo your previous performance. For most it will be just that - a great game to play for a bit but not particularly addictive. In some however it will inspire marathon gaming sessions into the early hours of the morning bettering your scores and those of others.
Fantasy Wars,PC,Nov-8-2007,Ino-Co,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Tactics,Pelit (Finland),88,A true blast from the past turn based fantasy strategy in the spirit of old classics from 90s. A bold move that succeeds. Commanding your own orc horde or mercenary army to victory through the linear campaign is simply fun especially when the game mechanics have nothing to be ashamed of and there’s plenty of complexity to keep you thinking. We need more of unhurried turn based goodness like this in the future. [Nov 2007]
Criminal Girls 2: Party Favors,PlayStation Vita,Sep-22-2016,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,While I don’t think Criminal Girls 2 goes anywhere near far enough to be the extreme Sadean experience that it clearly wants to be at least we have a game that achieves something down that path. Art needs extreme experiences and genuinely extreme experiences (aside from those laden with gore) are rare indeed in this industry. Kudos to NISA for not only taking a chance on the first Criminal Girls but backing up its faith that people do appreciate this kind of experience by localising the second too.
Do Not Fall,PlayStation 3,Jul-23-2013,Xpec | XPEC Entertainment Inc.,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,DarkStation,80,Do Not Fall was a bit of a pleasant surprise offering some nice challenge with an interesting mechanic.
Digimon World: Dusk,DS,Sep-18-2007,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General | Trainer,RPG Fan,75,Give this one a chance especially if youre into this unique brand of games. If you were surprised by the quality of the new Pokémon games or if youre a long-time Digimon fan this might be a game worth playing.
The Punisher,PC,Jan-18-2005,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Maxim Online,100,Its not all brutality. The Punisher is also one of the most immersive strategy games ever created. Aim for the head and enjoy.

Wreckateer,Xbox 360,Jul-25-2012,Iron Galaxy Studios,Action | General | General,Destructoid,90,While the storyline may be a bit hokey and the voice-acting a bit childish the fun that can be had with the gameplay and smooth easy motion controls just cant be denied. Its the best kind of fun: simple to play but hard to master. Its a casual motion controlled game that actually works well and offers up real satisfaction when that control pays off it high scores and massive destruction.
King's Quest Chapter 4: Snow Place Like Home,PlayStation 4,Sep-27-2016,The Odd Gentlemen,Adventure | General,Vandal,88,We loved this episode. It shows a sensible evolution being more mature and rising its difficulty. If you havent played this series yet its time to start.
Beat Sketcher,PlayStation 3,Nov-23-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Music | Dancing,Play UK,85,Its not only a fun game but shows off the Move brilliantly. [Issue#201 p.99]
Panzer Tactics DS,DS,Nov-6-2007,Sproing Interactive Media | Sproing,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | Historic | Tactics,Cheat Code Central,80,Panzer Tactics offer a great turn-based military combat alternative to the popular Advance Wars series. Its light years from having Dual Strike beat but some players will surely appreciate - and perhaps even prefer - the more serious tone and realism of the historical battles in Panzer Tactics.
Rocky: Legends,Xbox,Sep-28-2004,Venom Games,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Next Level Gaming,84,It has the great gameplay from the original a new story more and still looks great. But yanking out the big online feature that made me jump for joy I cant give the game the same score.
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon,Game Boy Advance,Jun-29-2004,Capcom,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GMR Magazine,80,If theres one complaint its the visuals. Theyre not bad just more or less the same visuals weve seen since part one. [Aug 2004 p.89]
Go! Go! Hypergrind,GameCube,Nov-18-2003,Poponchi,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Nintendophiles,88,By taking a lighthearted and cartoony approach to a genre of games that was previously untouched by such antics Poponchi succeeds in providing an altogether refreshing gameplay experience for those who are tired of the traditional elements of skateboarding games.
Mystic Heroes,GameCube,Sep-30-2002,Koei,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Play Magazine,80,A game with gorgeous models intense combos magic-driven action and a cast of characters that make character selection a really tough decision. [Oct 2002 p.84]

The Operative: No One Lives Forever,PlayStation 2,Apr-16-2002,Monolith Productions,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,GamePro,80,This is one solidly constructed action game that doesnt take itself too seriously. Its called camp man. Check it out. [Mar 2002 p.98]

WWE 2K18,Xbox One,Oct-13-2017,Yuke's,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,Generación Xbox,88,WWE 2K18 is the best wrestling game so far. A great variety of wrestlers with a new technical section that finally meets this generations standards. A great game where youll always have something to do and wrestling fans will enjoy it as will kids.
Assassin's Creed II: Bonfire of the Vanities,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2010,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Pelit (Finland),81,Bonfire of the Vanities completes Ezio’s memories and is at least for now the last DLC pack for Assassin’s Creed II. This time around Ezio is tasked with the assassination (surprise surprise) of Girolamo Savonarola and his men. Removing Savonarola’s underlings is quite rewarding after Forli’s Cakewalk and you get to admire the full extent of Florence yet Bonfire of the Vanities offers nothing new. The adventure is worth its price tag particularly if you buy the Secret Locations along with it but nothing to exult about. [Apr 2010]
Underground,Wii U,Apr-2-2015,Grendel Games,Action | General,NintendoWorldReport,80,After you learn the controls this is a puzzle game worth spending some serious time with on your Wii U.

MTX Mototrax,PSP,Jun-28-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Motorcycle | Other | Motocross | Motocross,Game Chronicles,80,A challenging racing game that helps fill a void in the niche-genre of dirt bike racing.
Cities: Skylines - Nintendo Switch Edition,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Tantalus,Strategy | Management | Government,Multiplayer.it,82,Cities: Skylines is still a great game on Nintendo Switch but its a version inevitably flawed by technical limits and intricate interface.
Nights of Azure,PlayStation 4,Mar-29-2016,Gust,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,100,Nights of Azure is such a progressive artful and rich experience that much like other masterpieces such as Nier of Pandora’s Tower is so incredibly special as much for its flaws and individuality as what it does well.
Hyperballoid HD,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2010,iSquared Games,Action | General | General,Armchair Empire,80,Costing only $5 bucks PS3 gamers that enjoy old-school arcade-style gaming won’t find a much better value than the next-generation brick-breaker Hyperballoid HD.
Worms Revolution Extreme,PlayStation Vita,Oct-8-2013,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,God is a Geek,80,Crucially it also offers great value with a ton to see and do and some well-worked cross platform opportunities.

Planet Monsters,Game Boy Advance,Dec-6-2001,Planet Interactive,Action | General,Gaming Maxx,86,The lastability isnt extraordinary but it is decent.
Close Combat: First to Fight,PC,Apr-18-2005,Destineer,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,Gaming Horizon,84,You are actually able to feel what it’s like to be a Marine overseas and because the game is based on the actual training tool that was developed for our soldiers you get to have an inside look at how they operate in hostile environments.
KickBeat,PlayStation Vita,Sep-3-2013,Zen Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GamingTrend,84,I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how well it turned out. For only $10 you’ll get plenty of gameplay for the money spent.

Below,PC,Dec-14-2018,Capy Games,Action | General,GameStar,85,Nobody had expected Below in 2018 anymoe - and even more unexpectedly the low-poly Roguelike is one of the hits of the year.
SpinTires,PC,Jun-12-2014,Oovee Game Studios,Driving | Rally / Offroad | Simulation | Racing | Vehicle | Automobile | Civilian,Quarter to Three,100,It’s not survival horror with trucks. It’s survival horror for trucks. You as a driver as a person as a foot on a gas pedal and a pair of hands don’t exist. Whether it’s because Oovee didn’t want to fuss with character models or because it’s an intentional effort to focus on the element of machines vs nature without mere humanity in the middle to muck it all up the world of Spintires is like Maximum Overdrive that dopey horror movie where trucks come alive and drive themselves around. Not for the cheese factor of course.
Assassin's Creed III - The Betrayal,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Ubisoft Quebec,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,AusGamers,83,The first episode touched on it but this one really hammers the idea home and despite the bad taste buying three separate episodes for the same DLC may leave in some people’s mouths this episode works well.
Radical Rabbit Stew,PlayStation 4,Jul-16-2020,Pugstorm,Action | Arcade,God is a Geek,80,Radical Rabbit Stew is afun 16-bit puzzler with an amusing story. While its short sitting at the 2-3 hour mark to complete its a good way to spend an afternoon. Different cute and quirky.
Namco Museum Archives Vol. 2,Switch,Jun-18-2020,B.B.Studio,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Worth Playing,80,Compared to the first volume Namco Museum Archives Volume 2 feels like a better package of games all around. While there are still a large number of arcade-to-NES ports here the genre variety is much broader and fewer games have made appearances on previous compilations. There are still a few clunkers here but most of the titles are solid and while nothing is as sought-after as Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti was theres still a good collection here. For the retro fans this is worth checking out for $19.99.
Stela,PC,Mar-13-2020,SkyBox Labs,Action | Platformer | 2D,PC Invasion,90,Stela is a nice break from the hectic shooters and other competitive style games. It opts for impeccable sounds and visual design in order to convey emotion throughout the three-hour playtime. But dont let the overall length steer you away from something thats more akin to a short story than a full AAA produced title. Its a worthy experience from start to finish providing the right escape for those without a lot of free time on their hands.
The Council,PC,Mar-13-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,The Indie Game Website,90,The Council is a fantastic example of what adventure games are capable of with tons of content choices and characters you won’t soon forget. If you’re looking for something to fill the void that Telltale Games’ departure from the industry is leaving behind The Council is a worthy contender – so long as you’re ready to deal with everything that comes with it.

Telltale Games is on a roll this season and The Enemy Within continues to be some of the developer’s best work.
How We Soar,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Penny Black Studios,Action | General,Push Square,80,Some minor iffy moments aside How We Soar is a beautifully relaxing game with tight presentation and some sound controls. A lovely concept thats really well executed this is another wonderful example of why virtual reality gaming represents the way forward and you should certainly check it out if you havent done so already.
Scratches,PC,Mar-8-2006,Nucleosys,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Just Adventure,100,They have really pulled out all the stops with their first effort and created one classic piece of Adventure gaming. Just don’t get too used to that luxury called sleep.
Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge,PlayStation 3,Apr-2-2013,Team Ninja,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Digital Chumps,84,Razors Edge mixes up tradition in the Ninja Gaiden franchise enough to make it a worthy purchase. A great story (even with action cliches) gameplay improvements more dismemberments and online modes. Problems with the camera glitches and invisible walls still plague the series. At $40 there is plenty of value to consider this worthwhile.
PaRappa the Rapper,PSP,Jul-17-2007,Epics,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Play UK,88,Retains all the charm it had ten years ago. [Issue#155 p.84]
DreamWorks Voltron VR Chronicles,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Digital Domain,Action | General,GamingTrend,80,It would have been very easy for Digital Domain to make a low-effort Voltron knockoff but instead Voltron VR Chronicles feels like a small slice of the show brought to life. While it is a little short and the interactivity is somewhat basic if you are a fan this game is a must have. Next time just let us form Voltron and give us sword and shield VR controls to take out the next episode’s Robeast!
Still Life 2,PC,Aug-11-2009,GameCo,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,91,Still Life 2 despite its many faults draws you in puts you through the ringer and then spits you out like a wad of used gum at the end. I cant say its a great game -- too flawed and at times annoying for that -- but it does deliver the goods.
Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches,PC,Oct-5-2008,Arberth Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,IGN,75,In spite of a few missteps Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches is a good-looking entertaining and well-made game especially considering the size of the dev team. Its the perfect title for people who dig history mystery and the paranormal not to mention people who like to think when they game.
Shadowrun,PC,May-29-2007,FASA Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,NTSC-uk,90,Underneath the hood is a well-honed constantly surprising beast and one that isn’t purely for FPS fans thanks to a generous degree of auto-aim that places much of the emphasis on tactics and intelligent usage of the tools at your disposal.
Sniper Elite III,PlayStation 4,Jul-1-2014,Rebellion,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic,IGN,82,Sniper Elite IIIs open level designs and objectives pack in more than enough variety and stealthy tension to counterbalance its thin story and shaky enemy intelligence and experimenting with its explosive traps is almost as fun as popping skulls with a sniper rifle.
Outward,PC,Mar-26-2019,Nine Dots Studio,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Survival | Open-World,PC Gamer,89,Outward is harsh and occasionally frustrating but it does what so few games do. It requires you to put real thought into the choices you make and it makes those choices feel like they really matter. Most of all it makes you approach each and every encounter as if your life depended on it—even though you never die.
The Town of Light,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,LKA Interactive | LKA,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Digitally Downloaded,100,I cannot thank the developer enough for The Town of Light. Not only are we beginning to acknowledge the injustices our ancestors committed we are exploring how to prevent it from happening again by telling these important stories instead of burying them.
DOOM 3 BFG Edition,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,id Software,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Compilation | First-Person | Sci-Fi,PSX-Sense.nl,85,Doom 3 is an old game and it definitely shows its age. If you however are willing to look past that obvious defect this game will prove that it is still just as nerve-wracking as it ever was.
Gravel,PlayStation 4,Feb-27-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Wccftech,80,While Gravel has issues like strange collisions cars literally merging into each other and some issues with shadows there is a lot to say about it. Theres a wide variety of racing types tracks and cars to use. Almost everything is fast paced and entertaining and simply gratifying. Simply put Gravel is a very good arcade style racing game and Milestones best game yet.
Azkend 2: The World Beneath,Xbox One,May-3-2016,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Matching,Brash Games,80,These minor wrinkles aside Azkend 2: The World Beneath is a great match 3 game from a developer that clearly understands the genre and knows how to give gamers what they want. It’s well worth the asking price and definitely worth your time.
Turok Remastered,PC,Dec-17-2015,Night Dive Studios,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,80,Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is an intriguing walk down memory lane and Night Dive Studios have done their usual good job of optimizing it for modern hardware. That said Turok hasn’t aged very well at all and there are some inherent flaws that keep the original from being as fun as the sequels.
White Day: A Labyrinth Named School,PlayStation 4,Aug-22-2017,ROIGAMES Inc.,Action Adventure | Survival,Digitally Downloaded,90,Yes White Day is an older game but as far as the horror genre goes and how its evolved into something I place little value in that’s actually a benefit. Given how few people have even known what this game is to date the extra exposure that it will get from a re-release will mean that hopefully a new legion of fans will discover it because it does deserve that. It’s a masterpiece in building tension and in the way that it plays within the classical approach to horror without relying on jump scares and endless bloodshed.
The Bradwell Conspiracy,PlayStation 4,Oct-8-2019,Bossa Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Playstation Official Magazine UK,80,Although it’s a bit buggy (we had to reload a few checkpoints to progress) it’s no secret that this will be five to six hours of your time well spent. [Issue#169 p.92]
The Lord of the Rings The Third Age,Game Boy Advance,Nov-2-2004,Griptonite Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,GBA Central,100,Comparable in many ways to Fire Emblem The Third Age betters it in many ways offering a more in-depth character management system deeper tactical options and a greater variety in mission objectives.

Wakeboarding Unleashed Featuring Shaun Murray,Game Boy Advance,Nov-10-2003,Small Rockets,Sports | Alternative | Wakeboarding,Gamer's Pulse,80,Excellent controls and a streamlined interface make playing a breeze on the smaller system.

Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters,Game Boy Advance,Feb-12-2003,Konami,Miscellaneous | Card Battle,GameSpy,90,After finally learning and understanding the nuances of the game I was hooked on one of the deepest GBA titles available. The game has its flaws but the plusses clearly outweigh the minuses.

RedCard 20-03,Xbox,Jun-24-2002,Point of View,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GameZone,76,It’s almost mind boggling how the opponent can easily deflect your super power kicks but totally not catch the weaker shots you happen to unleash.

Technic Beat,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Arika,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,eToychest,85,An extraordinary addition to the rhythm game genre. It offers simple pick-up-and-play mechanics that are easy to get into and significantly more difficult to put down.
UFO: Aftershock,PC,Nov-23-2005,Altar Interactive,Strategy | Turn-Based | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,eToychest,92,Aftershock is a very difficult but fun strategy title that marries strategic and tactical portions which are both compelling and fully-developed as well as an important RPG system which also interconnects quite well with the other portions of the game.

Railworks 3: Train Simulator 2012,PC,Sep-23-2011,RailSimulator.com,Simulation | Train | Vehicle | Train,GamingXP,80,A great way to try your hand at driving a train.

If you like trains but cant or wont go for a miniature train this simulation is for you.

If you are looking for an engaging and challenging title you and pick up and play on the go then look no further than Neon Chrome.

Looney Tunes: Cartoon Conductor,DS,Jun-10-2008,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GameZone,78,I wish the developers had done more with this game like include other modes or pursued the music idea further.

Rocket Arena,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2020,Final Strike Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,App Trigger,80,Rocket Arena is a fun game that offers a lot of features that players ask for all of the time in other games. You’ll have to ask yourself if you like this style of gameplay and the art style but the game is well designed and a blast to play. If it goes free to play eventually I think it can have sustained success.
FIFA Soccer 12,3DS,Sep-27-2011,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,Modojo,80,One hell of a sports game with plenty of options and teams to keep you kicking for months.
My World My Way,DS,Feb-3-2009,Global A,Role-Playing | General | General,IGN,80,Despite its repetitious feel and the inevitable grind that comes with leveling up and battling your way through dozens of hours of baddies My World My Way is a unique innovative and more importantly fun game.

Sky Force Anniversary,Switch,Nov-8-2018,Infinite Dreams Inc.,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,The Digital Fix,80,Sky Force Anniversary is an intense and well-designed shmup that’s a fitting addition to the Nintendo Switch. It’s great for long sessions as their are numerous medals and collectibles to grab in docked mode as well as short commute sessions in handheld mode. A few more story elements would have been ideal but the game’s addicting gameplay and upgrade system are enough to keep the player hooked. If it’s a high adrenaline bullet hell experience you’re looking to add to your Nintendo Switch collection look no further than Sky Force Anniversary.
Transference,Xbox One,Sep-18-2018,SpectreVision,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Generación Xbox,82,Singularly short but also singularly intense. Narrative of high flights with gameplay at height. It is recommended to play in one sitting.
Shining Resonance Refrain,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Sega,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GamingTrend,90,Shining Resonance Refrain is an entertaining adventure through a somewhat cliche story but it contains its own unique aspects that keep you engaged. Combat is easy to learn but theres a decent amount of depth to it. Dragonshift and B.A.N.D. sessions are wonderful combat mechanics that add more charm to the game. The relationship building and dating also adds a cute slice of life portion to the adventure.
Guns of Icarus Alliance,PlayStation 4,May-1-2018,Muse Games,Simulation | Space | Combat,GameSpace,80,The great news is that you can play across platforms with players on steam.
Urban Trial Playground,Switch,Apr-5-2018,Teyon | Tate Multimedia,Sports | Individual | Other | Biking,GameCritics,80,With a competitive Freestyle mode Urban Trial Playground would likely have earned itself a spot in the roster of local multi games I play with my roommates. I would have loved to compete with them for high scores in UTP’s impeccably designed courses. Unfortunately UTP’s multiplayer only offers the lesser of its two modes which means I’ve had all the enjoyment there is to have with it. I’ll think fondly of it but like those ’90s Capri Sun commercials its days are past.
Rad Rodgers,Xbox One,Feb-21-2018,Slipgate Studios LLC,3D | Action | Platformer | 2D,Generación Xbox,80,Rad Rodgers returns to the essence of the great platform classics of the 90s bringing its own personality. Despite its short duration Rad Rodgers is a must for lovers of the genre.

Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom,PlayStation 4,Apr-18-2017,Enigami,Role-Playing | Action RPG,RPG Fan,86,What French developer Enigami has managed to achieve with Shiness is admirable considering its humble beginnings. Its clear that a lot of blood sweat and tears went into making this adventure a reality. Its also clear that the developers fell victim to the same bogeymen that typically hinder most ambitious indie projects: time and money. Albeit flawed Shiness is an indie gem that doesnt quite live up to its potential yet still puts many big budget games to shame.
Resident Evil 7: biohazard - Banned Footage Vol. 2,PlayStation 4,Feb-14-2017,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,GameCritics,90,Once again the developers have demonstrated a remarkable ability to change what RE7 is and how it plays on a fundamental level. This is every bit as impressive as the rest of the game’s content but it feels completely fresh and unique just going to show what a stellar product Capcom has released. If only it was available in VR.
Super Mutant Alien Assault,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Cybernate | Chris Suffern,Action | Platformer | 2D,The Escapist,80,SMAA doesnt aim to do anything particularly novel preferring to embrace the clone nature of the game and make that aspect as good as it can be. Theres no doubt they made the right decision there as youll be hard pressed to not enjoy your time with SMAA.
Dex,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Dreadlocks Ltd | Dreadlocks,Role-Playing | Action RPG,CGMagazine,85,Even without the IP Dex manages to be the absolute best Ghost in the Shell game we’ve ever gotten.

The Showdown Effect,PC,Mar-5-2013,Arrowhead Game Studios,Action | General | General,Destructoid,85,Its a game that deserves to be played however and its one thats a hilarious spectacle to watch too -- something that Arrowhead clearly realizes and is keen to exploit with its Twitch.tv integration.
Primal Carnage,PC,Oct-29-2012,Lukewarm Media,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,ZTGD,80,Lukewarm Media set out to do one simple thing with Primal Carnage: let people play as and fight dinosaurs. They hit that mark and then some. Even with no level progression I still come back to it just to eat some humans. For $15 you get the closest thing there is to a Jurassic Park multiplayer game and it also happens to be a lot of fun.
Growlanser: Wayfarer of Time,PSP,Jul-31-2012,Career Soft,Role-Playing | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,ZTGD,87,Growlanser has flaws sure but the scope of the story and the complexity of the world beneath it really are fantastic. Dont give up on the game in the first hour or two it continues to improve and impress as you play.

Operation Flashpoint: Red River,PlayStation 3,Jun-7-2011,Codemasters,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamers.at,83,Red River may not be as hardcore as its predecessors while still being not nearly as cool and mass market compatible as the CoDs and MoHs out there but its still is a pretty good game. Especially if you manage to grab yourself three friends for some intense Coop-Multiplayer-Action.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney,Wii,Jan-11-2010,Capcom,Adventure | First-Person | Visual Novel | Modern | Modern,Nintendo Gamer,80,Great value. [Mar 2010 p.75]
Codename Panzers: Cold War,PC,Mar-10-2009,Stormregion,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,PC Games,84,While still a pretty good RTS Cold War lacks the tactical depth of its predecessors. Just pick a few tanks and roll over whatever resistance there is. The missions are too easy and the engine although bringing really good explosions to the screen slows down gameplay to less than 20 FPS.
The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga,PlayStation 2,Oct-28-2008,Terminal Reality,Miscellaneous | Compilation,PSX Extreme,88,All in all for a mere $30 whether on your PSP or PS2 The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga is a fantastic deal for a series of fantastic games.

Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team,Game Boy Advance,Sep-18-2006,ChunSoft,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,GameShark,100,The lesson here is that just because the license is for kids the game doesnt have to be.

Dracula: The Resurrection,PC,Jun-14-2000,Canal+ Multimedia,Adventure | First-Person | Point-and-Click | Modern | Fantasy | Modern,Four Fat Chicks,100,Seriously scary and atmospheric without being horrifying more of an elegant Vincent Price scare than an 80s slasher movie. Think Goth Disney and youve got the right idea.
Mystical Ninja starring Goemon,Nintendo 64,Mar-31-1998,Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka,Action | General,TotalGames.net,85,An enjoyable fun-filled game which should keep you puzzling for a long time to come.
Elex,PC,Oct-17-2017,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Meristation,85,A giant game in all aspects that conveys the sensation of influence on the virtual world. Some failures in control are the most negative point but ELEX is a new vindication of Piranha Bytes.
Transformers: Autobots,DS,Jun-19-2007,Vicarious Visions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,82,For a licensed game I think theyve done a very good job of creating a unique game experience that stays in step with the source material while creating a new enough experience to make the game fun. Plus the Allspark Wars function is awesome!
Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star,PlayStation 4,Jan-17-2017,Marvelous Inc.,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GameGrin,95,Aside from the repetitive gameplay this is a game that Fate fans will absolutely enjoy playing and exploring in an officially released Fate game since the Stay Night visual novels don’t seem to be coming out anytime soon including the several other games that spawned from this franchise. From a gaming perspective is a flawless execution of what a Servant would do against an army but is mechanically challenging.
Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!,3DS,Nov-13-2012,WayForward,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | General | Fantasy,IGN,85,WayForward has struck gold once again as the studio continues to prove its skill at crafting superb game designs for Nintendo platforms.

Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,PlayStation 3,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,GamesRadar+,80,We had trouble getting enough planes into the air though when we did the mode shone out as one of the better additions to this otherwise serviceable flyer.
Mount & Blade: Warband,PlayStation 4,Sep-13-2016,Koch Media | Taleworlds Entertainment,Role-Playing | Western-Style,GameGrin,90,Mount & Blade: Warband is one of the most unique experiences available on PS4.

Cleopatra: Riddle of the Tomb,PC,Mar-31-2008,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Game Chronicles,82,The bad dialogue took away for the otherwise sold Egyptian feel to the title.
The Club,PC,Feb-19-2008,Bizarre Creations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamer 2.0,80,The Club offers a great experience for all gamers who are looking for non-stop action while giving fans of old-school shooters something to talk about.
Call of Cthulhu,PC,Oct-29-2018,Cyanide | Cyanide Studios,Role-Playing | General,IGN,86,Call of Cthulhu is a dark ride through a mad cosmic horror nightmare with a paranormal detective story as your vehicle. Occasionally poor level and encounter design can make the eerily atmospheric road a little bumpy but the engaging mystery and an intriguing utilization of RPG mechanics make it one of the more enjoyable Lovecraftian games in years.
MySims SkyHeroes,Wii,Sep-28-2010,Electronic Arts | Behaviour Interactive,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Vandal,82,Despite not being an ambitious game we have liked a lot this MySims SkyHeroes.

Nerf N-Strike Elite,Wii,Oct-26-2009,EA Salt Lake,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,IGN,75,Even with that lessened impact Nerf N-Strike Elite is a really good kid-friendly choice thats got some bang for the buck.

[Dec 2008 p.52]
Mini-Mech Mayhem,PlayStation 4,Jun-18-2019,FuturLab,Action | General,UploadVR,80,Mini-Mech Mayhem is likely destined for the same kind of obscurity as FuturLab’s Tiny Trax before it but there’s endless joy to be found from its frantic mash-up of tabletop gaming and VR. This is an untamable often hilarious bit of strategy that’s to be enjoyed just as much when you’re throwing your hands up in defeat as it is in victory. I just wish I had more people to play it with.
Pro Cycling Manager Season 2014: Le Tour de France,PC,Jun-19-2014,Cyanide,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Biking,Gaming Nexus,88,The changes and additions to Pro Cycling Manager 2014 are really quite impressive.

Weedcraft Inc,PC,Apr-11-2019,Vile Monarch,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,Digitally Downloaded,90,This isn’t a game which cracks easy jokes about weed culture; it doesn’t underestimate the finesse involved in the craft; but it also doesn’t shy away from criticising the shadier aspects of the industry either. It’s a truly fascinating look into a mythologised trade and it’ll be a test for the most seasoned of tycoon fans.
Tony Hawk's Project 8,Xbox,Nov-7-2006,Shaba Games,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Game Chronicles,88,If you must play the game on the old Xbox youll still have a good time; albeit a lonely time. Just dont play it on the 360 or you might never be satisfied with your classic system again. Tony has definitely made the jump to next-gen and you might want to do the same.
Warhammer 40000: Kill Team,Xbox 360,Jul-13-2011,THQ Warrington,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,ZTGD,87,A fantastic update to the classic twin-stick shooter formula. I would be thrilled to see either a more substantial retail release using this format or an online-enabled downloadable sequel.
Genesis Alpha One,PC,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameGrin,90,Genesis Alpha One is a game that I love coming back to for both short and long bursts. It’s got an absolute ton of replayability with some really interesting designs and mechanics to boot.
Bus Simulator 18,PC,Jun-13-2018,stillalive studios,Simulation | Vehicle | Civilian,Impulsegamer,80,There’s not a lot to it but what there is can be a pleasant distraction from every day life for a while… even if it does simulate a form of every day life for some people. If you like simulation style games you will most likely find enjoyment in this one… if not then this might be worth giving a miss. For me it was another nice easy going title to add to my collection… now if you don’t mind I’m going to switch the radio to easy listening and raise the ramp and head off.
Disneyland Adventures,Xbox One,Oct-31-2017,Asobo Studio,Action Adventure | General,Windows Central,90,With a vast virtual park to explore loads of beloved characters and plenty of minigames Disneyland Adventures is one of the best Disney games out there.

The X-Files: Resist or Serve,PlayStation 2,Mar-16-2004,Black Ops Entertainment,Adventure | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Computer Games Magazine,83,Truly makes gamers feel as if theyre controlling a lost episode. [July 2004 p.7]
R: Racing Evolution,Xbox,Dec-9-2003,Namco,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Official Xbox Magazine,85,Car models and framerates are superb and some of the courses look great but overally you could be forgiven for thinking youd turned on your PS2. [Jan 2004 p.60]
NBA Jam 2004,PlayStation 2,Sep-23-2003,Acclaim,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,Next Level Gaming,88,The Legends Tournament alone is reason to own NBA Jam.
Smash Cars,PlayStation 2,Aug-13-2003,Creat Studios,Driving | Car Combat,Game Chronicles,81,Smash Cars has managed to make an RC racer believer out of me. While I doubt I will be running to my hobby shop to invest in a $200 RC truck or car (one that I would probably break my first time out) I will certainly be spending countless hours driving these miniature racers in one of the best PS2 racing games I have played this year.
Tennis Masters Series 2003,Xbox,Aug-7-2003,Microids,Sports | Traditional | Tennis,XboxAddict,92,The addition of a create-a-player mode and some sort of system link or On-line capabilities would have put TMS near the top of this genre. But kudos for a solid and exciting gaming experience.
Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs,PC,May-19-2002,Blue Fang Games,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Game Over Online,76,They filled it with a lot of nice additions but the dinosaurs are basically just really big animals and their inclusion doesn’t change by much how you play the game.
PaRappa the Rapper 2,PlayStation 2,Jan-23-2002,NanaOn-Sha,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,GamerWeb Sony,85,Sure the story is a little weird and yes the music isnt quite as good as it was in the first game but PaRappa 2 is a solid effort nonetheless.
Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon,PSP,May-15-2007,ArtePiazza,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Management | Breeding/Constructing | Business / Tycoon,PSM3 Magazine UK,85,It wont convince some but the more open-minded will revel in these calm cheerful engaging fields. Gorgeous. [May 2007 p.68]
State of Emergency,Xbox,Mar-26-2003,VIS Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,80,While its not an entirely brilliant game the multiplayer feature and the sharper graphics make this the essential version to own.
Joy Ride Turbo,Xbox 360,May-23-2012,BigPark,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Worth Playing,80,Is Joy Ride Turbo worth checking out? Absolutely! It doesnt reinvent the wheel and actually seems quite content to imitate the standard Mario Kart formula. However that formula is pretty well realized and even without an interesting license to back it up its a lot of fun to play with friends.
Dreamfall Chapters,PlayStation 4,May-5-2017,Red Thread Games,Fantasy | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Cubed3,90,This particular game is a joy and has a story that has a conclusion that is worth the time and effort. It might not please all fans of its prequels due to its obscure time-hopping scenes but even they should love the final catch-all scene. It is an excellent entry to the universe and a fantastic addition to the PS4 catalogue and will leave most hoping for another game in the future.
Spaceball: Revolution,Wii,Sep-14-2009,Virtual Toys,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,N-Europe,80,Precise controls and a simple yet solid game concept make for an addictive gameplay experience that is well worth the Points!
Shenmue III,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2019,Ys Net,Action Adventure | Open-World,Digitally Downloaded,100,Shenmue 3 wont disappoint fans of the first two. But thats almost secondary to the real story here. Shenmue 3s real strength is in the way that it suggests a different way of looking at the very storytelling of videogames. It challenges the idea that a games value is in it aspiring to be cinema and it provides a pretty compelling argument for the alternative too. On a personal note as a fan of both theatre and Shenmue this game is effortlessly my pick of what has been a very good 2019 for the creative side of videogames.
RAGE 2,PlayStation 4,May-14-2019,id Software | Avalanche Studios,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Jeuxvideo.com,85,Rage 2 shines in its gunfights driving sequences and from the fun perks and upgrades that you can use.

Outlaw Tennis,PlayStation 2,Jul-26-2005,Hypnotix,Sports | Traditional | Tennis,Next Level Gaming,85,Despite Outlaw series games not being exactly the model of authenticity when it comes to sports games they know how to make a fun game. Tennis is no exception. The issues I take with the repetitive animations sound and the ball physics are really minor when it comes to these games.
Worms Forts: Under Siege,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,82,Playing Worms Forts is not entirely unlike finding that you have just been poured the worm out of the bottom of a tequila bottle. Youre not entirely sure about whether its a good thing or not; but swig back this odd looking creature and an hour later good times follow.
The Almost Gone,PC,Jun-25-2020,Happy Volcano,Adventure | General,The Digital Fix,80,Beautiful in its simplicity The Almost Gone is definitely a game that won’t appeal to everyone but for this reviewer it was a worthwhile experience. Some frustratingly obtuse puzzle solutions aside the 3D point and click gaming is well-designed and the minimalist art style fits perfectly. It also packs an emotional punch for anyone familiar with the tragic issues portrayed which it deals with sensitively and powerfully.
Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom,Xbox One,Apr-18-2017,Enigami,Role-Playing | Action RPG,TheXboxHub,90,All in all Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom is a phenomenal game that deserves to be played and enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of RPG action games.
Ride 2,PC,Oct-7-2016,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Game Debate,85,A new climate and a lick of paint have made another game in practically the precise mould of the brilliant Sniper Elite III so I cant really complain. Its like going back to your favourite restaurant and ordering what you always order. Sure its a bloody delight and theres not much bad to say about it but perhaps something slightly different (aware as I am that this is vague and ill-defined) might have been nice?
Battle Fantasia,PlayStation 3,Dec-22-2009,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,70,Theres a decent fighting system underneath all the pencil-sketches and pixie dust. [Mar 2009 p.102]
Mafia III,Xbox One,Oct-7-2016,Hangar 13,Action Adventure | Open-World,Forbes,81,If you approach Mafia III as an interactive journey then you probably won’t have any issue with it overall. If you’re looking for a fully fleshed out title akin to GTA then Mafia III could come off as a shallow release...I’m somewhere in the middle but leaning more toward the former. The story and visuals are easily the strength of the game and the gameplay isn’t flawed or repetitive enough to kill the vibe.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations,Wii,May-10-2010,Capcom,Adventure | First-Person | Visual Novel | Modern | Modern,NintendoWorldReport,85,A great game and the best entry in the franchise. The storyline never fails to impress: it dives very deep into the darkest pits of the human mind while still having a sense of humor about it.
Need for Speed Carbon,Wii,Nov-19-2006,EA Canada,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,NintendoWorldReport,85,Instead of porting it over without much thought they took the time to get something working that took advantage of the Wiis strengths.
Thief,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2014,Eidos Montreal,Fantasy | Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,Eurogamer Italy,90,One of the best action-stealth titles in years and the first serious contender for the 2014 Game of the Year contest.
Giraffe and Annika,PC,Feb-17-2020,Atelier Mimina,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Digital Chumps,85,This game’s animation is a beautiful combination of 3D and comic book-like graphics. It is a refreshing take on an adventure and rhythm game and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. This is definitely a game to add to your Steam Wishlist.
Red Johnson's Chronicles,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Lexis Numerique,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,Gameblog.fr,80,Red Johnsons Chronicles is a nice and fresh adventure game. Its gameplays varied its story OK and its universe is worth a shot. The only downfalls of Lexis Numériques Game are to be a little too easy and some tiny shortcomings to get rid of for the sequel.
Haunting Ground,PlayStation 2,May-10-2005,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,Pelit (Finland),89,A good-looking puzzle-oriented horror game. It has an innovative panic system and a dramatic storyline. The adventure and the puzzles are well balanced which makes Haunting Ground a very enjoyable experience. [May 05]
CivCity: Rome,PC,Jul-24-2006,Firaxis Games | FireFly Studios,Strategy | City Building | Management | Historic | Historic | Government,IGN,82,The interaction between the buildings could definitely be a little more complicated but the challenges of fitting everything together is more than sufficient to keep you coming back for more.
Kane & Lynch: Dead Men,PC,Nov-20-2007,Io Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameTrailers,80,The right combination of gameplay elements and design decisions make Kane and Lynch easy to recommend to crime junkies and anyone who enjoys a little therapeutic videogame violence. A well-executed plot really makes the game while the multiplayer additions add replay value and variety.
Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes,Switch,Jan-18-2019,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GamingTrend,90,Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes is outrageous. The game is uncompromisingly zany: full of smart design fluid combat and laugh out loud personality front to back. While some may be turned off by its low budget feel and disjointed design those who can look past these rough edges will find a hack-and-slash so quirky that it’ll be tough not to fall in love. This title stands as a shining beacon of bold creativity and anyone who values risk-taking in games owes it to themself to give Travis Strikes Again a shot.
Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation,PlayStation Vita,Jan-27-2015,Felistella,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,90,It pushes more boundaries and is a sharper satire than the other games in the series as fine as they are and that marks this one out as something special indeed.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Xbox,Jun-2-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Games Radar,80,A genuinely good third-year romp for Harry. Accomplished and absorbing its not quite magical but its certainly no muggle either. [GamesMaster]
Champions of Anteria,PC,Aug-30-2016,Blue Byte,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Areajugones,80,This game perfectly mixes strategy with role playing. Its progression system is very complete and the story that it features is funny and interesting.
Castlevania: Harmony of Despair,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2010,Konami,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,100,A fascinating multiplayer experiment but also a really solid streamlined single player vania. [Nov 2010 p.120]
Dynasty Warriors Next,PlayStation Vita,Feb-21-2012,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,PlayStation Universe,85,A great rendition of an old IP by using the functionality of the PS Vita in the best ways.
Blair Witch,Xbox One,Aug-30-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,SomosXbox,85,Blair Witch is a great horror experience. Its frightening and agonizing. It takes us back to our deeper fears. Despite not being technically impressing gameplay and story manage to shine. Bloober Team shows us once more why is one of the best horror studios in the whole videogame industry.
Dissidia: Final Fantasy NT,PlayStation 4,Jan-30-2018,Team Ninja,Action | Fighting | 3D,Digitally Downloaded,90,This is genuinely the first time I’ve ever been hooked on an online-orientated competitive game.
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,PlayStation 3,Jun-30-2009,Activision,Action | General | General,PGNx Media,80,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is very sharp lighthearted and fun game that will please younger fans of the movie with its varied gameplay good looks and clever writing. A recommended purchase for fans of the movie.
Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Protoman,Game Boy Advance,Jun-21-2005,Capcom,Role-Playing | Action RPG,eToychest,83,If you can stomach or even master the unforgiving battle conditions its a good game with an okay story and good combat.
World Championship Poker: Deluxe Series,DS,Apr-17-2005,Sensory Sweep,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,RewiredMind,80,Poker fans will lap this up and a few non-poker fans like myself will become converts simply due to the fact that the game explains things so clearly. As much as the laws of logic say that I shouldnt be saying this World Championship Poker is a highly addictive game.
Yo-kai Watch Blasters: White Dog Squad,3DS,Sep-7-2018,Level 5,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,90,Overall the game is fantastic. It’s fun for solo play and is even better when working in co-op. I’ve poured hours into the game and have still not completed every possible task available. There’s so much replayability and it’ll have you craving for more Yo-kai madness… or maybe a Yo-kai is making you think that. Regardless the game is definitely fantastic and I’d highly recommend adding it to your 3DS’s library.
State of Mind,PlayStation 4,Aug-15-2018,Daedalic Entertainment,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,Worth Playing,85,Utilizing thought-provoking puzzles and intuitive gameplay makes State of Mind a fun experience that keeps us hooked until the very end. With so much to look at and explore the title does an excellent job of world-building and creating a fully realized society. Its a deep game with much lore that adds to the genre. Where State of Mind excels in providing excellent gameplay visuals and plot hooks it falters in being able to answer many of the questions that it poses. Depending on which ending players arrive at you could be left asking Is that it? Despite its flaws however State of Mind kept us hooked until the very end. If one can overlook the plot inconsistencies State of Mind is a deep story about the what-ifs of humanitys future.
All Zombies Must Die!,PlayStation 3,Dec-27-2011,Doublesix,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Games Master UK,90,Theres also a fantastic variety to the undead. [Apr 2012 p.87]
Double Cross,Switch,Jan-10-2019,13AM Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpace,90,A great meshing of different types of gameplay styles that I love.
Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered,PC,Jul-3-2018,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,GameSpace,85,While Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered doesnt bring any new content to the ten year old game the graphics upgrade is well worth checking out as it brings it up to par with all but the top-tier AAA titles of recent times.
Corpse Party: Book of Shadows,PSP,Jan-15-2013,5pb,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Horror | Horror | Survival,PlayStation Universe,90,A literary masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of video games being legitimate art with its suspenseful thrilling and unique narrative that takes the horror genre to a new level. It is a classic for those Halloween fright nights but just make sure to double check the doors are locked when you turn the lights out.
Code of Princess,3DS,Oct-9-2012,Studio Saizensen,Role-Playing | Action RPG | General | Action RPG,ZTGD,93,The gurus at Atlas have once again graced us with a fantastic piece of gaming art. If you own a 3DS then you owe it to yourself to try this great game.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,PC,May-25-2004,KnowWonder,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer's Hell,85,It is easy enough for a kid to master and offers enough depth for adults to enjoy.
Dead to Rights,PC,Nov-10-2003,Namco,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameZone,79,Fairly solid gameplay experience but it really does feel like it was made for a console.
Blackthorne,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2003,Mass Media,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Game Informer,80,There arent many thinking-mans action games like this on the GBA. [Dec 2003 p.187]

Tsugunai: Atonement,PlayStation 2,Nov-29-2001,Cattle Call,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,IGN,84,Finally PS2 has a decent RPG. Granted you have to get past the graphics but that battle engine just had me wanting to play more and more.
NFL Quarterback Club 2002,PlayStation 2,Sep-5-2001,Acclaim,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GameZone,90,Not exactly a brain buster this game is good for hanging out with friends eating drinking and yelling at the screen...just like a real game.
Star Wars: Demolition,Dreamcast,Nov-19-2000,Luxoflux | Inc.,Driving | Car Combat,Sega X,90,The thing with Star Wars Demolition is that you have to be patient. Even Master Yoda would advise patience in this instance.
Uncharted: Fight for Fortune,PlayStation Vita,Dec-4-2012,Sony Bend,Strategy | Action Adventure | Turn-Based | Modern | Modern | Card Battle,GameCritics,80,Although the core Uncharted titles might not do much for me Fight for Fortune is a respectably entertaining title for players who enjoy the CCG genre. It might not have the same run-and-gun Nathan Drake is usually known for but Ill take card combos and strategy over killing a thousand generic thugs and auto-climbing ledges any day.
DC Universe Online,PlayStation 3,Jan-11-2011,WBIE,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,TheSixthAxis,90,DC Universe Online is ground-breaking; its innovative and downright addictive.
Sea of Thieves,PC,Mar-20-2018,Rare Ltd.,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Massively Multiplayer | Open-World,Hooked Gamers,90,Its not just the legend of my pirate its each and every player out there. Each with a different story each with something that is so much more beyond the fetch-quest guilds. Im hooked on this game already and knowing Rares passion for Sea of Thieves I think were in store for even more great things in the future. You need only answer the call of the sea; you are a pirate.
Top Spin,PlayStation 2,Sep-26-2005,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Tennis,Thunderbolt,90,Made from the same people that gave us the rather loveable Links 2004 this really is a game let alone a tennis game that you shouldn’t be without.
Ministry of Broadcast,PC,Jan-30-2020,Homeless Unicorn | Ministry of Broadcast Studios,Adventure | General,3DJuegos,80,Its hard for Ministry of Broadcast to left anyone indifferent. Its simply made with a craft that I missed. Its puzzles and platforms always invite you to continue never overwhelming or demoralizing. Like the reality shows its inspired by its morbid chaotic and you never know whats going to happen next.

Tycoon City: New York,PC,Feb-21-2006,Deep Red,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Play.tm,84,Whats great about Tycoon City: New York is its accessibility. Whether youre a rookie on the bottom rung of the tycoon-gaming ladder or an old hand friends with Sir Alan Sugar and as proud as can be with your magnificent railroads rollercoasters pizza restaurants and intergalactic cityscapes the game never tries to make you feel unwelcome or try to confuse you.
CounterSpy,PlayStation 4,Aug-19-2014,Dynamighty,Action | General,PlayStation Universe,95,Save the Moon in Counterspy a title created by a team of incredibly talented developers and creators from many different mediums. Experience Bond-esque style in a brand new way.
Resident Evil 6,Xbox 360,Oct-2-2012,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,NZGamer,95,If you were left wanting in RE5 theres a good chance RE6 will satisfy you. Theres a reason youre being fired at there are plenty of tense moments and stress the storytelling is superb and zombies make a return.
The Simpsons Road Rage,GameCube,Dec-17-2001,Radical Entertainment,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Nintendo Power,92,Load time can be as slow as Homers wit but thats small beans when Road Rage is one of the wildest – and funniest – rides around. [Jan 2002 p.126]
Help Will Come Tomorrow,PC,Apr-21-2020,Arclight Creations,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Ragequit.gr,84,A survivalism and class struggle epic unfolding amidst the pines of the Russian taiga and the steel rails of the Trans-Siberian railway. A title that manages to explore a bunch of ever-relevant questions while avoiding to get preachy.
Elli,Switch,Jan-10-2019,Bandana Kid,Action Adventure | Linear,4Players.de,77,A beautifully relaxed puzzle adventure hat is held back by some technical shortcomings and sluggish controls.
Urban Trial Freestyle 2,3DS,Mar-30-2017,Teyon | Tate Multimedia,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Nintendo Enthusiast,85,The first Urban Trial Freestyle was already a pretty fun game so this sequel simply took a solid foundation and built upon it. With the hefty amount of courses a track builder online leaderboards great visuals and engaging gameplay I can definitely say that this game is worth picking up if you’re into racers and/or physics-based titles. Seeing that it only costs $7 you really don’t have much to lose. While there is a bit of a learning curve once you get the hang of it the experience is pretty fun.
Uncanny Valley,PC,Apr-23-2015,Cowardly Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,Twinfinite,100,The game creates a compelling sense of dread and packs just enough into a relatively small package that multiple plays are essentially required just to find everything that it has to offer. For anyone that’s a fan of a less action-oriented style of horror the seething mysteries of Uncanny Valley are definitely worth looking into.
LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Nintendo Power,85,The action looks fantastic on the Nintendo 3DS handheld and the systems 3D effect gives each colorful setting a real feeling of depth. [Apr 2011 p.81]
Mega Man X: Command Mission,GameCube,Sep-21-2004,Capcom,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Kombo,85,The game seems unpleasantly short however  in less than sixteen hours of play I had cleared six of the games ten story chapters.
Miitopia,3DS,Jul-28-2017,Nintendo,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,The narrative is on the light-side but that makes it perfect for short bursts at a time. By the time I came to the end of Miitopia I found it slightly emotional to say goodbye to my companions of more than a decade but it was truly worth the ride.
Cel Damage,GameCube,Jan-7-2002,Pseudo Interactive,Driving | Racing | Kart,Hot Games,80,It belongs on the Game Cube -- the fast-paced action silly game play and innovative graphics will find a more appreciative audience here.
Guinness World Records: The Videogame,Wii,Nov-11-2008,TT Fusion,Action | General | General,VideoGamer,80,With record breaking as the foundation and a strong selection of fun mini-games to play a well as leaderboards and multiplayer games Guinness World Records: The Videogame is an excellent party game.
The Park,PC,Oct-27-2015,Funcom,Action Adventure | Survival,LEVEL (Czech Republic),80,A haunted walk through the smelling amusement park can surprise entertaining and frightening at the same time. The park is ideal leisure for one autumn evening. [Issue#258]
Secret Files 3,PC,Sep-13-2012,Animation Arts,Adventure | General | General,PC Games,85,Animation Arts has again created a felicitous adventure in its well known adventure series Secret Files. Secret Files 3 (Geheimakte 3) brings great and diversified puzzles (for experts maybe to easy sometimes) and again mixes a fictitious story with real historical events. Even the mini games are fitting in and leave you the choice of two levels of difficulty. Orchestration dramatic and cinematic presentation in Secret Files 3 are great and the game even provides several playable characters also as endings - depending on the decisions you make. Although the game lacks optimization of animations and the graphic presentation is getting kind of outdated due to the age of the engine the game still looks pretty good. Overall its quite a recommendation for all adventure gamers.
MySims Racing,DS,Jun-12-2009,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart | Automobile,NintendoWorldReport,80,My Sims Racing is a surprisingly tight game with great production values and a lot of heart and it can’t be recommended highly enough for the younger gamers among us. There may not be enough content to fulfill older gamers but it’s certainly a fun multiplayer game.
Men's Room Mayhem,PlayStation Vita,May-21-2013,Sawfly Studios,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,77,A surprisingly engrossing - and gross - time management sim. [Sept 2013 p.73]
East India Company,PC,Jul-28-2009,Nitro Games,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Gamer Limit,80,East India Company offers everything it promises - an enthralling experience of power greed and sunken ships.
Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu,Xbox,Oct-16-2003,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameShark,82,A nice beat em up that is pleasant to look at offers a wide variety of different moves and chracters and a nice two-player co-op mode that makes the game a lot more valuable to adults and kids that want to pal around Gotham as their favorite super hero.
The Godfather II,PlayStation 3,Apr-7-2009,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Adventure | Third-Person | Historic | Linear | Open-World | Modern,GamePro,100,It isnt the best open-world game out there but it does a sublime job of capturing what it feels like to be the head of a virtual crime family. [Apr 2009 p.81]
Shank,PC,Oct-25-2010,Klei Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,ZTGD,89,I really enjoyed Shank. It was a somewhat short experience of around four hours but the entire time I was having fun. The combat and the platforming all flow so smoothly throughout the game.
NFL Head Coach 09,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Management | Management | Sim,GameShark,83,Even with its quirks and bugs NFL Head Coach 09 is the type of game that will silently siphon away hours of your free time. Sitting down at night after the family has gone to bed to get in an hour or so of game time only to discover that all of a sudden it’s the middle of the night and your eyes are straining.
The Council - Episode 2: Hide and Seek,PlayStation 4,May-15-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,GameCritics,85,For a second time the developers of The Council have proven that there’s life and spirit in Interactive Movie genre making the most elaborately interactive entry the genre has seen. Of course since this is only the second entry in a five-part series players can expect it to end at a point designed to leave them desperate for more and it does. The third installment can’t get here fast enough!
Outcast: Second Contact,Xbox One,Nov-7-2017,Appeal | Bigben Games,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Open-World,AusGamers,80,Outside of the story exploration and puzzles combat can play an equally big part in the overall story. But underneath the shiny new visuals Outcast remains pretty much the same. Which means controls and combat that was fine if a little clumsy in 1999 is even more so today. But just like then it’s quickly overlooked for what is an adventure quite unlike any other. An impressively realised world filled with character moments of sheer triumph and charm. Outcast: Second Contact is well worth a look for both fans and newcomers alike.
Claire: Extended Cut,Xbox One,Sep-6-2016,Hailstorm Games Inc,Adventure | General,ICXM,80,It tells a complex but intelligent story. It utilizes art design to enhance the gameplay. It uses sound design to terrify the player. And it delivers it all in an easily digestible package with replay value. I would consider Claire an excellent entry into the horror game genre.
Redeemer: Enhanced Edition,PlayStation 4,Jul-19-2019,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,IGN Spain,85,An heir to the ultraviolence of Hotline Miami really deep funny and replayable.
Picross S,Switch,Sep-28-2017,Jupiter Corporation,Puzzle | Logic,God is a Geek,90,A fantastic puzzle game that is almost perfect on the Nintendo Switch.
Disney's Chicken Little,GameCube,Oct-20-2005,Avalanche Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,Play Magazine,85,Who knew kicking arse with a chicken (wielding a yo-yo no less) could be so super-cool? [Nov p.93]
Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto's Rampage,Game Boy Advance,Jun-3-2004,Vicarious Visions,Action | Platformer | 2D,PGNx Media,83,As long as you aren’t expecting another great platformer Crash Purple works.
Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King,PlayStation 2,Feb-11-2004,Banpresto,Action | General,Play Magazine,83,The game contains bits of combat Tomb Raider-ish puzzle solving and environmental hazzards. [JPN Import; Mar 2003 p.63]
R: Racing Evolution,GameCube,Dec-9-2003,Namco,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,TotalGames.net,84,Every member of the CUBE team was looking forward to this and they all left the first session grumbling words like disaster bollocks ad dont give up the day job Namco. Its slow dull and tedious. Dont get too depressed though because there is a light at the end of this tunnel.
Pirate Hunter,PC,Oct-17-2003,Ascaron Entertainment GmbH | Ascaron Entertainment,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GameZone,83,If you enjoy action games with a dash of strategy that are open ended have a good amount of replay value and offer you the chance to play as you wish then you should definitely check it out.
Earth 2150: Lost Souls,PC,Sep-9-2002,Zuxxez,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Yahoo!,80,If its a strategic challenge youre after Lost Souls might well be the game for you and we dont hesitate before recommending it for anyone with the pang for tactics.
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Rogue Spear: Black Thorn,PC,Oct-31-2001,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Electric Playground,79,Makes a nice package and is a good ride for fans of the series. Its probably a little rough on newbies though.
Extermination,PlayStation 2,Jul-23-2001,Deep Space,Action Adventure | Horror,Hot Games,90,Although not terrible complicated or intricate it’s still a great game with a good interface and lots of scary stuff.
World War Z,PlayStation 4,Apr-16-2019,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Gaming Age,91,I’d absolutely suggest giving World War Z a shot even more so if you were a fan of Left 4 Dead. It really scratches that itch namely a fun zombie focused co-op shooter with a solid progression system that’ll keep you hooked for a while. So despite its association with a so-so horror film World War Z manages to rise above its source material into something that I found to be a lot of fun.
Spintires: Mudrunner,PlayStation 4,Oct-31-2017,Koch Media,Simulation | Vehicle | Civilian,Everyeye.it,76,Mud Runner ultimately is an outstanding title ... in the narrowest sense of the term.
The Sims 3: Showtime,PC,Mar-6-2012,The Sims Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,GamingXP,87,If you own The Sims 3 and want to have even more fun you absolutely should get the Showtime expansion.
Dungeonland,PC,Jan-29-2013,Critical Studio,Action | General | General,Hooked Gamers,85,Despite these minor criticisms the game is brilliant. Having played it both with friends and alone it is obvious that this game is -supposed- to be played with friends. When playing alone it feels a bit repetitive but when you add two friends screaming commands in your ear and a third one laughing manically as he plots your demise this game is pure candy. If you enjoy playing this kind of game with friends you will love Dungeonland. If you are a friendless loner however you might want to give it a miss.
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,GameCube,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Play Magazine,85,With any luck Kromes overhaul will prove lucrative enough to warrant them continuing the brand flying Spyro into next-gen skies and who knows perhaps a veritable rebirth. [Oct. 2006 p.54]
Felix the Reaper,Switch,Oct-17-2019,Kong Orange,Adventure | General,Pure Nintendo,85,Even if puzzle games aren’t really your thing the standard of writing and quality of Felix’s dancing are too good to pass up. If puzzle games are for you then look no further than Felix the Reaper.
Infernium,Switch,Apr-5-2018,Carlos Coronado,Action Adventure | General,NintendoWorldReport,85,Overall this game left me in shambles as I would feel a sense of extreme dread as I made progress throughout each world as I never fully knew what reaction any of my decisions could cause. However it gave me a sense of relief and wonder when I would solve the puzzle given to me and continue forward to see what challenges awaited me next.
Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame,PlayStation 4,Feb-13-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,COGconnected,80,Another cool feature is the track surface. It is fully deformable meaning that the dirt surface changes consistency when it gets wet. The physics dynamics of driving on a dry surface versus blasting and sliding through mud changes your approach to racing on a track.
Dead Island: Definitive Collection,Xbox One,May-31-2016,Techland,Miscellaneous | Compilation,ICXM,75,I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to newcomers but not so much to returning players. It’s a lot of fun no matter what but Dead Island is much more enjoyable the first time around. Just take that into account when making a purchasing decision.

Blood Will Tell,PlayStation 2,Sep-21-2004,Paon Corporation,Action Adventure | Fantasy,AceGamez,90,Offers a wonderfully enjoyable narrative with slick controls and an absence of any significant problems.

Super Daryl Deluxe,PlayStation 4,Apr-10-2018,Dan & Gary Games,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PlayStation Universe,90,I cannot overstate the hilarity in this game.

Rayman Raving Rabbids,Xbox 360,Apr-24-2007,Ubisoft Montpellier,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 3D | 3D,Play Magazine,90,Admittedly I may be partially swayed by the HD graphics a pair of new mini-games and lightning-fast load times but even though the game remains the same I found the localized familiarity of my 360 buttons slightly more appealing than the Wiimote and Nunchuk.

Rocketbirds 2: Evolution,PlayStation 4,Apr-26-2016,Ratloop Asia Pte Ltd,Action | Platformer | 2D,PSNStores,90,Rocketbirds 2: Evolution is just about everything I wanted from a sequel.

The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics,PC,Feb-4-2020,BonusXP,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,PC Gamer,75,It’s not going to rock anyone’s world but for a cheap TV tie-in it’s a lot more engaging than it has any right to be serving as a pleasant opportunity for any series fan to spend a few more hours in Gelfling company.
Scanner Sombre,PC,Apr-26-2017,Introversion Software,Action Adventure | Linear,Game Informer,80,Perhaps what’s most impressive to me is how effectively lean Scanner Sombre is. The entire game is only three hours. Mechanically speaking there isn’t much you do outside of using the scanner to solve puzzles find your way and outwit foes. However the foreboding atmosphere and where its plot ultimately leads is satisfying enough that its gameplay and storytelling are compelling. Whether you’re coming across a new upgrade for your LIDAR or slowly mapping out a spooky tunnel and inching toward danger Scanner Sombre is a consistently spooky and somber game that’s worthwhile for those who want to scratch that horror-adventure itch.
Pacific Storm,PC,Oct-2-2006,Lesta Studio,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Worth Playing,85,Pacific Storm is a remarkable offering for armchair commanders who enjoy micromanaging all aspects of war.

Playing on the Switch allows you to play with it anywhere especially if you’re midway through one of the frustrating boss fights. It doesn’t quite look as good as when it’s docked but the game is still vibrant and lovely to look at. If you want something that reminds you what the 80s were like and fancy a game that fully embraces the notion of retro Crossing Souls is the embodiment of it.
Tyranny: Bastard's Wound,PC,Sep-7-2017,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Ragequit.gr,80,Players who appreciated what Tyranny has to offer will definitely enjoy Bastards Wound as the side content it introduces is of the highest quality and true to the standards set by its developers.

Galaga,Xbox 360,Jul-26-2006,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,VGPub,85,Galaga is still the classic game that’s loved by many but it doesn’t feel right.

Outlaw Tennis,Xbox,Jul-26-2005,Hypnotix,Sports | Traditional | Tennis,Game Chronicles,92,The best news is that Outlaw Tennis is at its core a fantastic tennis game so when you eventually turn off all the outlaw flavor you still have a remarkably fun challenging and somewhat realistic tennis game to occupy countless gaming hours both solo and online.
Double Dragon: Neon,Xbox 360,Sep-12-2012,WayForward,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameWatcher,90,Double Dragon Neon is evidence.

Age of Mythology: Extended Edition,PC,May-8-2014,Ensemble Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer,77,Age of Mythology still has a lot of value beyond nostalgia then but I’d wait for a discount before committing your cash especially if you already bought it a decade ago. This isn’t a total remake so don’t go in expecting one.

Impact Winter,PlayStation 4,Apr-5-2018,Mojo Bones,Adventure | General,Multiplayer.it,76,Impact Winter is a good survival game flawed by some technical issues. However if you love its genre you may want to give it a shot.
Earthlock: Festival of Magic,Xbox One,Sep-1-2016,Snow Castle Games,Role-Playing | General,GameSpew,80,Whilst the art style here verges on the cartoonish the gorgeous sense of colour and texture really brings the world alive.

Transformers: Decepticons,DS,Jun-19-2007,Vicarious Visions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,82,For a licensed game I think the developers have done a very good job of creating a unique game experience that lets you experience the source material in two completely different ways. With an innovative multiplayer function unique story mode and good technical specs Transformers: Decepticons looks like it may be so good its evil.
Geist,GameCube,Aug-15-2005,n-Space,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,N-Insanity,88,The unique multiplayer modes offer a different type of multiplayer experience and can be a ton of fun for long term FPS fans. In addition (I reiterate this point) the style of gameplay is so rarely seen that I suggest everyone at least try it out before turning away from it.
The Sims 4,Xbox One,Nov-17-2017,Maxis,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,Xbox Tavern,84,The Sims 4 once again proves that a good PC game that’s primarily designed for keyboard and mouse simply doesn’t suit the controller. It’s but one of the many reasons that Microsoft needs to pull their fingers out and enable keyboard and mouse support for the Xbox One not only will it help the transition of games like this and Divinity Original Sin but it will add more appeal too.
Rubik's World,DS,Oct-28-2008,Two Tribes,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Game Informer,80,There’s plenty here to twist and turn your brain.
Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology,PSP,Jul-17-2007,Alfa System,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,Game Chronicles,95,With over 300 quests and level of customization you can do to you character I wouldnt doubt if this game is one of the best RPG’s to hit the market this year.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,Xbox,Mar-9-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Play Magazine,90,With 16 players and 16 guns blazing the game is violent bliss and certainly a war demanding to be fought over and over again. [Apr 2006 p.58]

Redeemer: Enhanced Edition,Xbox One,Jul-19-2019,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,Xbox Tavern,80,Redeemer: Enhanced Edition although not quite as robust as its contemporaries is one hell of a bloody good game. Everything from its progression its pacing and its core functionality right through to its combat diversity and its play depth remains constantly gratifying and energetic throughout. Despite some issues with its performance and its insipid level design fans of the brawler concept will absolutely love what’s on offer here.

Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights,Xbox,Aug-27-2003,THQ,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Next Level Gaming,85,The graphics arent fabulous and the camera angle & constant backtracking tend to be a bit tedious. However the authenticity of Scobby-Doo and the gang of Mystery Inc. makes it worth at least at glance.
Blood Omen 2,PC,Mar-25-2002,Nixxes Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameZone,78,One thing the developers had dead on is the games entire atmosphere.
F1 Championship Season 2000,PlayStation,Sep-30-2000,Visual Sciences,Driving | Racing | Formula One,GameSpot,84,The best-looking and best-sounding PlayStation Formula One title to date and it has excellent gameplay and features to boot.

Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors 2,DS,Nov-20-2005,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Worth Playing,80,Supersonic Warriors 2 is one of those games that at first glance seem not worth bothering with; however once you learn how it works and put it through its paces its extremely satisfying.
Nights of Azure 2: Bride of the New Moon,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Gust,Action | General | Role-Playing | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,90,Nights of Azure 2 is a really lovely game and I don’t really play it for the combat anyway. Rooted in various theatrical styles that give it an aesthetic and tone that I find so appealing it’s not the kind of game that could ever hope to find mainstream acceptance but that’s not unusual for Gust JRPGs. The things that it does well: the characterisation the melodramatic - but not in a pejorative sense - storytelling and the general artfulness of it all are the reasons I played the last one and this new one doesnt disappoint with any of that.
Quantum Break,PC,Apr-5-2016,Remedy Entertainment,Action | General,Gaming Nexus,95,Quantum Break is a great game from start to finish and playing it with all the benefits of being on PC just make it that much better. Given that this game is coming out at a lower price point on PC as well theres just not excuse not to get it.
Nine Parchments,Switch,Dec-5-2017,Frozenbyte | Inc.,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameSpace,85,Nine Parchments is a solid twin-stick isometric Action RPG with some great multiplayer fun. As a single player title it does begin to feel a bit repetitive but this is offset by the exceptionally fun multiplayer. If you own a Switch or PC or other console and are looking for something to scratch that twin-stick shooter itch but with a magical twist Nine Parchments is definitely worth checking out.
Time Crisis: Crisis Zone,PlayStation 2,Oct-19-2004,Namco,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Game Chronicles,84,I am a little bummed the game came with just a Guncon pistol as the arcade unit had a nice little MP5 approximation.
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition,PC,Oct-15-2004,Beenox,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameZone,80,I thought the humor alone was worth the price of admission. Every thing that Harry does or says is over-exaggerated to the point of absurd silliness.
MediEvil: Resurrection,PSP,Sep-13-2005,SCEE,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameZone,87,Really easy to pick up and play. The controls are very easy and responsive. The mini puzzles that are presented to the gamers are easy enough to understand yet still provide a nice challenge.
LEGO Worlds,PlayStation 4,Mar-7-2017,TT Games,Action Adventure | Sandbox,Wccftech,86,LEGO Worlds does an interesting job in standing out from the competition.

BlazeRush,PC,Oct-28-2014,Targem Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Ragequit.gr,85,BlazeRush is one of the most exciting and addictive easy-to-learn/hard-to-master games that you can play especially if you intend to play it with friends.

Black The Fall,PlayStation 4,Jul-11-2017,Sand Sailor Studio,Action | General,Push Square,90,Black The Fall is a special game. The prodigious range of puzzles and platforming mechanics present rival that of a game ten times longer than it and the visual and auditory treat on offer elevates that gameplay to an incredibly high standard. You’ll witness the human race at its very worst through some horrifying imagery but this presents itself as more of a gas to fuel a revolution. Black The Fall is a remarkable experience that will stay with us for a long time and its one that you must not miss out on.
Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell,PC,Jan-20-2015,Volition Inc.,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Open-World,GameOver.gr,80,Its quite short but the over the top action and humour of the franchise will surely pay out.
Nibiru: Age of Secrets,PC,Aug-31-2005,Future Games,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,91,I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery the puzzles and the graphics and felt right at home with much of it. In the same spirit that caused me to love Black Mirror despite its laughable flaws I’m going to have to give Nibiru an A-.
Black Rock Shooter: The Game,PSP,Apr-23-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,88,Looks arent everything though.

Tecmo Bowl: Kickoff,DS,Nov-18-2008,Polygon Magic,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Arcade | Arcade,ZTGD,85,With arcade-like simplistic game play and easy controls Tecmo Bowl: Kickoff gives a nice little alternative to the realism found in that other football title. Now if we could only get an Xbox Live Arcade or PSN version with online leagues life would be grand.
The Sinking City,Xbox One,Jun-25-2019,Frogwares,Action Adventure | Survival,Generación Xbox,85,The ambitious fascinating yet flawed The Sinking City establishes itself as the new Lovecraftian title to look at. A joyful horror theme park that encourages you to fall in love with the gentle touch of the tentacle.
Fallen Legion+,PC,Jan-5-2018,YummyYummyTummy,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Gaming Nexus,80,Fallen Legion+ is a great value for an indie game and it also happens to be a pretty good title to boot. If youre over turn based battles and want something a little more fluid that also looks great then this is a great investment of your time and money.
Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas,Switch,Jun-22-2017,Cornfox & Bros.,Action Adventure | Open-World,GamePro Germany,85,Oceanhorn is a high-quality Zelda clone with great visuals and gameplay definitely worth a sailing trip.
Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer,3DS,Sep-25-2015,Nintendo,Simulation | Virtual | Career,Hobby Consolas,89,The more you play it the more youre surprised. Be aware: if you expect the typical Animal Crossing you may be disappointed. Give it a shot though.

Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,PlayStation 3,Sep-18-2009,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action Adventure | Adventure | Modern | General | General | Modern,DailyGame,80,But for kid-focused entertainment and the knowledge that a movie-based game is actually well executed its hard to top these meatballs.

Crash Tag Team Racing,GameCube,Oct-19-2005,Radical Entertainment,Driving | Car Combat,AceGamez,80,But you cant deny that Crash Bandicoots graphical qualities are one of the best weve seen from a game of this genre.
NASCAR Heat 2,PlayStation 4,Sep-12-2017,Monster Games Inc. | 704Games,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Hardcore Gamer,80,NASCAR Heat 2 offers a lot to do for players. It might feel a bit rushed but it’s extremely addicting and fun. The racing is a consistent experience and Career Mode features aspects that haven’t been seen before. While it may lack the options of true simulation racers the admirable A.I. should make up for that. Top that off with some excellent visuals and a coupon for a real race ticket and Heat 2 continues to trend in the right direction.

This is the Police 2,PC,Jul-31-2018,Weappy Studio,Simulation | Virtual | Career,GameSpace,95,Few stories in games can successfully make me hate the protagonist and at the same time draw me compulsively further into the events and plot twists.

Tannenberg,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2020,M2H,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,PlayStation Universe,80,The modest production values combined with a lack of over-the-top Hollywood bombast will likely ensure that like Verdun before it not everyone will enjoy Tannenberg. For those who can look beyond such flaws however Tannenberg cements itself as a gloriously satisfying strategic shooter that invites players to pit their tactical minds and reflexes in one of the most overlooked theaters of war in a way that no other FPS manages to achieve.
Castaway Paradise,PlayStation 4,Jul-31-2018,Stolen Couch Games,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,PlayStation Universe,85,A charming and quirky simulation game in the spirit of Animal Crossing. Castaway Paradise is the virtual vacation that will end the summer gaming drought.

King Oddball,PlayStation Vita,Feb-4-2014,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action,Gaming Age,83,That said better the developers create a bunch of really enjoyable levels with zero replayability than shoehorning in a three-star system at the expense of fun right? Obviously the ideal would be both but if youre going to make it an either/or thing then I suppose 10tons picked the right option to go with.
Prey the Stars,DS,Oct-13-2008,Koei Canada,Action | General | General,WonderwallWeb,80,This is a very original puzzle action game controls are a bit too complicated to be a classic but it is fun enough to pass the time.

Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death,Xbox 360,Sep-20-2013,ZootFly,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,4Players.de,79,Marlow Briggs is not a new experience nor is it original in any way. But the mix of games like Shadowman Soul Reaver and God of War is well-composed and gives you a decent amount of fun for a reasonable price.
F.E.A.R. Files,Xbox 360,Nov-6-2007,TimeGate Studios | Day 1 Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer 2.0,81,Overall F.E.A.R. might start to be a little dated without an engine overhaul. Additionally Perseus Mandate doesnt introduce anything very new to the series.
Theatre of War,PC,Apr-19-2007,Battlefront.com | 1C | 1C Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic | Tactics,Gaming Target,85,Thinking gamers will appreciate the fact that Theatre of War presents them with a series of tactical problems rather than simply a chance to rack up the body counts. And anyone whos been jaded by the ease of other mainstream RTS franchises will enjoy the fact that this is a game that doesnt coddle its players.
WRC: FIA World Rally Championship,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Gamestyle,80,WRC: World Rally Championship 2 does a bit more to become accessible to new and casual players but in truth it is a game for real fans of the sport those who really want a full on challenge.

Mole Control,PC,Jan-20-2010,Remode,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Logic | Logic,GamingXP,80,The gameplay doesn’t really change during the whole game but it is really entertaining to hunt the moles from time to time. Thanks to the graphics a quite good casual game.

Toki,Switch,Dec-4-2018,Microids,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameOver.gr,80,The return of a classic game that used to eat our coins like crazy back in the late 80s.

Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge,PC,May-5-2006,Spellbound,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Pelit (Finland),89,Desperados 2: Cooper’s Revenge continues on its predecessor’s path. The gameplay graphics and characters are great. Add to that the Morricone-like music and you have a Wild West addict’s dream. Still the game falls short of masterpiece status because of too much frustrating sneaking some graphics bugs and the occasionally stupid AI. [June 2006]
Super Stardust Ultra VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gameplanet,80,The head aiming system works well at least but overall its the definition of unnecessary.
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II,Xbox One,Jul-1-2016,NeocoreGames,Role-Playing | Action RPG,XboxAddict,76,While I struggled with the controls a bit and the change of difficulty was a bit frustrating I was not left disappointed by my return to Borgovia.

Nerf N-Strike,Wii,Oct-28-2008,EA Redwood Shores | EA Salt Lake,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,WonderwallWeb,89,I never expected shooting loads of foam darts would be such fun. NERF could have been a run of the mill on the rails shooter but the inclusion of loads of varied game styles make this a winner for the whole family.
Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3,PlayStation 3,Jun-5-2008,Backbone Emeryville,Action | General | General,1UP,83,Despite the minor flaws I loved most every minute of Wolf of the Battlefield. This is a great game to pop in when youre sitting around with only a few minutes to spare or when a couple of friends are looking for a quick way to kill some time.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space,PlayStation 2,Dec-5-2003,Bandai,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Mech,Cheat Code Central,80,Everything looks and sounds just as good as the animated series that its based on.

Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Operation Resurrection,PlayStation 2,May-30-2003,Raster,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,TotalGames.net,92,Sure some of the textures could do with being of a higher resolution there’s no multiplayer option and… nope that’s pretty much all that’s wrong here.
Superman: Shadow of Apokolips,GameCube,Mar-25-2003,Atari,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cheat Code Central,95,It captures the animated series to a tee and sports the love and care that all of us hope to see heaped on a port that originally appeared on another system (in this case the PS2).
Jet X2O,PlayStation 2,Oct-28-2002,Killer Game,Driving | Racing | Snow / Water,GameReviewer,87,Its been developed so that the more you play it the more you enjoy it. And theres enough depth and unlockables--not to mention a two-player mode--that this one is far less likely to collect dust than any other racers you may have in your collection.

Unsolved Crimes,DS,Sep-30-2008,Now Production,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,GamingXP,83,Unsolved Crimes strikes me as being a really good game because of its consistent story thrilling cut scenes and interesting cases! My own power of deduction intuition and perception are trained. One has the feeling of solving the case on his or her own. A good mixture of being obvious and suspense!
One Piece: Burning Blood,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,Spike Chunsoft,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameGrin,80,A fun game for the fans who want to relive one of the most exciting arcs of the One Piece franchise. Lack of difficulty and appeal to those outside of the fandom and complex mechanics that can be easily forgotten unfortunately limit the player base. However with a variety of game modes that’ll have players coming back for more this is a must play for the fans.
The Last Remnant,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2008,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,WonderwallWeb,90,Initially I would have written The Last Remnant off but thankfully it improves loads once you have given it some time to become one of the best games of its type.

Darius Cozmic Collection: Console,Switch,Jun-16-2020,ININ Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Gaming Age,100,The only small issue is that small screen size can be a factor in handheld mode when playing on the triple and dual-screen arcade releases in pixel-perfect mode. Outside of that this is an absolutely amazing collection of classic shoot ‘em ups that I feel is ultimately worth the higher price tag. I think you’ll agree that the overall quality of this collection is worth it.

H1Z1: Battle Royale,PlayStation 4,Aug-7-2018,Sony Online Entertainment | Daybreak Games,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | First-Person | Third-Person | Tactical | Arcade,TheSixthAxis,80,Solid is the word I would use to describe H1Z1: Battle Royale on PlayStation 4. It’s not the prettiest of games or the most clever but it does what it does really well and it is a great alternative for those who find all the tree chopping and base building in Fortnite very tiresome. H1Z1 is off to a great start on PlayStation 4.
NASCAR Heat Evolution,PlayStation 4,Sep-13-2016,Monster Games Inc. | Dusenberry Martin Racing,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Polygon,75,Give ’em a wreck at the finish and they’ll bring a friend as Richard Lee Petty of Level Cross North Carolina observed 30 years ago in one of the truest things ever said about any sport.

Atari Anthology,PlayStation 2,Nov-22-2004,Digital Eclipse,Miscellaneous | Compilation,GameShark,90,The first console software package to offer these games since they originally appeared on the 2600 so in a way it represents history itself.

Operation Abyss: New Tokyo Legacy,PlayStation Vita,Jun-9-2015,Experience Inc.,Role-Playing | First-Person | Roguelike | Western-Style,Digitally Downloaded,90,Operation Abyss is a thematically unique dungeon crawler with some great systems underpinning it and some of the best level design in the genre to date. And for all that its a real genuine triumph.
Knee Deep,Xbox One,Feb-3-2017,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Adventure | Point-and-Click,GameCritics,85,Knee Deep is clearly an ambitious title working against the constraints that come with being a small studio yet it manages to deliver a darkly humorous southern crime noir that kept me glued to my seat. Sure it has a few problems but my journey through the troubled swamp town of Cyprus Hills was a memorable one.
WRC 6: World Rally Championship,PlayStation 4,Oct-7-2016,Kylotonn,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Critical Hit,80,The sixth time is the charm as WRC 6 finally nails the winning formula for a properly decent rally game that emphasises accessible fun over unforgiving precision. It’s not perfect but it’s easily the best use of the official FIA World Rally Championship in many a year.
S.L.A.I.: Steel Lancer Arena International,PlayStation 2,Sep-21-2005,Genki,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Mech,TotalPlayStation,85,This is an incredibly well-designed mech shooter period.

NeoGeo Battle Coliseum,PlayStation 2,Dec-17-2007,SNK Playmore,Action | Fighting | 2D,GotNext,80,While lacking a bit of the depth and complexity of King of Fighters XI Neogeo Battle Coliseum makes up for it in character variety.
The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,PC,Aug-19-2013,2K Marin,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Tactical | Arcade,Everyeye.it,82,The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is an interesting hybrid between a traditional third-person shooter and a strategic game with elements of role-playing game; but the impression is a game crippled by a troubled production. If you are in search of a different action videogame maybe The Bureau is the game are you searching for.
The Crew 2,PC,Jun-28-2018,Ubisoft Ivory Tower,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,PlayGround.ru,90,An epic racing experience that offers much more content than the original game.

Golem Gates,Switch,May-31-2019,Laser Guided Games | LLC,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Pure Nintendo,85,Overall Golem Gates is a unique take on the card-playing genre and welcome addition to the Switch library. Nonetheless it has some minor flaws even if it remains functionally intact. Either Way Golem Gates is a must try for anyone looking for a strategy game on Switch and/or a fun multiplayer option! I can definitely see this game being something I come back to during airport gameplay sessions or even just when I have a bunch of time to kill.

Fairy Fencer F,PC,Aug-4-2015,Idea Factory,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,80,Fairy Fencer F probably will not gain the same kind of following that the more satirical Hyperdimension games have garnered over the years but it is by all rights a solid effort that manages to surprise in pleasant ways while still providing some familiar mechanics that make the title approachable.
Pac-Man Museum,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Compilation | Compilation,Digitally Downloaded,70,It does not cover everything such as the DX+ version of the Championship edition but what is here is enjoyable.

Unmechanical: Extended Edition,Xbox One,Jan-30-2015,Grip Games,Action | Puzzle | General | Platformer | 2D,Gamestyle,80,Overall Unmechanical Extended is a lovely way to spend a few hours lost in a silent world taxing those brain cells with an adorable main character too.
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers,Wii,Dec-26-2009,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,RPG Fan,88,In the end The Crystal Bearers manages to be a somewhat simple but entertaining adventure but one that is polished and put together with care for the sole purpose of entertaining the player.
Frogger Helmet Chaos,PSP,Sep-29-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,AceGamez,90,Although not all of the DSs features are utilised (mainly the touch screen) the challenging gameplay and DS download function more than make up for this.

Super Trucks Racing,PlayStation 2,Oct-29-2003,Jester Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Yahoo!,80,A refreshing breeze of fresh oily air in a stale market full of near identical racing games and if you give it a try it’s likely you’ll be very pleasantly surprised.
Freaky Flyers,PlayStation 2,Aug-5-2003,Midway Studios - San Diego,Driving | Racing | Kart,GamePro,80,The two-player mode isn’t all bad but for such a solid game it’s a flaw that’s keeping this otherwise plenary racing game below the ranks of Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing.
Auto Modellista,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2003,Capcom,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Gamezilla!,92,This game has great controls but they’re touchy.
UFC: Tapout 2,Xbox,Mar-20-2003,DreamFactory,Action | Fighting | 3D,GamePro,80,The most impressive feature in Tapout 2 is the redesigned visuals. Dream Factory chose to completely redo the graphics to make them look more life-like and as authentic as the real deal.
Disaster Report,PlayStation 2,Feb-15-2003,Irem,Action Adventure | Modern,GameCritics,90,Add to that some late-game plot twists several path-altering choices a wide variety of obstacles to overcome multiple endings to discover and a wealth of small touches (like your characters clothing deteriorating with each narrow escape) and youve got a progressively energetic game set in a fantastic locale: one step beyond everyday life.
Defender,GameCube,Nov-3-2002,Inevitable Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendojo,93,Defender is all about defense which may be a major turn-off for many gamers out there.

Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers,Switch,May-26-2017,Capcom,Action | Fighting | 2D,Game Over Online,90,Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers delivers a lot of fun even if the overall package could stand to have some room for improvement. The Way of the Hado mode is mere filler but the core game is an absolute blast. Using either the original or revamped art works well and you can alternate between each style along with changing the music from the original to remixes before a full gameplay session. Controlling it with the regular JoyCon setup on either the tablet or the grip works shockingly well – even though the split d-pad is far from ideal. Using the left stick feels natural and you don’t need to rush out and buy a Pro controller to enjoy the full experience.
Ragnarok Odyssey,PlayStation Vita,Oct-30-2012,Game Arts,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Destructoid,90,For all its missteps as an action-RPG it is simply flawless as an example of how to make a Vita experience work. Judicious use of touchscreen controls beautiful visuals a smartly broken-up mission structure and eerily swift loading times makes this the gold standard for Sonys portable.
Neopets Petpet Adventures: The Wand of Wishing,PSP,Mar-14-2006,SCEA,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,BonusStage,79,Sony has a great potential franchise here if they continue to polish and refine the gameplay and visuals with each installment and I’d recommend they take this style of top-down action to the home consoles as well adding even more features.

NFL Head Coach,PlayStation 2,Jun-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Management,Digital Entertainment News,81,It’s not perfect it’s not available on next-gen systems but for control freaks it may be the most exhaustively complete sports SIM ever released on a console.
Hidden Agenda,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Supermassive Games,Miscellaneous | Party / Minigame,Gaming Age,91,As I said up top there are certainly reasons to be wary of Hidden Agenda. It’s hard not to search a crime scene for clues with your unresponsive PlayLink app and come away wishing that you were just using a plain controller. But that’s more than outweighed by the fact that the game also does a better job of capturing what makes mystery novels so compelling than nearly anything else I’ve ever played. Hidden Agenda may not be perfect but it knows how to keep you hooked right to the very end.
Dragon Age II: Legacy,PC,Jul-26-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Action RPG,PC PowerPlay,90,A surprisingly detailed add-in for this controversially received sequel. New approaches to encounter design and smarter enemies stand out although story remains a strong feature.
Tak: The Great Juju Challenge,DS,Sep-19-2005,Altron,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,BonusStage,77,These mini games were definitely needed too as the story mode itself is exceptionally short clocking in at maybe three hours tops. Equally disappointing there’s no wireless multiplayer of any sort.
Final Fantasy Type-0 HD,PC,Aug-18-2015,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG,RPG Fan,85,A solid porting effort though one that shows Square Enix still has a little ways to go.
Dragon Age: Origins - Return to Ostagar,PC,Jan-13-2010,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,CPUGamer,90,The existence of a big-budget very traditional computer role-playing game (CRPG) alone makes Dragon Age: Origins a huge accomplishment.
Donkey Konga 2,GameCube,May-9-2005,Namco,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,TotalGames.net,92,Menus arent quite so easy to navigate as they were previously but then thats only because theres so much more to do now and as trade-offs go this is one were quite happy to abide. [JPN Import]

Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star,Switch,Jul-25-2017,Marvelous Inc.,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Worth Playing,80,In the end Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star serves as a good appetizer for those who want some Musou action now. The action goes at an almost non-stop clip and theres rarely any time to breathe before you have to unleash triple-number combos again and again. Theres a ton of content to go over and while the story can be nonsensical at times it remains entertaining for those who arent averse to anime or a visual novel style of game. Overall Fate/Extella is a solid game to bide your time with while you await some of the bigger titles this year.
Crimsonland,Xbox One,Oct-14-2015,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,ZTGD,90,Crimsonland is now up there with Super Stardust HD as one of my favourite twin-stick shooters. It may not blow you away with the visuals but looks certainly don’t matter when it’s packing this much content. Added to the fact that the Xbox One version includes new content this is a must buy for fans of the genre and for those looking for a fun co-op experience.
Battle Princess of Arcadias,PlayStation 3,Jun-17-2014,ApolloSoft,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PSX Extreme,84,Battle Princess of Arcadias is a lot of things at once an action side scroller a JRPG and a strategy game. Mostly its just a great game made of simple familiar parts.
AO Tennis 2,Xbox One,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,TheSixthAxis,80,AO Tennis 2 is a bright likeable tennis sim with bags of room to grow and as it stands is easily the best tennis game of this generation.
Nintendo Labo: Toycon 03 Vehicle Kit,Switch,Sep-14-2018,Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Party / Minigame,NintendoWorldReport,90,While the Variety Kit did provide some entertainment I felt that the replayability of that initial Labo came up short which led to my reduced enthusiasm in the product line. If you had a similar feeling to what I did don’t let that previous experience prevent you from trying out this new offering. Whether Nintendo learned some lessons during the first run or if the extra time in development allowed them to release a more polished experience I’m not sure. But what I do know is that the Labo Vehicle Kit is miles ahead of its predecessors and has made me excited again about the future of this franchise.

DreamWorks Shrek SuperSlam,PC,Nov-1-2005,Shaba Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Fighting | 2D | 3D,PGNx Media,83,The game’s combat system is fundamentally solid with an excellent combo system that is actually much more in-depth than I originally suspected.
Octodad: Dadliest Catch,PlayStation 4,Apr-22-2014,Kevin Zuhn,Modern | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person | Modern,Digitally Downloaded,90,Even when the overall challenge of living a day in Octodad’s shoes bears too much weight the game is amusing enough to quell most of the frustration.
Magicka: Wizard Wars,PC,May-27-2014,Paradox North,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General,Hooked Gamers,80,Magicka: Wizard Wars definitely struggles a bit with its steep learning curve and some serious bugs that need to be addressed but the quick energetic games are largely worth the struggles.

The Bunker,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Splendy Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,GameCritics,80,Although I hate to be so vague about The Bunker giving away too much would be doing a great disservice to anyone reading this review.

Pathologic 2,PC,May-28-2019,Ice-Pick Lodge | tinyBuild,Action Adventure | Survival,GameCritics,95,Pathologic 2 is a harsh unwelcoming experience that took a lot out of me but everything in it no matter how odd or seemingly inconsequential is setup for an eventual payoff. Players capable of embracing its dour atmosphere will be rewarded with one of gaming’s greatest narrative accomplishments — it’s an epic-length refutation of the idea that gratification can only come through success that stories need to be about heroes that fun is the only metric by which a game’s quality can be measured.

Golf: Tee It Up!,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2008,Housemarque,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,GamePro,90,Golf: Tee It Up! loses points for its minimalist approach (only 2 courses and limited character customization doesnt help) but because it still has a full-game-for-the-price-of-an-arcade-game feel attractive visuals and holds the promise of more downloadable content in the future its a great value.

That thorough exploration of death ties into every aspect of the game from its hack and slash gameplay to the ending choice that will leave players reflecting upon the journey they just went on. It isn’t often that a game truly succeeds as art but every part of Oninaki goes back into its core motif and that’s why it is an essential action RPG.

FreeStyle Street Basketball,PC,May-15-2007,JC Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade | Arcade,AtomicGamer,78,Overall Freestyle Street Basketball has the potential to be a neat game. The idea is solid the graphics and overall style are neat and the gameplay is pretty fun. However the horrible players you have to get through to eventually play with the decent ones will turn people away and the lag will push even more away.
The Simpsons Game,DS,Oct-30-2007,Griptonite Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Thunderbolt,80,The Simpsons Game for the DS may not be innovative nor appealing to worldwide mainstream audiences - you really do need to be a fan of the show to appreciate what’s been done here – but it’s a highly creative production nonetheless.
The Occupation,Xbox One,Mar-5-2019,White Paper Games,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Xbox Tavern,84,The Occupation’s compelling story sits rather well with its intelligent framework. This is for the most part an intriguing real-time detective game that sports some solid features and robust mechanics collectively putting forward a tense and constantly exciting affair. Indeed there’s a few persistent technical flaws present that tend to interfere with the game’s flow but in the face of everything that The Occupation gets right they’re easy to overlook.
Tannenberg,PC,Feb-13-2019,Blackmill Games,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Shooter | First-Person | General | Tactical,Hooked Gamers,85,Tannenberg takes what made Verdun fun and improves upon what made it awesome. The new environments in particular really make the potential of a WWI FPS/Simulator really stand out and stick with memorable moments that last long after a match is over. The developers proved themselves with their support of Verdun over time which gives me reason to believe that Tannenberg is only going to get better from here.
Earth Defense Force 2025,PlayStation 3,Feb-18-2014,Sandlot,Shooter | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Age,91,Its a game thats never about anything more than having a blast (and of course blowing up bugs space robots and buildings) — what more could anyone want?
AO Tennis 2,PlayStation 4,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,Player 2,75,AO Tennis 2 is a deep and rewarding simulation that offers much for the hardcore tennis fan. An initial difficulty wall will likely put a few players off but for those that persist there is a rewarding and deep game of tennis to be found.
SIMULACRA 2,PC,Jan-30-2020,Kaigan Games OU | Kaigan Games,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,TheGamer,80,Simulacra 2 is at its best when it is rewarding strong attention to detail and at its worst when its punishing you for guessing incorrectly in dialogue sequences. The acting is strong by FMV standards too. I like this series and I appreciate how much it grew between the two games. Im excited to see where they go next with it.
Blacksad: Under the Skin,Xbox One,Nov-5-2019,Pendulo Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Xbox Tavern,81,Blacksad: Under The Skin is an enjoyable detective game and the gritty noir story is very gripping. You care what happens to your cat-man detective and you’ll want to get to the bottom of the crime. All the other characters in the game are interesting and varied and the fact they are animals makes things a bit more entertaining. But the controls when moving Blacksad are so slow and clunky that they let the game down a tad ruining the will to explore the world fully.
Q.U.B.E. 2,Switch,Feb-21-2019,Toxic Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,The Indie Game Website,80,The story is of an archaeologist stranding on an alien planet who must… solve puzzles to escape? Plot and writing are not Q.U.B.E. 2’s strong points lying deep in Portal’s shadow but on gameplay terms this stands alone as a very gratifying experience that comes recommended.
Football Manager Handheld 2010,PSP,Dec-22-2009,Sports Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Management | Management,Vandal,85,The series keeps its excellent level and allows the most complete and realistic experience to date.
Chaos League: Sudden Death,PC,Dec-8-2005,Cyanide,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General,IncGamers,75,If there’s a redeeming factor to the game it’s that it’s a bargain at £19.99 considering you get the original Chaos League too. If you like your sports games with a touch of evil and a pinch of sadism then you’ll definitely want to check it out.
Madagascar,PlayStation 2,May-23-2005,Toys for Bob,Action | Platformer | 3D,PGNx Media,85,Undoubtedly a fun little platformer. The game boasts respectable gameplay and an impressive audio-visual combination as well as a comical plot from the folks at Dreamworks. There’s plenty to do in the levels and plenty to unlock for a second play through.
Swarm,Xbox 360,Mar-23-2011,Hothead Games,Miscellaneous | General | General,IGN,85,When you combine engaging and unique gameplay with Swarms pleasant (but dark) aesthetics and whimsical nature what you have is a great downloadable game.
Resident Evil 6,PC,Mar-22-2013,Capcom | QLOC,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,ZTGD,85,Fans looking to scratch the survival horror itch will likely still not come away impressed by the direction the series has taken. Resident Evil has become more of an action-horror game; a change I have welcomed with open arms.
Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers,PC,Jun-15-2010,Stainless Games,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,PC Format,81,A decent game. [Sept 2010 p.105]
Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter,Xbox 360,Jan-13-2010,Croteam,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,MS Xbox World,85,Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter for the Xbox 360 is a return of a classic. It may seem a little dated by some but I personally believe that for both newcomers and nostalgic gamers like myself the HD remake that is now available still provides a wonderful experience in terms of both speed and adrenaline pumping action.
Kirby's Blowout Blast,3DS,Jul-6-2017,Nintendo | HAL Labs,Action | General,Vooks,100,Kirby’s Blowout Blast is easily my favourite of the mini games released on the 3DS due to how much more depth is has compared to the others. You’re getting around 5-6 hours of play from your $10 purchase making it a good way to tide you over until Kirby returns later this year on the 3DS and Switch in 2018.
NHL 2K10,Xbox 360,Sep-15-2009,Take-Two Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,WonderwallWeb,90,If you love hockey you will love this its one of the best around.
Order of War,PC,Sep-22-2009,Wargaming.net,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic | Tactics,1UP,83,While it does have a few shortcomings (mostly in the pacing) Wargaming.net really has a lot to build on with Order of War and I would be thrilled to see a follow up -- perhaps even one taking place in the Pacific Theatre.
NASCAR Heat 5,Xbox One,Jul-7-2020,704Games,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,MondoXbox,80,NASCAR Heat 5 improves on the previous and successful episode adding new features and modes coupled with very well balanced difficulty modes. Its still got lot to improve in the presentation area and in the multiplayer modes too similar to the ones in previous game but while waiting for the next-gen jump this remains a very good NASCAR experience.
Dead or Alive 5 Last Round,Xbox One,Feb-17-2015,Team Ninja,Action | Fighting | 3D,IGN Spain,84,Once again almost the same game that we saw a couple of years ago but its still a worthy game for the new gen consoles that doesnt have a lot of quality fighting games available. Beautiful and smooth but a little bit aged.
Foul Play,Xbox 360,Sep-18-2013,Mediatonic,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,LevelUp,85,Foul Play runs under the premise of being an action filled theater play so youll have to keep your audience entertained at all times. The level and character design helps maintain this illusion and even though youll see the actors faces beneath the monsters costumes the cheering of the crowd will be enough motivation to don your monocle and kick some demonic butt.
Bejeweled 2 Deluxe,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,PopCap,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Matching,WHAM! Gaming,78,There are several game modes all of which are quite fun and challenging – as long as you can stop yourself from using unlimited hints in the Puzzle Mode.
The Crew 2,Xbox One,Jun-26-2018,Ubisoft Ivory Tower,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,TheXboxHub,90,In all The Crew 2 is a big step forward for the series and does its best to right the wrongs of the original. Take the time to learn the ins and outs here and you will have a game that gives you hours and hours of enjoyment.
Akimi Village,PlayStation 3,Jun-15-2011,NinjaBee,Miscellaneous | General | General,Worth Playing,85,While Xbox 360 veterans may find this to be a very similar experience in a different skin PS3 owners will be very receptive to this game especially since theyve already been the recipients of some experimental titles. Its an experience worth playing but we hope that the next iteration will include some form of multiplayer.
Ancients of Ooga,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2010,NinjaBee | Bacon Wrapped Games,Action | General | General,Eurogamer,80,With its twisted humour and mutated style lending a pleasantly Oddworld vibe to proceedings this is a crafted effort for those of us with a tendency to mutter that they dont make em like they used to. Apparently they do.
Need for Speed: Nitro,Wii,Nov-2-2009,EA Montreal,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GamePro,80,Something else that blindsided me was the killer sense of speed. Dropping behind the wheel of a Charger or Cobra for a quick race was immediately satisfying and while NITRO definitely suffers from low-res car models and building textures that doesnt stop the game from feeling frighteningly fast.
Fire Emblem Warriors,3DS,Oct-20-2017,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Areajugones,80,Fire Emblem Warriors is one of the best designed musou games of the recent years thanks to its strategy touch which is great for this genre. If you are thinking about buying this version of the game go ahead if you don’t own a Nintendo Switch because you will not be disappointed.
Def Jam: Icon,Xbox 360,Mar-6-2007,EA Chicago,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,XboxAddict,94,The game’s music system puts game audio in a brand new light making it an integral part of the action. The whole game seems to course in line with the music in a synergy that hasn’t been done but definitely should be replicated.
Pariah,PC,May-3-2005,Digital Extremes,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Total Video Games,90,In introducing weapon modification and more importantly Adrenaline/Healing Tool Pariah ends up feeling significantly different to the vast majority of shooters on the market there’s a definite sense of survival to the whole experience.
Mad Max,PlayStation 4,Sep-1-2015,Avalanche Studios,General | Action | Action Adventure | General | Open-World,ZTGD,90,Mad Max the game isn’t only a fantastic time it’s a great addition to the franchise and one of the few games that completely destroys the expectations that a movie based game has to be bad.
Shenmue III,PC,Nov-19-2019,Ys Net,Action Adventure | Open-World,Riot Pixels,84,If the original dilogy is Iliad Shenmue 3 is Odyssey a sequel that even exceeds expectations in some regards.
Valhalla Hills,PC,Dec-2-2015,Daedalic Entertainment,Strategy | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),80,A must-have for building-strategy fans offers - despite of seeming lack of content - dozens of hours of entertainment. And there are Vikings! [Issue #259]
Scaler,Xbox,Oct-20-2004,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamezilla!,91,The surprising thing about Scaler is the game is just plain fun to play. The gameplay is robust with reasonably challenging puzzles to solve the control system is enjoyable as Scaler is easy to move and smooth and the story is humorous with a solid plot.
Capcom Arcade Cabinet,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2013,M2,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Gaming Age,83,Capcom Arcade Cabinet is a fine example of a true classic collection. The DLC packs and a few strange games may scare some away from getting this one.
The Eye of Judgment: Legends,PSP,Mar-10-2010,SCEI,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,PSFocus,81,The first The Eye of Judgment was a unique game. The PlayStation Portable version is the one without a camera but with the same elements. The unique aspect is lost but the strategy gameplay is still very good. Only the story in this game is a bit boring and the gameplay isn’t for anyone.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,GameCube,Nov-8-2005,Electronic Arts,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Nintendo Power,85,A great leap forward for the Potter franchise and a fun and inclusive gaming experience. [Jan 2006 p.107]
Hey! Pikmin,3DS,Jul-28-2017,Nintendo | Arzest,Action | Platformer | 2D,Digital Chumps,90,As my first Pikmin experience I really enjoyed Hey! Pikmin for a variety of reasons and found little wrong with it. Whether you have played a Pikmin game before or not or are just looking for a fun game that’s not too easy and certainly not too hard give this one a go. I believe a demo is still available from the eShop at the time of this writing as well.
Rayman 3 HD,Xbox 360,Mar-21-2012,Ubisoft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Game Chronicles,82,Rayman 3 HD is a great remake of an amazing classic but it would have been nice if they could have updated the controls and camera to be just as good as the new graphics.
ChromaGun,Switch,Jan-22-2018,Pixel Maniacs,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Switch Player,80,ChromaGun successfully utilises colour in unique and creative ways to provide an engaging experience that puzzle aficionados will relish. It could be a bit longer but as it is its a very strong puzzle shooter.
Oblitus,PC,Feb-27-2015,Connor Ullmann,Action | Platformer | 2D,Twinfinite,100,Oblitus puts a whole lot of content into a small tightly-made package. The overall aesthetic and backing music are great and the constant threat of death taking all of your accomplishments away drives play very well.
Poker Night 2,Xbox 360,Apr-24-2013,Telltale Games,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Cheat Code Central,84,Very few games are stuffed with this much personality. If you like humorous video games at all (and especially if you like Borderlands and Portal) you really need to play this. It actually makes you feel like you’re sitting in a room and hanging out with some of gaming’s favorite stars and that’s an opportunity you shouldn’t pass up unless you simply hate video games.
Ghosthunter,PlayStation 2,Aug-17-2004,SCE Studio Cambridge,Action Adventure | Horror,Cheat Code Central,90,The gameplay can become a bit a redundant and you wont find much for replay value but Ghosthunter is certainly one of the best rental choices of the year.
Foul Play,PC,Sep-18-2013,Mediatonic,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Nexus,90,With its great sense of humor exciting narrative cool art style and fun stage play antics you would think that Foul Play would be at the top of everybodys must-buy list.
Real Boxing,PlayStation Vita,Sep-17-2013,Vivid Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,TheSixthAxis,80,It may not be anything ground-breaking but I feel the title should be regarded as one of the Vita’s best games yet. With vastly improved visuals animations and control schemes over the mobile version Real Boxing on the Vita is surely the best version of the game to get.
Final Fantasy IV: The After Years,Wii,Jun-1-2009,Matrix Software,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,RPG Fan,90,Final Fantasy IV: The After Years is not only a very respectful treatment of the original it also makes me want to dust off my SNES and relive my innocent childhood love of games.
Gallop Racer 2006,PlayStation 2,May-2-2006,Tecmo,Sports | Alternative | Horse Racing,GamingTrend,88,This is not a title to sit down and play five minutes worth before you run out for errands. But if you devote some time to learning about horses and the racing itself Gallop Racer 2006 is surprisingly rewarding.
Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII,Xbox 360,Feb-11-2014,Square Enix,General | Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,MondoXbox,85,Never boring and full of brilliant open environments Lightning Returns tells a great story coupled with a new and very effective combat system. Square Enix could have done something more on the technical side but the great artistic design manages to make us turn a blind eye on some of the problems.
Need for Speed: Shift,PSP,Sep-15-2009,EA Bright Light,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,90,If its fast-paced racing you crave and you dont care about adjusting every nut and bolt on your car then Shift is an excellent game that exceeds expectations in all areas.
Tron 2.0: Killer App,Xbox,Nov-4-2004,Climax Group,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,XboxAddict,96,A shooter which genuinely does stand out from the crowd with distinction  not an easy accomplishment for a genre which is flooded with clones and has-beens.
Forsaken World,PC,Mar-22-2011,Perfect World Entertainment,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,GamingXP,86,The vibrant community is what makes the difference Forsaken World is simply not forsaken. The key points for a MMO are available right away: Cool graphics lots of players and even more details.
Lips: Party Classics,Xbox 360,Mar-2-2010,iNiS,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,RealGamer,80,Lips: Party Classics doesn’t really do anything to expand the series in any way but unlike most music games features a track list which is probably one of the best to grace such a game of course it’s all down to taste but with something on offer to cover most players music choice the game should prove to be a hit at any party.
Disney's Chicken Little: Ace in Action,PlayStation 2,Nov-9-2006,Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,75,Theyre all solid and theyre all fun with just the perfect difficulty curve for the younger set while featuring enough challenge and mass destruction to keep parents interests. [Jan. 2007 p.89]
Mario Party 5,GameCube,Nov-10-2003,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Party,Nintendophiles,95,Adds a few nice modes to the Mario Party series but if you already own Mario Party 4 there is absolutely no reason to upgrade.
SWAT: Global Strike Team,Xbox,Oct-29-2003,Argonaut Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Next Level Gaming,89,The most important thing is that SWAT: Global Strike Team is just a damn fun game to play. I must say that I am a little disappointed about not being able to play online but the extra downloadable content through Xbox Live does help ease the pain.
Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup,Xbox,Oct-28-2003,Electronic Arts,Sports | Alternative | Other,GameBiz,82,Unfortunately it can grow a little bit repetitive and is a bit too easy.
Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights,PlayStation 2,May-20-2002,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Electric Playground,90,I think I keep saying this but Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights is fun. And thats about what all these words youve just read amount to.
1nsane,PC,Feb-5-2001,Invictus,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Games Radar,100,Listen: Insane works. It works because its multiplayer it works because its simple and it works because its fun. Youd do well to remember that but you wont because youre so desperate to replay the cliched gaming youve already experienced on your thousand-pound calculator. Stupid. All the best...
Oni,PlayStation 2,Jan-29-2001,Rockstar Toronto,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Daily Radar,88,Theres refreshingly little emphasis on lever pulling or jumping puzzles -- someone out there is listening.
Quake III: Team Arena,PC,Dec-18-2000,id Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Armchair Empire,92,A great add-on for fans of the Quake series and multiplayer mayhem. This is a must have for the frag fanatic.
Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror,PC,Oct-31-1997,Revolution Software,Adventure | Third-Person | Point-and-Click | Modern | Modern,Gaming Age,83,The sound is another area in which The Smoking Mirror excels. Although there isnt a constant soundtrack playing haunting music often accompanies certain actions much like the original Tomb Raider.
Runespell: Overture,PC,Jul-20-2011,Mystic Box,Role-Playing | General | General,Cheat Code Central,82,The only real complaint I have-besides the non-scrolling map mentioned earlier-is that the game has no multiplayer mode.
Ivy the Kiwi?,DS,Aug-24-2010,Prope,Action | General | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Nintendo Life,90,Ivy the Kiwi is the perfect example of the type of enjoyable and refreshing gaming experience that can be created when a developer isnt afraid to try something a little different.
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,Xbox,Mar-23-2006,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII,TeamXbox,83,The Follow Camera turns a decent game into a great game. Deeper multiplayer support would have been nice to drive home the next-gen quotient.
Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020,Switch,Nov-5-2019,Sega,Sports | Individual | Athletics,GameSpace,90,The amount of events is just right to get the most fun for your money.
Thrillville,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Frontier Developments,Strategy | General,GamingTrend,87,If youre looking for a fun game that you can play with the kids or as a group this is a solid purchase and does its job quite well.
Turok,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2008,Propaganda Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Play Magazine,90,Even with a weak script Turoks flexible play mechanics strong level designs and high production values make the story mode alone worth the price of admission. [Jan 2008 p.49]
Resident Evil 0: HD Remaster,Xbox One,Jan-19-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,Gamers' Temple,85,Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster is easily the most unique of the old-school RE games and one that should be experienced if youre a fan of the series.
My Memory of Us,Xbox One,Oct-10-2018,Juggler Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,XBLA Fans,100,The game’s presentation is like a kid’s book that came to life and you get to control the heroes which is a stark contract in some ways to the deep nature of the plot. The story is based as a loose allegory for World War II. They obviously made a lot of changes such as the robotic enemies; however they handled an incredibly complex and dark theme well. I am very glad I got the opportunity to experience it. I had no clue what the game was when I fired it up on my Xbox. It was a pleasant surprise and I hope more people get the chance to play and appreciate this work of art.
Farming Simulator 17,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2016,Maximum Games,Simulation | Virtual | Career,Multiplayer.it,83,This is simply the best chapter of the series.
I Am Alive,Xbox 360,Mar-7-2012,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Guardian,100,I Am Alive uses its post-apocalyptic environment far more effectively than many other games that share its nightmare vision of the future. I Am Alive joins games such as Fallout RAGE and Left 4 Dead in its setting where a some horrendous event put paid to civilisation as we know it but in truth its far closer in its atmosphere and aesthetic values to Cormac MacCarthys grim post-apocalyptic novel The Road.
Conan,Xbox 360,Oct-23-2007,Nihilistic,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Play.tm,85,An absolutely storming adventure and I will definitely recommend it to any fans of the genre; it has been one of the most enjoyable titles of its type that I have played in a long time. There are a few flaws that stop it from being truly great but it does what it sets out to do - provide a few hours of happy blood-lust carving a path of destruction through hordes of enemies.
The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,PlayStation 3,Aug-20-2013,2K Marin,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Tactical | Sci-Fi | Arcade,LaPS4,81,This adventurous title from 2K Marin is a very good example of a tactical shooter game.

World of Warplanes,PC,Jul-2-2013,Wargaming.net | Persha Studia,Action | Simulation | Shooter | Flight | Shooter | Combat | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,XGN,90,Like an insane stunt pilot in the Red Bull Air Race World of Warplanes manages to leave an excellent impression. But Wargaming has to keep proving themselves in the future if they want us to remain impressed. Its easy to find great satisfaction however when you roam the games skies with Ride of the Valkyries on the background while youre bringing death and destruction in your own personal aircraft.
The Matrix: Path of Neo,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2005,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Stuff,95,Shockingly enough is actually pretty damn good. Sure it looks uglier than Ernest Borgnine in a tutu and trying to use the controls is like operating the Space Shuttle while wearing oven mitts but once you get the hang of it beating the Stove Top stuffing out of agents is terrific fun.
Phantasy Star Portable 2,PSP,Sep-13-2010,Alfa System,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Gamers' Temple,84,Basically if youve enjoyed this type of RPG before and have the time to get into a new one Phantasy Star Portable 2 is pretty much a must-buy.
Jack Keane,PC,Apr-15-2008,Legacy Interactive,Adventure | General | General,AceGamez,90,Jack Keane is the most enjoyable point-and-click adventure Ive played in a long time. It will appeal to almost every adventure fan as the puzzles gradually get harder while the game successfully reproduces the vibrant humorous and slick atmosphere and antics of beloved classics of this proud genre like Sam & Max and Monkey Island.
Arslan: The Warriors of Legend,PlayStation 4,Feb-9-2016,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Digitally Downloaded,90,In most other regards Arslan is a fairly standard Warriors experience but between the strong epic narrative gorgeous setting and the varied bunch of really enjoyable characters there is more than enough here to justify its place among Koei Tecmo’s growing stable of licensed work.
Silent Line: Armored Core,PlayStation 2,Jul-17-2003,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Mech,Gamestyle,100,An utterly superb game.
Football Manager 2019 Touch,Switch,Dec-6-2018,Sega,Sports | Team | Soccer | Management,GameSpew,90,Football Manager 2019 Touch is so much more than its iOS/Android namesake; it’s the beautiful game made even more beautiful. It’s the definitive option for any diehard Football Manager fan or football fan looking to take their passion on the go.
Megaquarium,PC,Sep-13-2018,Twice Circled,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,PC Gamer,86,A charming watery theme park management game where fish are friends not food. Until they eat each other or you forget to feed them.
FOX n FORESTS,PC,May-17-2018,Bonus Level Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hardcore Gamer,80,The core platforming and action-oriented combat work well as does the seasonal shifting mechanic. There’s a natural flow to the levels and exploration is rewarded — resulting in stages that are usually fun to play through again. The RPG mechanics are a bit too girnd-heavy for a platformer but allow you to extend your skills beyond most games in the genre while the rich graphics and robust sound deliver a satisfying experience for the eyes and ears.
.hack//G.U. Last Recode,PC,Nov-3-2017,CyberConnect2,Miscellaneous | Compilation,ZTGD,85,The release of .hack//G.U. Last Recode is a celebration of what I consider to be CyberConnect2’s greatest achievement in gaming thus far. It’s an excellent way for newcomers to experience one of the most underrated JRPGs in the lengthy and excellent catalogue of PS2 games. As for those like myself who loved the original- a chance to say hello to some old friends and finally erase that last bit of regret that’s been lingering all these years.
The Legend of Kusakari,3DS,Aug-25-2016,Librage,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,80,There’s a clever mix of addictiveness with basic gameplay to keep players going without getting them too irritated about the more difficult levels. Ultimately the experience of playing this mirrors Shiba Kari himself - the game will never be as notable as the heroes that exist in its world but humble as it is there is a real sense of satisfaction in clearing that field of long grass.
Mario Super Sluggers,Wii,Aug-25-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Arcade | Arcade,Games Master UK,80,A step back for Wii baseball controls but enough of a gameplay leap to warrant playing. [Sept 2008 p.70]

Moons of Madness,PC,Oct-22-2019,Rock Pocket Games,Action Adventure | Survival,Ragequit.gr,83,Moons of Madness may be the best implementation of traditional puzzle-solving weve seen so far in an interactive narrative experience in a setting that skillfully merges unearthly horrors with more tangible science fiction.
Brain Age: Concentration Training,3DS,Feb-10-2013,Nintendo,Edutainment | Miscellaneous | Edutainment,Gaming Nexus,85,While I did enjoy Brain Age: Concentration Training and still train every day with it there are some aspects I didn’t enjoy. Some of the Devilish Trainings can be just downright tedious and off-putting at times while the game’s handwriting recognition could use a bit of work. However if you can train enough days to unlock some of the other types of training it can still be a fun experience.
Duel Masters: Sempai Legends,Game Boy Advance,Jun-1-2004,Mistic Software,Miscellaneous | Card Battle,Into Liquid Sky,83,I understand the need to simplify things for use on the GBA but even the fact that all the spells use the same art seems a bit disappointing. With that said though the graphics do what they should - carry the solid gameplay through.
LEGO Worlds,Xbox One,Mar-7-2017,TT Games,Action Adventure | Sandbox,TheXboxHub,80,LEGO Worlds may not be built on the mighty foundation of survival and building but the content in place is certainly a welcome addition. Whilst the quests could certainly do with a little more inspiration it will be the infinite Master Builder possibilities with the many thousands of LEGO bricks available that you’ll be remembering this classic for.
Game of Thrones: Episode Two - The Lost Lords,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2015,Telltale Games,Action | Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,CGMagazine,90,Telltale has created [a] well-written instalment of the Game of Thrones game that will please fans of the show and stands on its own as a tense dramatic tale of intrigue politics and what families do to survive.
Warframe,PC,Mar-25-2013,Digital Extremes,General | Shooter | Sci-Fi | General | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,The Overpowered Noobs,80,Play Warframe. Play it for more than a few hours preferably with friends and keep an open mind into doing some third-party research to straighten out some of these systems. Warframe takes so much of what makes ARPG’s addictive and rounds it out with more polish and depth than most its competitors on the current games market. If the hooks aren’t deeply embedded by then maybe something this in-depth isn’t for you.
Quake Arena Arcade,Xbox 360,Dec-15-2010,id Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamingXP,87,The trip to Vietnam leaves us with mixed feelings. On the one hand the add-on keeps the high standard of the main game but on the other hand there are not many new things. Despite the few vehicles and minor changes in the weapon section there isnt much new to discover.
Overland,PC,Sep-19-2019,Finji,Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,Vandal,82,Overland proves once again the talent of the team behind it with a challenging and original adventure that relies on a solid turn-based strategy and survival-oriented gameplay.

State of Decay 2,PC,May-22-2018,Undead Labs,Action Adventure | Open-World,Quarter to Three,100,Besides polish is overrated. Consider Dawn of the Dead. Both of them. Zack Justice League Snyder’s update is polished contemporary and appropriately dumb. But Romero’s original is raw uneven and still powerful. They each have their place but only one of them is timeless. If you want the fullest and most thorough expression of zombie mythology in a movie you watch Romero’s Dawn of the Dead. If you want the fullest and most thorough expression of zombie mythology in a game you play Undead Labs’ State of Decay 2.
Thunder Wolves,PC,May-15-2013,Most Wanted Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Gaming Nexus,85,Thunder Wolves is a great shoot em up with a hint of tactical finesse required now and then. It certainly packs quite a bit of bang for your bucks. Grab another controller and a good friend to have even more fun in the co-op multiplayer mode.
Frogger: Helmet Chaos,DS,Sep-27-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,WHAM! Gaming,90,Its a treat to play something so fresh and yet so (often frustratingly) familiar. Helmet Chaos strikes the perfect balance between its 20th Century lineage and gameplay for today.
Call of Duty 3,Wii,Nov-14-2006,Exakt,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PGNx Media,93,Call of Duty 3 is a great showcase for the Wii’s unique control scheme. While the Wii controls work with other games of the games we’ve played so far Call of Duty 3 is the one that most benefits from the motion sensing controls.
Dragon Marked For Death,Switch,Mar-26-2019,Inti Creates,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Nintendo Enthusiast,90,Dragon Marked for Death is one of the most rewarding sidescrolling games I have played ever and it’s easily recommended due to its immense polish.
Akane,Switch,May-17-2019,Ludic Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Pure Nintendo,90,Akane is a delightful twin-stick shooter that focuses primarily on melee combat and wants the player to use their firearms sparingly. Mix this with the delightful graphics and upgrades and there is a lot of fun to be had with this game.
Slain: Back from Hell,Xbox One,Oct-21-2016,Digerati Distribution | Digerati,Action | Platformer | 2D,DarkStation,80,Perhaps the main reason why Slain: Back from Hell is both a successful tribute to the old school gaming and a damn good game in its own right is the track record of its developers. They really did some of those Amiga games I grew up with back in the day. A heartfelt thanks to the graphics artist and the man behind the concept Andrew Gilmour and his co-developers for taking me back to my teen years. A time machine isn’t invented yet but Slain: Back from Hell is surely the next best thing. Those pampered modern gamers might think otherwise as the game takes a good chunk of old school masochism to go with it.
Exist Archive: The Other Side of the Sky,PlayStation 4,Oct-18-2016,Tri-Ace,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Gaming Age,83,But hey: if you’re a fan of dungeon crawlers chances are you probably don’t mind a bit of repetition and backtracking. Exist Archive has a bit of a unique spin on the genre but I imagine that it’s not so different that it’ll alienate anyone who wants to grind their way through dungeon after dungeon. At the same time though it’s easy to imagine that it’s the kind of game that really could appeal to a wider range of people than just its core audience.
Scaler,GameCube,Nov-17-2004,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | Platformer | 3D,Next Level Gaming,80,Scaler is fun and easy to play. Its colorful characters will be sure to satisfy the children out there.
Octodad: Dadliest Catch,PC,Jan-30-2014,Young Horses | Inc,Modern | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person | Modern,GamesBeat,91,Octodad is a great example of a game that conveys a message through gameplay. In conjunction with its story characters and setting the controls offer an empathetic look into the life of an extreme outsider trying to fit in and trying to do right by his family...I love that. Gaming is growing up and Octodad is some of the best evidence of that.
Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain,PlayStation 4,Apr-11-2019,Yuke's,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,ZTGD,85,It is probably the purest throw back to the run and gun shooters of old.

Clock Tower 3,PlayStation 2,Mar-18-2003,SunSoft,Action Adventure | Horror,Cheat Code Central,90,The graphic violence is shocking. The story is captivating and the disturbing scenes are sure to make even hardcore gamers a little queasy.
Ultima Online: Third Dawn,PC,Mar-26-2001,Electronic Arts,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,GameZone,80,New features aside this is the original Ultima Online spiced up a bit but hoping to appeal to a new core of gamers. In reality what this game offers is a cyber place to meet greet and do battle.
Burnout Crash!,PlayStation 3,Sep-20-2011,Criterion Games,Action | Driving | Car Combat | Arcade | Car Combat,TotalPlayStation,85,Burnout CRASH! sounded like a disaster when we first heard about it but the final product is a pleasant diversion that captures the feel of the old Crash Mode and should provide plenty of enjoyment to longtime series fans.

Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Historic | Action Adventure | General | Linear,ActionTrip,90,This $10 standalone game is far longer than most $60 games and I still have the New Game Plus mode to try and unlock the rest of Shao Jun’s abilities.
Medal of Honor Heroes 2,PSP,Nov-13-2007,EA LA,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,IGN,84,Medal of Honor Heroes 2 is already a better overall effort than last year though it adds in a ton of event gameplay and diversity in exchange for a relatively short single player campaign and relies heavily on its online offerings.
Tony Hawk's Project 8,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,Shaba Games,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Game Chronicles,89,If you must play the game on the old PS2 youll still have a good time; albeit a lonely time. Just dont play it on the 360 or PS3 or you might never be satisfied with your classic system again. Tony has definitely made the jump to next-gen and you might want to do the same.
Raging Justice,Xbox One,May-8-2018,MakinGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Windows Central,90,Aside from the disappointing lack of playable characters Raging Justice is an impressive blast from the past that puts a forgotten style of fighting game on center stage and shows why its still fun all these years later. Its a fighting game youll love.

Lichdom: Battlemage,PC,Mar-19-2014,Xaviant Games | Xaviant,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | First-Person | Linear | Western-Style,CD-Action,80,After the first 5 hours I was delighted with Lichdom shocked by its awesomeness even. Then repetitiveness reared its ugly head and my enthusiasm started fading especially when around the 12 hour mark (when the game should have ended for its own sake) I realized that the story is far from over. Anyhow Lichdom has a spark that makes you want to come back to it and the spell crafting system is truly amazing. It’s just better to enjoy it in small doses. [Nov 2014 p.68]
The LEGO Movie Videogame,Xbox One,Feb-7-2014,TT Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,EGM,85,Another smash-and-collect game featuring everyone’s favorite building toy. This time around it’s based on the new animated movie and offers many of the hilarious characters fresh off the screen.

From Russia With Love,PlayStation 2,Nov-1-2005,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Modern,eToychest,83,A fun game that does a really good job of making you feel as if you are taking part in a classic-era Bond film. Unfortunately the overall linearity and lack of a significant multiplayer mode ensures that this is a game that will be played through once and then left on the shelf.
Snake Pass,PlayStation 4,Mar-28-2017,Sumo Digital,Action Adventure | Puzzle | Action | General,Eurogamer Italy,80,A puzzle-platform in which you can’t jump might seem like an odd idea but Snake Pass reveals itself as a great game despite some rough edges and a sometimes ruthless difficulty.

Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers,3DS,May-24-2018,Nintendo | Vanpool,Action | General,ZTGD,85,Dillon’s Dead Heat Breakers is a great title unfortunately released during a mass exodus from the 3DS to the Switch. It’s a shame because Dillon and his pal Russ are a great set of characters and the world they live in definitely could be explored even further but likely won’t as this series never really took off the way I think Nintendo hoped it would.
Conan,PlayStation 3,Oct-23-2007,Nihilistic,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Pelit (Finland),85,Conan is at its best visceral and furious fun with limbs and heads flying. Unfortunately the adrenaline level drops when the speed slows down on harder adversaries and when the enemies do not have limbs to detach or heads to pop. Also boss fights tend to follow the same pattern too much. Still it is worth the time and effort. Experimenting with different moves never gets old. [Oct 2007]
State of Mind,PC,Aug-15-2018,Daedalic Entertainment,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,Hooked Gamers,90,Despite a few drawbacks and narrative tangles State of Mind is a great game that I had a ton of fun playing. The attention thats gone into creating an engaging world results in an experience that has a lot to offer anyone willing to be a more passive participant in the engaging experience. It’s a slow burn the perfect game to relax with for a few evenings like a season of a good tv show.

Imperial Glory,PC,May-17-2005,Pyro Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Total Video Games,90,The implementation of controllable sea battles and the interactive environments certainly develops the gameplay of the combat RTS sub-genre and it’s sure to be a feature that a certain developer called Creative Assembly will be looking out for.

Darksiders III,Xbox One,Nov-27-2018,Gunfire Games | THQ Nordic,Action Adventure | Open-World,GameSpew,90,Sure it’s not as polished as the likes of God of War but I don’t care. When Darksiders III works well it’s just as entertaining. I love its character and enemy designs; its world draws you in and surprises you with the way all of its environments are linked together; and it really does have some epic boss fights. Throw in some light puzzling and an engaging story and you have a no-frills adventure game that somehow feels fresh.
Dragon Ball: Xenoverse,PlayStation 4,Feb-24-2015,Dimps Corporation,Action | Fighting | 3D,NZGamer,89,Overall Dragon Ball Xenoverse is probably one of the best if not the best Dragon Ball related games out there – and there are a lot.

SingStar Rocks!,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Cheat Code Central,86,This is a great package but the song list is always going to be a bone of contention with singers as the variety of songs is too wide to please everyone.

Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIV,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2020,Koei Tecmo Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | 4X,Digitally Downloaded,100,This reward that Romance of the Three Kingdoms offers is subtle and nuanced. This is a niche game and I would very much expect its sales to be much lower than what its rival achieved. Its the better experience though from a particular perspective. If you love your historical strategy for the history that they depict then Romance of the Three Kingdoms delivers. Everything about it is a perfect reflection on what that book was on about.

It's Quiz Time,PlayStation 4,Nov-28-2017,Vision Games Publishing LTD,Miscellaneous | Trivia / Game Show,Gaming Age,91,Whereas games like Knowledge is Power or Jeopardy! felt a little (or in Jeopardy!’s case very) impersonal It’s Quiz Time feels like it’s tailoring its experience to the individuals playing at that moment. That generic androgynous robot (Salli for the record) turns out to be funny and is constantly trash-talking and praising players by name. This extends to the app/controller as well with tailored messages flashing on each player’s screen at the end of every round giving them text they can share via social media that say how well they did in a particular round (note: I did not do this). Add in the personalized stats at the end of the game and you can see why It’s Quiz Time is so much better than its competition.

For now all we can keep hoping for in each new game is increased accuracy larger rosters better treatment of female wrestlers and fresher color commentary.
Felix the Reaper,Xbox One,Oct-17-2019,Kong Orange,Adventure | General,Xbox Tavern,83,Although somewhat unusual in its theming the level of detail and extensive research that has gone into the making of Felix the Reaper is vast and perhaps this is why it stands out so significantly.

Like any game Conan Exiles is best played with friends (and this game is AMAZING with a group of idiot friends). A battle to the death with 6 naked cannibals and a giant tiger is hands down the best gaming experience I’ve had in 2018.

Layers of Fear 2,PlayStation 4,May-28-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,Digitally Downloaded,90,I wish more horror games were like Layers of Fear 2.

Madden NFL 09,PSP,Aug-12-2008,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Sim | Sim,GameDaily,80,A Rookie mode simplifies the controls for beginners (dont worry you still have Advanced controls) and theres Franchise mode and the Madden Moments from the console editions (called Superstar Challenge) but the on-field action looks and sounds too similar to last years game.

Lost Sphear,PlayStation 4,Jan-23-2018,Tokyo RPG Factory,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,100,Lost Sphear as with I Am Setsuna before it is a beautiful heartfelt bit of classical Japanese videogame storytelling. It’s not a game that you should be playing for the gameplay in so much as it wraps nostalgia and some more modern ideas together in order to tell something that is both memorable and soulful. It’s a beautiful emotive game and with it Tokyo RPG Factory has cemented itself as one of my favourite JRPG outfits going around.
Metrico,PlayStation Vita,Aug-5-2014,Digital Dreams,General | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General,Pocket Gamer UK,90,Metrico is a beautiful imaginative and ingenious puzzle game with an original idea at its heart and some seriously sharp brainteasers.

Steel Rats,PC,Nov-7-2018,Tate Multimedia,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,Jeuxvideo.com,85,Even if it enjoys a nice art direction cool audio and nice level-design Steel Rats hardly deploys its full potential mostly because of a poorly calibrated gameplay.
Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure,3DS,Sep-24-2013,5TH Cell,Puzzle | Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Nintendojo,75,Scribblenauts Unmasked is a fun title.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - Stimulus Package,Xbox 360,Mar-30-2010,Infinity Ward,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Play.tm,80,It accomplishes what it sets out to do but the Stimulus Package feels closer to a shot of caffeine than it does adrenaline.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood,Xbox One,Jul-26-2019,MachineGames,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Impulsegamer,90,This game does not really break new ground but it is a good meat and potatoes shooter and has been well designed and promises to be an enjoyable game to play with friends.

Tiny Metal,PC,Dec-21-2017,AREA35,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Hardcore Gamer,80,Tiny Metal doesn’t copy the Advance Wars formula — it improves it. The third dimension brings with it a better way to do battle and tell where your enemies are. This change allows the tactical side of combat to flourish in a new way and one anyone who enjoys the Wars games will find it fun. It controls easily with a base controller and while PC users can get a bit of an edge using a mouse to traverse maps it isn’t a game-breaking issue for those prefer a pad. It’s a gorgeous-looking game with a cartoony art style that adds a touch of slapstick to battles which remain funny thanks to voice clips that entertain until they get a bit too long in the tooth due to repetition. Minor quibbles aside though Tiny Metal is an excellent tactical RPG at the end of the day and one that longtime fans of the genre should check out.
Ninjala,Switch,Jun-24-2020,GungHo Online Entertainment America | Inc.,Action | General,Hardcore Gamer,80,Ninjala is a well-crafted game and another fine example of free-to-play done right. You can make steady progress in the online game without spending real-world money and the only part of the game behind a paywall is the single player campaign — which is currently in its first phase. GungHo has done a great job early on at making a fun experience for players of all skill levels and still providing enough depth to sink your teeth into things when you want to. Ninjala isn’t just a great free-to-play game it’s a great game period and one well-worth checking out on Switch.

Whiplash,Xbox,Nov-18-2003,Crystal Dynamics,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamePro,90,Filled with enough chaos and wicked humor to forgive the slight reliance on platform clichés Whiplash really is a hell of a game. With a little more polish before release this game could have been a true masterpiece.

Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths,PC,Oct-31-2002,Prograph,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Just Adventure,91,It has been so long since we have had a comic adventure game that I think it is a relief to just have some fun and enjoy some ridiculous puzzles (and might I add puzzles that are purposely meant to be ridiculous).
Sega Bass Fishing Duel,PlayStation 2,Sep-23-2002,Wow Entertainment,Sports | Nature | Fishing,Gaming Age,83,With a wide variety of options fish lures modes and lakes Sega has done it again by producing a fun and addicting title for fans and non-fans alike.
Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights,GameCube,Sep-16-2002,THQ,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameZone,80,A good action game that actually manages to make excellent use of its license.
Disney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle,Game Boy Advance,Sep-14-2002,Digital Eclipse,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpy,84,It never gets quite as fun or inventive as any of the Mario or Rayman platform games but Tarzan: Return to the Jungle holds its own surprisingly well and is a must-have for fans of its GBC predecessor.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger,Xbox,Sep-10-2002,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,GameSpy,82,Its a fun romp that often lacks originality.
Battlecruiser Millennium,PC,Nov-18-2001,3000AD | Inc.,Strategy | General | General,PC Gamer,77,Its incredible depth certainly nets the game some major kudos but theres a serious caveat in the near absence of any structured gameplay. [Dec 2001 p.100]
Batman: Vengeance,Game Boy Advance,Oct-30-2001,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | General,TotalGames.net,87,Tougher than a room full of ninjas but action hero lovers will have a lot of fun trying to put an end to The Joker’s scheme.
Unison: Rebels of Rhythm & Dance,PlayStation 2,Mar-22-2001,Tecmo,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Daily Radar,88,A blast to play. The game oozes style in the same way that Space Channel 5 did and the control scheme uses the dual sticks of the PS2 controller better than anything since Ape Escape.
Metal Fatigue,PC,Jul-31-2000,Zono Inc.,Strategy | Real-Time | General | General,ActionTrip,87,With its catchy graphics and refreshing gameplay ideas it turned my skepticism into a full-fledged addictive gaming experience.
Agents of Mayhem,PC,Aug-15-2017,Volition Inc.,Action Adventure | Open-World,Quarter to Three,100,Agents of Mayhem stands mightily on its own. This is not just an open-world Overwatch. This is not just Saints Row with superheroes. This is a masterpiece that’s been waiting for 30 years to bust out from the collection of talent at Volition. For a number of reasons it demands a place among the best of the best.
Starblood Arena,PlayStation 4,Apr-11-2017,WhiteMoon Dreams,Action | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,90,StarBlood Arena is VR’s Overwatch. Oozing with personality it explodes with a style and grace that one might not expect to come from the scrappiest corners of the galaxy. The tight frenetic combat takes some standard shooter ideas and literally turns them on their head putting you in the pilot’s seat in a way only possible with virtual reality. If you haven’t taken the plunge StarBlood Arena is a damn good reason to get PSVR. If you already own one I’ll see you in the arena.
Danger Zone 2,PlayStation 4,Jul-13-2018,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,IGN,82,Danger Zone 2 is exactly what I wanted the first Danger Zone to be: the true follow-up to Burnout’s classic Crash mode that EA won’t give me. It’s not as fully fleshed out or polished as my dream game of this type would be but as a self-contained and one-note smash-up it shines like a spectacular fireball explosion. Now how about reviving the rest of Burnout? Road Rage mode anyone?
Rush: A Disney / Pixar Adventure,Xbox One,Oct-31-2017,Asobo Studio,Miscellaneous | Adventure | General | Party / Minigame,Windows Central,80,Awkward movement controls always held the original game back but now Rush plays great with a controller – and you can still use the Kinect if thats your thing. The sheer variety of franchises and gameplay make this a game that parents and Disney-loving gamers wont want to miss.
Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar,DS,Aug-24-2010,Marvelous Entertainment,Strategy | General | General | Management | Business / Tycoon,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,81,A compelling and addictive farm-sim with a new weekly market-based twist. [Sept 2011 p.94]
Blade & Soul,PC,Jan-19-2016,NCSOFT,Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer,RPG Fan,82,Blade & Souls combat system is a huge breath of fresh air in the MMO market.
Cold Fear,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Darkworks,Action Adventure | Horror,Next Level Gaming,88,It has a very good storyline backed by some great character design and some very good scares.
MARVEL Powers United VR,PC,Jul-26-2018,Sanzaru Games,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Destructoid,80,If youre looking for an epic sprawling all-star experience this isnt it but I hope this fun brawl-focused base eventually leads to that and continues to improve over time with the promised upcoming support.
The Spectrum Retreat,PC,Jul-13-2018,Dan Smith Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,The Games Machine,82,Despite some excesses in the levels structure and the evident low budget The Spectrum Retreat is a real game design diamond with a well-structured and engaging narration.
Dark Arcana: The Carnival,Xbox One,Mar-17-2017,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object,ICXM,75,Dark Arcana: The Carnival offers a great experience overall. Perhaps more engaging for a younger audience but still decent fun for all ages. A bit more creativity in names voice acting and puzzle types would make this a truly stellar game though it’s worth a creepy playthrough if only to follow the story and enjoy the sinister scenery. Dark Arcana: The Carnival proves hidden objects games can be deep and engaging.
Crimecraft: Bleedout,PC,Dec-4-2010,Vogster,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,GamingXP,77,Crimecraft: Bleedout offers many opportunities to customize your character but it looks like a remake of All Points Bulletin.
Hannspree Ten Kate Honda: SBK-07 Superbike World Championship,PlayStation 2,Oct-29-2007,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Street,AceGamez,80,A great bike racer; with fun gameplay sharp visuals good sound effects rock & roll music and enough adrenaline to keep you pumped this is definitely one game that stands out from the crowd - and if you make a space for it on your games shelf Im sure youll agree.
Mercenaries Saga Chronicles,Switch,Feb-8-2018,RideonJapan |Inc.,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Compilation | Tactics,Multiplayer.it,72,Mercenaries Saga Chronicles doesnt shine in any of its aspect but the volume of its content and the almost total absence of contenders make it a good choice for strategy lovers.
One Piece: Unlimited World Red - Deluxe Edition,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2017,Ganbarion,Action | General,Worth Playing,85,One Piece: Unlimited World Red Deluxe Edition is a great choice for anyone whos a fan of the anime show or genre. It offers an original story from the creator of the One Piece universe and it features smooth combat a gorgeous world that has clearly received a lot of development attention a ton of DLC and its wallet-friendly to boot. My only nitpicks have to do with the camera being too close to the character which interrupted the fluidity of traversing the world and there were a few slow points in the story due to a lack of clarity in missions. If youre looking for a fun and lighthearted adventure you cant go wrong with this title.
Inside My Radio,PC,May-11-2015,Seaven Studio,Action | Platformer | 2D,Vandal,80,Inside my Radio is a great platformer that deserves more attention. Its not perfect but its very addictive and when you beat it you just want more.
Silent Hill: Downpour,Xbox 360,Mar-13-2012,Konami,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Worth Playing,85,Even with an upsetting frame rate and poorly implemented combat Silent Hill: Downpour is the best weve seen in years. I enjoyed Shattered Memories but that felt more like a slightly interactive story than a video game whereas Downpour lets you explore Silent Hill in a way that hasnt been seen since Silent Hill 3.
Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals,PC,Sep-20-2008,White Birds Productions,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,IGN,82,A challenge worth taking on. Its fun to look at fun to play and its even fun to call someone you feel might be a bit smarter than you and drag them over to look at a tricky part.
UEFA EURO 2008,PSP,May-19-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,Pocket Gamer UK,80,A real European Champion. If only we could say the same about England.
The Technomancer,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Spiders,Role-Playing | General | Western-Style,ICXM,80,While the cause and effect mechanics may not be as fleshed out as in modern titles like The Witcher 3 The Technomancer blends enough new qualities with vintage attributes in order to create an authentic world and a whole bunch of electric fun.
Gungnir,PSP,Jun-12-2012,Sting,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,RPG Fan,92,If youre a more casual RPG player you might want to give Gungnir a pass but if you are a connoisseur of the SRPG genre then Gungnir will delight you like few other games will.
Prinny 2: Dawn of Operation Panties Dood!,PSP,Jan-10-2011,Nippon Ichi Software,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Extreme Gamer,90,Prinny 2: Dawn of Operation Panties Dood! may be the most frustrating PSP game youve ever played…but also one beautifully produced.
Zoo Tycoon,Xbox One,Nov-22-2013,Frontier Developments,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Post Arcade (National Post),85,This is a polished full-fledged very fun game. You’ll buy it for your kids so they don’t feel left out of the next-gen joy but once they go to bed you may well end up spending as much time designing your dream zoo as they do...Maybe more.
Cloudberry Kingdom,Xbox 360,Jul-31-2013,Pwnee Studios,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,God is a Geek,90,While later levels can get incredibly difficult Pwnee Studios absolutely nailed the difficulty curve and Story Mode completion is attainable for the majority of players thanks to some well-implemented player aids.
Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break,Switch,Jul-21-2020,ACE Team,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,Theres nothing else quite like Rock of Ages out there. Its a mesh of things that shouldnt work together and thats why I suspect no one else has tried to replicate the mad genius of ACE Teams work. Yes Rock of Ages 3 has some mild issues with pacing and the loading times could be better to suit the experimentation that is at the core of the experience but this is also the definitive version of something that is very funny ideal for both single-player and multiplayer parties and thanks to that most excellent course designer Rock of Ages 3 is functionally endless.
Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game,Switch,Oct-8-2019,Cyanide | Saber3D,Role-Playing | General,GameSpace,85,What it does have in spades is the Lovecraft mythos and it does it very well.
Killing Floor: Incursion,PlayStation 4,May-1-2018,Tripwire Interactive,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,90,The tension ratchets unbelievably high and the simple act of peeking around a corner can lead to coronary trauma when you realize that something is standing right behind you. Like any good rollercoaster ride Killing Floor Incursion delivers the chills and the fun in equal measure and is well worth the price of admission.
Black The Fall,Xbox One,Jul-11-2017,Sand Sailor Studio,Action | General,TheXboxHub,90,I love games that are clever beautifully designed tell an amazing story and make you feel for something or someone. Black the Fall ticks all my boxes.
Heart&Slash,Xbox One,Jun-24-2016,AHEARTFULOFGAMES,Action | General,TrueAchievements,80,Heart&Slash is a highly fun game that presents a real challenge and requires a lot of determination in order to progress. Unfortunately the sporadic camera spoils what would have been a great game.
Q.U.B.E. Director's Cut,Wii U,Sep-10-2015,Toxic Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Logic,Brash Games,80,To me there is no doubt that Q.U.B.E Directors Cut is a very decent Eshop offering. If you are looking for a unique puzzler with an interesting storyline and great presentation I would say you go a lot worse than this one for your money.
Master Spy,PC,Sep-8-2015,TURBOGUN,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hardcore Gamer,90,This game is not for everyone and if you didn’t grow up on super-hard games that tested every reflect it probably isn’t going to be a game you enjoy. However it is an absolute must-buy for anyone who loves a challenge. It controls perfectly looks and sounds great and does everything it sets out to do nearly flawlessly.
Shad'O,PC,Sep-4-2012,Okugi Studio,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Defense,Everyeye.it,75,ShadO is a classic tower defense characterized by a beautiful artistic design and a fairytale atmosphere. Unfortunately it is quite repetitious and it has some difficulty balancing issues.
Castlevania: Harmony of Despair,PlayStation 3,Sep-27-2011,Konami,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Pelit (Finland),80,The amount of money a player has to spend in order to get all out of this game is ridiculous especially when all of the content is recycled from older games. The multiplayer is pretty fun though. [Feb 2012]
F1 2009,PSP,Nov-16-2009,Sumo Digital,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Formula One | Formula One | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,82,The single-player is jam-packed with varied game modes. The simulation of Formula One racing is very accurate. As a bonus playing with friends through ad-hoc support is a nice touch.
Stoked,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2009,Bongfish,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Snowboarding | Snowboarding | Ski / Snowboard,Impulsegamer,85,In conclusion Stoked is probably one of the most competent snowboarding games available that although has a rather high learning curve if you do manage to put in the time the gameplay mechanics will definitely be rewarding enough.
Sherlock Holmes: The Silver Earring,PC,Sep-28-2004,Frogwares,Adventure | General | General,GamingTrend,93,A wonderful package. Dont wait on the bargain bin for this one as it is worth the price from the get go.
Earth Defense Force 2025,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2014,Sandlot,Shooter | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameCritics,95,With the art design of its monsters its staggering amount of content and battles of a scope that would make some RTSs envious EDF2025 is a masterful game almost flawless in its execution.
Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception,PlayStation 4,May-23-2017,Aqua Plus,Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,Its quite unfortunate for the sake of the game that Utawarerumono just happens to come out in a rare period when there are a lot of tactics RPGs to choose between. Fire Emblem and Disgaea both have far higher profiles and those respective games will get the bulk of the attention but for something a little more beautiful than Disgaea a little more humorous than Fire Emblem and genuinely focused on the narrative Utawarerumono is my pick of the bunch.
Joust,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,Digital Eclipse,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,VGPub,76,A remake with its heart in the right place but its mind in the gutter.
Dynasty Warriors 8,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,PlayStation Universe,90,Dynasty Warriors 8 adds in new features and options to the long-running franchise to breathe new life into the game.

SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1,PSP,May-5-2008,Terminal Reality,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,WonderwallWeb,85,Normally in compilations there is one good game and the rest is filler not the case here each game is a joy to play yes the graphics look bad by today’s standards but that’s not the point its all about playability and this disc has loads of it.
Overlord: Dark Legend,Wii,Jun-23-2009,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,NintendoWorldReport,85,A damn fine game when all is said and done. Its a focused linear experience that never really slows down.
Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2012,Asobo Studio,Adventure | General | General,Everyeye.it,80,Considering its target Kinect Rush is a well designed game that can entertain with ease lots of kids making them move a lot.
Gundam Versus,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2017,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Simulation | Fighting | Vehicle | 3D | Combat,CD-Action,95,One of the best and most popular series from Japanese arcades finally travels to the West. The single player mode is solid at most but the multiplayer is worthy of a Game of the Year mainly thanks to an amazing movement system. [13/2017 p.51]
Fossil Fighters: Champions,DS,Nov-14-2011,RED Entertainment | Artdink,Role-Playing | General | General,Nintendo Power,80,However Fossil Fighters: Champions proves to be a worthy successor to the original Fossil Fighters. [Nov 2011 p.83]
Seven: The Days Long Gone,PC,Dec-1-2017,IMGN.PRO,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Action RPG | Open-World,Gamer.nl,90,This is a game in which you can explore fail succeed and keep repeating that. That sounds easy but this is a very complex and rich RPG.
Heroki,Switch,Jul-20-2018,Picomy,Action | General,DarkStation,80,Heroki combines the premise of infinite flight with a potpourri of platformer elements. Its beautiful art style and adorable mascot hearken back to classic 16-bit adventures. The ability to fly instead of run is refreshing and Heroki’s responsive controls lessen frustration. This helps when exploring the compact mazelike levels that are abundant with secrets. It may not be a hard game but less experienced players and those who loved the heyday of 2D sidescrollers can appreciate this true blue hero.
Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom,PC,Apr-18-2017,Enigami,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Everyeye.it,78,Quotation forthcoming.
White Night,PC,Mar-3-2015,OSome Studio,Action Adventure | Survival,4Players.de,80,Despite some heavy trial-and-error and jagged edges White Night combines mansion horror like Resident Evil with an intriguing black and white art design.
Rogue Stormers,PC,Jul-17-2014,Black Forest Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,IGN Spain,82,An interesting proposal that mixes two different kinds of games like Runn gun and roguelikes. It could be much more varied on its design but Rogue Stormers manages to entertain anyone who wants to face its challenge.
Buccaneer: The Pursuit of Infamy,PC,Dec-5-2008,Stickmen Studios,Strategy | General | General,DarkStation,80,Buccaneer is a fun game made by a pair of very talented designers. The graphics are top notch and some of the best I have ever seen in an independent game.

Crash Bash,PlayStation,Nov-6-2000,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Miscellaneous | Party,Game Fan,90,I for one will be giving multiple copies of Crash Bash and multi-taps to family and friends this holiday and that alone should speak miles on just how addictive and fun this game can be in a multiplayer environment.
Orcs & Elves,DS,Nov-13-2007,id Software | Fountainhead Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,n-Revolution Magazine UK,84,A superb blend of dungeon exploration and turn-based battle. It feels old-fashioned but in a good way. [Issue#18 p.83]
Spider-Man: Web of Shadows,Xbox 360,Oct-21-2008,Treyarch | Shaba Games,Action | General | General,Game Chronicles,98,Web of Shadows assembles a great cast of heroes and villains combines them with a fantastic story and integrates an intuitive and exciting control scheme and evolving combat system that easily makes this the best Spider-Man game ever made to date for any system.

Keepsake,PC,Mar-31-2006,Wicked Studios,Adventure | Third-Person | Point-and-Click | Fantasy | Fantasy,Game Over Online,87,It has a couple of problems here and there (like odd echoes to the dialogue) but it sports a couple dozen intriguing puzzles it’s well made and it’s well acted.
Project Nimbus: Complete Edition,Switch,May-16-2019,GameCrafterTeam,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Pure Nintendo,80,Project Nimbus: Complete Edition is a fast-paced action-packed shooter with smooth controls vivid graphics and three different modes to keep you busy for a while. At the price of $20 it’s worth a try.
The Hong Kong Massacre,PC,Jan-22-2019,VRESKI,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,IGN,79,The Hong Kong Massacre is an action movie fan’s dream played out in stylish slow-motion.
Remothered: Tormented Fathers,Xbox One,Jul-25-2018,Stormind Games,Action Adventure | Survival,Xbox Tavern,81,A must have for any fan of horror. The game’s eerie atmosphere makes for some great scares with its gory cutscenes and psychotic characters collectively relaying a truly 90s-esque horrific experience. The controls are clunky at times and enemy position isn’t always made clear but with most of the other bugs now remedied ahead of release I highly recommend giving this a go.
de Blob 2,PlayStation 4,Feb-27-2018,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Video Chums,78,Even though I prefer the arcade feel of the first game de Blob 2 is certainly a must-have 3D platformer. Considering Blue Tongue Entertainment is no longer around I hope THQ Nordic gets a developer to finally create a third game some time down the road.
Nom Nom Galaxy,PC,Aug-3-2014,Q-Games,Action | General,Softpedia,75,Nom Nom Galaxy is an interesting hybrid although the variety of experiences might mean that a lot of players will have to fail a lot before they discover exactly how to approach the problem of soup production and shipping.
Chronos Twins DX,Wii,Jan-11-2010,EnjoyUp Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Console Monster,80,Aqua Panic is bright cheerful and likely to put a smile on your face even in the deepest of saturated situations.
Sinking Island,PC,Aug-21-2008,White Birds Productions,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person | Modern,Just Adventure,100,In summary I found Sinking Island to be excellent and enjoyed it immensely.
Blitz: The League II,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2008,Midway,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Arcade | Arcade,Console Monster,90,Anyone looking for a fun arcade alternative to Madden should look no further this is it.

Star Wars Battlefront II,PlayStation 4,Nov-14-2017,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Hobby Consolas,91,DICE Criterion and Motive join forces to give us a game worthy of the Force. They have learned their lesson and this time we have the Star Wars game we all deserve with enough variety and a lot of content for every kind of player.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2005,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,84,The relative ease of the gameplay and the downplay of violence makes this an excellent game for kids of all ages - yet its not completely sucky. A first-rate adventure for everyone.
Kill la Kill: IF,PlayStation 4,Jul-26-2019,Studio TRIGGER | Aplus,Action Adventure | General | Action | Fighting | 3D,TheSixthAxis,90,Kill La Kill -IF- may just be the perfect anime video game. It almost flawlessly manages to embrace the style and energy of the original anime and translate that into an enthralling arena fighter that is just as much fun solo as it is competitively. The art is incredible the music is astounding and the story mode goes above and beyond to deliver a fresh narrative that fans of the anime will eat up. Whether youre a Kill La Kill megafan or just a fighting game enthusiast this is a must play.
Strange Brigade,PC,Aug-28-2018,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,GameGrin,90,I wasn’t expecting a huge amount from Strange Brigade but what I got was a really enjoyable experience both offline and online. This was a pleasant surprise as generally I’m not someone who would usually play online if I can avoid it. The fact that even I preferred playing online speaks volumes about Rebellion’s efforts in making a game that’s best played in co-op. There are a few things that could have been done better but nothing that can’t be overlooked. This is one of my favourite multiplayer games in a very long time.
The Shattering,PC,Apr-21-2020,SuperSexySoftware,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Cultured Vultures,80,Thanks to some clever subversion of a troubling dive into the psyche The Shattering could go down as a new favourite in the narrative thriller genre.
Koihime Enbu,PC,May-19-2016,M2 | UNKNOWN GAMES,Action | Fighting | 2D,Vandal,82,Koihime Enbu is a solid fighting game. We would like to have a few more characters but apart from that its a really interesting title for 2D-fighting lovers.

This coupled with great graphics interactive environments and a killer soundtrack make ICON an easy game to recommend.
Bubble Bobble 4 Friends,Switch,Nov-19-2019,ININ Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Age,100,All in all I found Bubble Bobble 4 Friends to be a really fun take on the old Taito franchise and a great experience for old and new players alike. It makes for a really solid family game that’s appropriate for all ages but one with a difficulty curve that won’t make the game a bore for parents or older siblings. So check it out now on the Nintendo Switch I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.
MotoGP 17,PlayStation 4,Jul-11-2017,Koch Media | Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,GameOver.gr,85,In contrast to MXGP3 with MotoGP 17 Milestone created a complete racer with superb mechanics and a fantastic riding model that is as close to reality as a videogame can get.
Battleborn,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Gearbox Software,Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Arcade,Hardcore Gamer,90,Battleborn has done what I would have previously thought was impossible: it has kept me interested in its multiplayer. I typically grow bored with adversarial multiplayer after about an hour or two yet I have spent so much time with this title already and want to keep going.

Masochisia,PC,Oct-9-2015,Oldblood,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Ragequit.gr,86,Raw otherworldly and at times hauntingly familiar. Masochisia is a dark diamond hidden from plain sight. The experience it offers to the brave souls who seek it out lingers long after its disturbing end.
MySims Racing,Wii,Jun-12-2009,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart | Automobile,NZGamer,85,Can we honestly expect MySims Racing to become some sort of darling? Probably not. Everyone knows Mario Karts all over it. But that doesnt mean that you shouldnt give it a whirl.
Brink,Xbox 360,May-10-2011,Splash Damage,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IncGamers,88,If youre looking for an in-depth engaging experience that rewards practise and team work and represents a welcome break from the stagnate place the genre has found itself then you can do a lot worse than Brink. If youre looking for a drop-in/drop-out ten-minutes-a-night-and-Im-done shooter then you could do a lot better than Brink.
Vanguard: Saga of Heroes,PC,Jan-30-2007,Sigil Games Online,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Play.tm,81,Even thought the game has its annoyances (like the steep death penalty you have to endure) its a very accomplished title with a lot of rewards for a dedicated player.
Outcast: Second Contact,PC,Nov-14-2017,Appeal | Bigben Interactive | Bigben Games,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Open-World,PLAY! Zine,85,Although not without its flaws the everlasting quality of this game cannot be overlooked.
