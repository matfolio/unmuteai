Katana ZERO,PC,Apr-18-2019,Askiisoft,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hooked Gamers,95,Katana Zero is on the short side but it uses every minute of its 5-6 hour run-time well packed to the brim with satisfying carnage and a brain-bending narrative. It’s not often that a game so completely blindsides me entering my radar and winning me over so quickly and it’s a wonderful feeling when it happens. In fact my only gripe and it’s incredibly minor is that I wish there was just a little bit more of it to love. I have no hesitations about recommending this game for just about everyone.

It’s a classic in every sense and deserves to be played by as many people as possible.

Freedom Planet,PC,Jul-21-2014,GalaxyTrail,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameCritics,100,The most impressive thing about Freedom Planet is just how good it feels. It feels great to find the correct sequence of actions to send Lilac rocketing through a level at warp speed. It feels great hearing each song on the excellent soundtrack for the first time. It feels great to nail the perfect spin dash on an enemy and absolutely shred it. That type of exhilaration is rare and worthy of praise.

GalaxyTrail please take a bow.

The expansion offers some closure on certain story threads whilst telling a self-contained tale that’s perfect for this ruined world you find yourself in. There’s little in terms of mechanical upgrades to the game but Horizon never needed that in the first place...If you’re craving 15-20 hours adventuring in a world crafted by artisan game designers you can’t go wrong with The Frozen Wilds which is easily one of the best DLC packages on offer this year.

Detention,PlayStation 4,Oct-3-2017,Red Candle Games,Adventure | General,Digitally Downloaded,100,The best way to experience the game is to play it yourself in one three hour sitting without distractions or prior information. It gives the same experience as a really good movie one which you really become attached to the characters and are invested in their personalities for the entire time. There are some scary moments to keep things interesting but I would recommend this one for those who want a more psychological emotional game which challenges the way they see the world. Red Lantern have proved themselves to be masters of both narrative and game design and nothing would make me happier than for the whole world to come and appreciate the unique Taiwanese flavour that Detention brings to the indie game scene.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd,PC,May-3-2017,Falcom,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Wccftech,95,A more than worthy continuation of the Trails in the Sky saga tying up some loose ends from the previous game while setting up events for the following entries.

Little Nightmares,Xbox One,Apr-28-2017,Tarsier Studios,Action Adventure | General | Linear,XBLA Fans,100,Little Nightmares is dark eerie startling gross and sinister – all without resorting to M-rated content or a first-person camera. Its a great puzzle-platformer that is amazingly atmospheric where the scariest parts are a fun gameplay experience rather than a game-halting fright. In many ways it reminded me of Inside but I have to be honest: despite being a little more rough around the edges I like Little Nightmares more.
Stacking,PlayStation 3,Feb-8-2011,Double Fine Productions,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Puzzle | Action,1UP,100,Stacking proves that lively character and set designs catchy music and clever writing are far more important in making a good game than simply simply adding filler to extend the quantity of gameplay hours.

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction,PC,Apr-27-2010,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,GamePro,100,Why Sam has stepped out of the shadows and is on full out attack makes complete sense in context with the story so if you can accept it for what it is and not dwell on the fact that it isnt what youve come to expect in a Splinter Cell title youll no doubt agree that Conviction rivals Chaos Theory as the best title in the franchises history.

Sega Ages: Sonic the Hedgehog 2,Switch,Feb-20-2020,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gamer Escape,90,The big takeaway here is that a port of Sonic 2 is still a port of a classic. I still consider the Whitehead version of the game to be the definitive release but I’ll continue to fret at the fact that it’s still locked away on mobile devices.

Flipping Death,Switch,Aug-7-2018,Zoink!,Action | General,Vooks,100,Everything about the game is a bright shining star. The story and character design the voice talent music and art design. If I was going to compare it to something which Im going to Id say its on par with that of a Tim Schaffer game. This is only a good thing.

Code:Realize - Guardian of Rebirth,Switch,Feb-6-2020,Otomate,Adventure | Visual Novel,Digitally Downloaded,90,Code: Realize is a beautiful visual novel with a wonderful concept that is written wonderfully.

SOMA,Xbox One,Dec-1-2017,Frictional Games,Action Adventure | Survival,ZTGD,95,Soma is still as enthralling for me as I remember even two years later. It’s burned its story and themes into my brain ironically enough and while I forgot little bits here and there I was shocked at just how much the game has stayed with me all this time later. I could go on and more in depth but our other review has readers covered. Like re-opening and reading a great book or re-watching a fantastic movie Soma retains its strong story driven focus and themes it transpired through videogame format and I still have just as much admiration for it as I did on release and it still gets the same score it originally earned.

Art of Balance Touch!,3DS,Jun-7-2012,Shin'en,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,NintendoWorldReport,90,Overall Art of Balance Touch! is a remarkable title and one that would be hard not to recommend to any 3DS owner. It a polished experience but also a great title to just pick up and play and the added Endurance mode does a great job of extending the games life well after all the worlds have been completed.
NHL Eastside Hockey Manager 2005,PC,Oct-5-2005,Sports Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Management | Sim,FiringSquad,90,A management nut’s dream. It doesn’t have quite all the depth options of Worldwide Soccer Manager 2006 (better known as Football Manager 2006) but the number of options and the veracity of the simulation are staggering compared to anything that EA or 2K Games have come out with.
Legend of Grimrock,PC,Apr-11-2012,Almost Human,Role-Playing | General | General,Destructoid,95,The level design enemy placement and especially the puzzles are all by and large wonderfully crafted. There are a few instances where the traps seem more unfair than clever but that hardly tarnishes what is otherwise a terrific experience. Youll be hard-pressed to find a modern game like Legend of Grimrock any time soon but with a game of this quality you wont need one.
DiRT Rally 2.0,Xbox One,Feb-26-2019,Codemasters,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Generación Xbox,92,DIRT Rally 2.0 is the definite rally simulator. Codemasters refine the already great formula giving us an indispensable piece of work if youre a fan of racing games.
Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition,Switch,Feb-20-2020,Capcom,Action Adventure | Linear,GamingTrend,95,While Devil May Cry 3 is starting to show its age it still holds its title as one of the best character action games ever made. The new additions add a refreshing twist on this classic game while still retaining its difficulty and depth. And who knows after so many re-releases and playthroughs maybe people will notice how meaningful and well told the story is.

Control,PlayStation 4,Aug-27-2019,Remedy Entertainment,Action Adventure | General,Quarter to Three,100,I don’t want to use the word masterpiece lightly but what else do you call the combination of gleefully chaotic gameplay with earnest storytelling in a setting as refreshingly unique as Bioshock? What else do you call a combat system that goes so far beyond the simple act of shooting a gun without drilling down into a set of intricate menus and complicated controls? What else do you call darkly malevolent horror that doesn’t feel like it was cribbed from someplace else? What else do you call the crowning achievement of a studio with a unique voice an uneven track record and 25 years of experience? If there’s a better word to describe what Remedy has achieved with Control I can’t think of it.
College Hoops 2K6,Xbox,Nov-21-2005,2K Sports,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Sim,DarkStation,90,A smooth flowing basketball game complete with a huge franchise mode and Live online play.

Dominions 3: The Awakening,PC,Sep-29-2006,Illwinter Design Group,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameZone,90,For those TBS fans out there this will most likely be one of the best games out there. Though it carries a hefty MSRP of about 50 bucks It is very unlikely that any game will be exactly the same. There is just too much content for that.
eFootball PES 2020,PlayStation 4,Sep-10-2019,Konami,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,IGN Italia,92,PES keeps getting better: a great experience on the pitch with improved AI and gorgeous animations.
NyxQuest: Kindred Spirits,Wii,Aug-10-2009,Over the Top Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Nintendo Life,90,A beautiful looking game which is also lots of fun to play. It’s true that it is not a massive game you should be able to beat it 100% in just 3 hours but those 3 hours will be completely filled with pure platforming bliss. This is exactly the sort of thing we want to see more of on WiiWare and comes highly recommended to all.
Dishonored: Death of the Outsider,PlayStation 4,Sep-15-2017,Arkane Studios,Action Adventure | General,NZGamer,93,Overall Death of the Outsider ties up the first arc of Dishonored nicely; I have no idea where it’s going to go next and all I can do is pray that Arkane don’t call it a day because I adore this series. All other issues seem trivial in the face of it being such a well-crafted piece of art and my main complaint is that there simply isnt enough of it. I adore this series and this game. Buy it play it and love it.
Prince of Persia Classic,Xbox 360,Jun-13-2007,Gameloft,Action | Adventure | Platformer | General | 2D,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,100,The best. Only better. A 2D game of this quality lushly redesigned is worth a hundred 3D romps. [Sept 2007 p.94]
Star Fox Adventures,GameCube,Sep-22-2002,Rare Ltd.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Play Magazine,100,A triumph and a very bittersweet one at that. Sadly its become the ultimate swan song marking the end of one of the greatest relationships in videogame history. [Nov 2002 p.72]
Borderlands Legendary Collection,Switch,May-29-2020,Gearbox Publishing | Turn Me Up Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation,DarkStation,100,Fifty dollars might seem like a hefty price tag to pay for a set of games considering the latest game in it is six years old but the Borderlands Legendary Collection offers so much value and content to justify the price tag. However it is possible to buy the games separately if you’d like. With the literal hundreds of hours of gameplay that can be played anywhere you go The Borderlands Legendary Collection belongs in every action game fan’s Switch library.
Two Point Hospital,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2020,Two Point Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Management | Virtual | Career | Business / Tycoon,Worth Playing,90,Overall Two Point Hospital is a treat on consoles and is not to be missed especially given the inclusion of the DLC and almost all of the features from the PC.

I can’t recommend Broken Steel highly enough. If you have Fallout 3 you need Broken Steel to go with it.
Call of Duty 3,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2006,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GameDaily,100,Combined with the single player campaign Call of Dutys online play rounds out a very impressive package one that throttles the senses and shakes the soul.
GRID 2,PlayStation 3,May-28-2013,Codemasters,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,90,Grid 2 comes close to perfection but since nothing or nobody is perfect we would like to point out a few tiny little flaws.

Mario Kart Wii,Wii,Apr-27-2008,Nintendo,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Kart | Automobile,AceGamez,100,Mario Kart Wii has more variety more to do and ultimately more to keep you coming back than any Mario Kart before it (and as a hardcore advocate of the SNES original I never thought I would find myself saying that); but more than that it is a flagship title for the Nintendo Wii. Not only is Mario Kart Wii the most important title that will be released on the format this year but it will stand the test of time as one of the best games the Wii has to offer.
College Hoops 2K8,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2007,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Gaming Age,91,The biggest change from 2K7 to 2K8 is 2K Share. Getting rosters should have been this easy ever since all our consoles used the Internet out of the box. For some of us that one feature will be all we need to hear to commit to another version of College Hoops.
GRIS,PlayStation 4,Nov-26-2019,Nomada Studio,Action | Platformer | 2D,The Digital Fix,100,This is the first time I have given a game 10/10. I said I never would give a game that score but I cannot find anything bad to say about Gris. Its near-perfect. Brilliant art style beautiful music and brilliant gameplay.

Desktop Dungeons,PC,Oct-17-2010,QCF Design,General | Role-Playing | General | Roguelike,Quarter to Three,100,Remember when you thought this was a frivolous roguelike and not a seriously meaty strategy game that you’ll be playing for literally days? How silly of you.

Sega Genesis Collection,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,Digital Eclipse,Miscellaneous | Compilation,GameShark,100,One of the best game collections ive had the pleasure of playing this year.
