Call of Juarez: The Cartel,PlayStation 3,Jul-19-2011,Techland,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,55,Some distinguishing features give this shooter a touch of class but bugs and execution flaws cast a long shadow over Call of Juarez: The Cartel.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,Pelit (Finland),60,Dead Horde is dead awful. [Sept 2011]
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,80,Sugary sweet and addictive puzzle fun. [May 2008 p.93]
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,TheSixthAxis,70,The motion controls aren’t the best and I wouldn’t recommend using them while the stuttering on the loading screens also needs addressing. If you’re looking for a small game to play though and like first person runners then Infinity Runner could well be for you.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Xbox Nation Magazine,60,Everything about it screams budget sure but there are much worse full-priced games on the Xbox. [Oct/Nov 2003 p.99]
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,PlayStation LifeStyle,65,The gameplay loop of loot shoot and run all feels good and I’d like to see more story added to the game. Also it would be great if there were more machines more weapons and proper difficulty scaling for players who want to play by themselves. Above all the world is just too big.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Computer Games Magazine,50,Given the decidely mixed gameplay you have to have a certain love of kitsch to get far in Hard Truck Apocalypse. [Oct. 2006 p.68]
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,Operation Sports,60,For $20 you get a variety of games that is far beyond anything else that I’ve played on the PS2. The game plays well if you don’t feel like you have to have a deep and detailed story mode.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Eurogamer Italy,70,This game is for gamers who love jrpg manga anime moe and those kinds of entertainment. The main concept is funny enough to catch the players interest and the gameplay is quite good. Unfortunatly the graphs engine is old and clumsy.
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,SpazioGames,65,Bravo Team is a good game that manages to recreate the feeling of collaborative shooters from the old days.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,50,There’s moments of fun to be found here but I think I’d be better suited trying my luck on the consoles – at least there I can expect a solid framerate and finer camera control. But the search for a quality 3DS character action game will have to continue for now.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,PSM Magazine,60,Had potential but its ultimately too unpolished and player unfriendly for any but the most puzzle hardcore. [July 2005 p.88]
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,GameSpy,60,The elements were in place for a solid platforming title with a little hand-to-hand combat thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately a painfully annoying camera and some downright boring combat kept that from coming to fruition.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Informer,65,With better action games out there for GBA I suggest leaving this earthworm to the fisherman. [Sept 2002 p.94]
Shadow the Hedgehog,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2005,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,IC-Games,53,The magic of the 2D versions have all but been lost in a search for technical accomplishment and it suffers terribly for it.
Crash: Mind Over Mutant,DS,Oct-7-2008,TOSE,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Game Chronicles,70,I will have to say that Crash: Mind Over Mutant is a very fun and innovative game that is easy to get into and play.
Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Jolt Online Gaming UK,55,This game is an unchallenging space shooter made a little more difficult with frustrating design and a terrible camera angle. Even if you’re a fan of the TV series we really cannot recommend a purchase.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Hobby Consolas,65,The new project from Sonic’s father Yuji Naka brings an adventure on sky pretty difficult to control with beautiful but simple landscapes and an amazing story. Sadly we expected more from the little robot Rodea.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,Video Game Talk,60,Warriors: Legends of Troy is a pretty impressive project from Tecmo-Koei Canada. It features an interesting storyline that provides a great backdrop for a video game as well as some well-done cutscenes and audio. However its repetitive gameplay is something that will turn a lot of people off even if it is more polished than its ever been.
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Game Over Online,68,I came into it expecting something terrible given the reputation of past Ford games but I ended up with an above average game that didnt really screw anything up and actually featured innovation - so Im quite pleased with it.
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamingExcellence,64,If Darkest of Days were a film it would make the rounds at festivals where flawed but interesting has its place. But there are no festivals in gaming outside of the ten games that get selected for spotlight every year at PAX.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,65,Far from being a masterpiece The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2 for a budget price offers a single player campaign that lasts about five hours an interesting co-op mode for four players and a series of classic multiplayer competitive modes.
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GamingTrend,67,But if youre a person who doesnt want to wait around for patches and who likes a gaming experience you can glide into rather than struggle through I sadly suggest either giving this one a pass or at least giving it time to get patched up in time for a steep Steam sale.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Game Informer,60,About as much fun as giving an elephant a suppository. [Jan 2006 p.157]
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Cheat Code Central,52,Just like the first entry this one doesnt try to escape from the simple button mashing combo street brawler.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Game Informer,60,Fighting moving and pulling off cooperative attacks as the Turtles is enjoyable but it’s difficult to find fun in the world and routine in which they exist.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,TeamXbox,56,For younger gamers it tries to offer some valuable lessons about respect for others and responsibility but the message seems to be clouded by all the pointless side missions and mindless monologues of other characters.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Official Xbox Magazine,58,The gameplay however suffers from severe redundancy. [Jan 2003 p.83]
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,GameSpy,67,The framerate is horrendously bad at times. Theres no logical reason why a game representing a sport with nearly as many TOTAL players as other sports have per TEAM should suffer framerate hits.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,MS Xbox World,65,As a Watchmen fan it was impossible for me to not enjoy this game. For anyone else however there just isn’t enough substance to warrant the ridiculously overpriced cost.
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,TeamXbox,50,The drive anywhere at anytime mentality that seems to be the driving force just wasnt executed well enough so instead the game remains a generic racer with a Hummer coating.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameZone,55,Repetitious button-mashing gameplay that rarely engages the brain is the undertone of this title.
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,ZTGD,68,Last Rebellion is a game that will likely become a niche title down the road and for good reason. The combat system is definitely something special. If only everything else had come together this game could have easily been a must-own.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Pocket Gamer UK,50,Buggy and unpolished Chronovolt isnt worth your time no matter how many times your turn the clock back.
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,SpazioGames,70,Ryder White is a good DLC. It is essential to understand background and mentality of the greatest enemy in Dead Island. If you loved the full game dont miss it.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameZone,62,The actual gameplay is unlikely to impress serious gamers and may to some the game may be found seriously wanting.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Game Informer,60,Playing through State of Emergency 2 is a lot like watching a decent actor try to produce a real performance in a straight-to-video horror movie. [Apr 2006 p.122]
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,Switch Brasil,50,AeternoBlade II had the potential to be a notable metroidvania in the Nintendo Switch’s library but unfortunately it will be remembered as little more than a bug-laden mess regardless of the couple of interesting ideas it brought forward.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,Nintendo Life,50,Fimbul creates an appealingly grim Norse folklore-infused world to adventure through but its core action is simply too weak to seal the deal. Its pacy combat can be brutally satisfying but its also shallow and repetitive while the game struggles from a technical perspective. Theres a promising world at the heart of Fimbul but it needs to be married to a more fluid and fleshed-out game.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,3DJuegos,58,Golden Axe: Beast Rider confuses the tribute to retro with the flat and boring gameplay. The new game of SEGA is mediocre in every aspect and comes as a failure in its attempt to recover a legendary name and turn it into a worthy product of Next-Gen platforms.
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Multiplayer.it,55,MotoGP 08 delivers a sub-par experience in every single aspect: graphics are shallow controls are dull and unresponsive and the gameplay is kinda boring. Still its one of the few serious racing games on Wii but thats hardly gonna be a selling point.
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,AceGamez,50,Hard Rock Casino shouldnt be a terrible game but it is.
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Informer,55,Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back underwhelms and disappoints at every turn. Bland level design never improves and tedious boss battles are unrewarding and unsatisfying. Bubsys return 21 years later could have reminded us why he was once considered a potential peer to the likes of Mario and Sonic. Instead The Woolies Strike Back only serves to remind us why the mascot hasnt seen a new adventure in over two decades.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,MondoXbox,55,A mere add-on to the previous game short and without any improvements to the first game even losing features like Kinect support.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GamingExcellence,50,Swashbucklers doesn’t have anything that’s worth the purchase and it can be looked over by most gamers.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,70,Discs of Tron does hold quite a bit of enjoyment especially of the latter stages. [Issue#31 p.117]
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,BonusStage,66,Though Splat Magazine Renegade Paintball has some serious problems it delivers an authentic paintball experience rife with intense adrenaline-pumping action that is sure to please fans of the sport and possibly snag some new ones in the process.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Computer and Video Games,58,If humorous driving jaunts are your bag do yourself a favour and bag San Andreas instead.
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,3DJuegos,58,Its the same game youve been playing a long time ago. At least Koei fanatics might be satisfied with the formula.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,VideoGamer,60,As it is Big Beach Sports will provide some fairly limited short term fun but when available for less than £20 maybe thats not such a bad thing.
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,Game Over Online,62,I can’t think of another game where the developers apparently tried so hard to make it no fun to play. As a result The Sacred Rings is just a bad game. The puzzles are tedious the locations are dark and the premise is silly (you actually spend more time trying to reunite two dead lovers than you do dealing with the Sacred Rings).
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,LevelUp,53,Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark main problems are that High Moon Studios didnt developed it and that the terrible Michael Bays movie Transformers: Age of Extinction was merged with the marvelous universe of War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,TotalGames.net,65,At a tenner this would have been okay but for a penny under £20 this just can’t be recommended.
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,Dreamcast.net,61,The fact is both NFL2K and NFL2K blow this game away on literally every level.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,Push Square,60,Its a quaint little curio for fans of arcade games then but its not exactly a must have.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,60,The biggest issue is not that the development set their sights incredibly high but simply that this kind of game is a mammoth project and there is simply no way that a limited budget can pull off something of the standard of say Skyrim. Risen 3 is a raw entertaining experience that lacks polish but offers substance.
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,MS Xbox World,60,It looks nice it plays nicely and its short BUT it is a budget title and at £20 it is a steal.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Nintendojo,65,Every platforming challenge is camera related. Its sad because there is a lot of untapped potential in Pac-Man World 3.
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Da Gameboyz,55,Overall this is the nicest cleanest 3D game I have yet to see on the 3DS. I cant wait to see more titles from Ubisoft as it appears that they have utilized the 3D screen to its fullest. Unfortunately for its lack of gameplay variety and the simplistic controls I do not recommend it for more mature gamers.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,COGconnected,60,One could also make the argument that if a game’s story is poor the gameplay can at least make up for it and vice versa. Husk manages come frustratingly close at times leaving the game undone by its inconsistency.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,TheSixthAxis,70,Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise is a much better effort than its predecessor. By adding in the costumes system 505 Games have managed to give the game a layer of depth previously missing. However whilst repetition doesnt entirely spoil the party it certainly takes the shine off after a while.
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,Nintendojo,50,In the end I was left with the feeling that Johnny Kung Fu was sold short of its true potential. The basic premise is good the gameplay (well half of the gameplay…) is spot on but sadly the game is hindered by an unnecessarily brutal spike in difficulty and a repetitive unrewarding design that makes a game that was once unique and challenging turn into to a bore of a reaction-time test.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,Level7.nu,50,Funtown Mahjong is a simplified version of the more complex Chinese board game mahjong. The main issue plaguing this title is the fact that its not simple enough to attract the uninitiated while not being challenging enough for the veterans. The game could very well have utilized the possibilities that a console game offers to the gameplay mechanics but since this isnt the case youll be better of taking a closer look at the real deal.
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,60,Unlocking different vehicles and tracks for the multiplayer provides some incentive to push onward but theres not much past that.
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,Game Chronicles,61,Sadly enough these great features cannot save you from a horrendous storyline generic sounds and iffy controls.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Informer,58,In this day and age it shouldn’t come as a surprise that a game based on a movie fares poorly but for a character who has survived since 700AD he deserves better treatment than this.
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,Next Level Gaming,74,The graphics hold the game back as most PC RPGs are better looking.
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,GamePro,80,The visuals and sounds keep up with the pace although you may be too busy with the controller to notice.
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,MS Xbox World,60,Unfortunately for Street Trace there are just far too many better games coming down the road for it to be able to maintain the multiplayer community it will need to succeed.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Next Level Gaming,59,There comes a time when you should just move on. I think Tom Clancy games and the Playstation 2 should go ahead and part ways. The system just isnt powerful enough to do what I think UbiSoft really wants to do with their games.
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,Destructoid,50,If Harmonix Music VR sounds like your jam it probably is. Plopping on the helmet after eating your favorite comfort food can make for a really relaxing afternoon but the other modes arent even worth the time of day.
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameZone,64,The dated graphics repetitive sounds and high difficulty make this game more frustrating than it has to be.
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Worth Playing,55,You could definitely pass up C.O.R.E. and while I like the idea of someone at least trying to put out a genre title that doesnt typically get made on the NDS I also feel that C.O.R.E. is an example of why FPSes dont make the transition well to the DS.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,Next Level Gaming,62,If any more Oddworld games are brought to the GBA I really hope that they go back to the side-scrolling format. In fact a direct port of the original Oddworld for Playstaion wouldnt be a bad idea and would have surely come out better than this game did.
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,Yahoo!,70,An absolute must for fans of the series - its as engrossing and complex as the best of Anne McCaffreys novels and as a stand-alone story its fun and well worth it.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Pocket Gamer UK,50,Visually disappointing lacking in challenge and generally not that much fun Iron Man singularly fails to communicate the excitement found in its big screen counterpart.
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,Game Informer,65,Even with relatively few RPGs on the GameCube Falsebound Kingdoms relatively simple approach isnt that captivating - unless youre a Yu-Gi-Oh fan who is a newbie to the RPG genre. [Jan 2004 p.141]
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Gamer's Pulse,50,The fighting is slow and boring with even slower controls the graphics aren’t much and the sound is just average.
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Hot Games,60,If youre a fan of the child-eating boxer help yourself to a serving of Mike Tyson Boxing. Otherwise spend your bet money on Knockout Kings or Ready 2 Rumble 2.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Sadly the games not much fun - you get bored easily and theres not much variety to be had waving your arms up and down. [Dec 2006 p.99]
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,TeamXbox,55,When all is said and done Hellboy: The Science of Evil might have been a hit during the last generation of consoles. On the current consoles though it just falls short in nearly every regard.
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,Switch Player,70,A game which seems to draw a lot from Resident Evil Vaccine is more than just a clone; its a hard-as-nails rendition of what the series would be like if it was procedurally generated and smaller in scope. At this theyve succeeded and have managed to weave in some fun to boot. Its not the best Resident Evil clone Ive ever played but its better than average - and the gameplay twists are both addictive and satisfying in their own right.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,Multiplayer.it,60,Cortex Command is brilliant but unfortunately still incomplete. The strong community is trying to fix the many problems the games has but as of now it still not enough. For almost twenty euros we can recommend the game only to the most patient gamers.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,IGN,49,It’s easy to see how paintball enthusiasts could love this game but hard to envision anybody else spending more than an hour playing it before they got bored and disillusioned.
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Zentendo,60,Overall the Iron Man title on the Wii lacked the spark that the film had; however it’s a huge step up from last years A2M film franchise adaptation known as The Golden Compass. That said if players are looking for a film to game adaptation that actually reflects the film they should look elsewhere.
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Play Magazine,60,BS is no gem mind you but it is strangely addicting as these games tend to be when the mood strikes. [June 2003 p.57]
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Games Master UK,60,Disturbing lack of content impedes the score but what is here is streamlined speedy fun. [March 2012 p.75]
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,AusGamers,52,This is not going to set the gaming world on fire by any means but if youre a sucker for movie tie-ins have reasonable to low FPS expectations and dont mind some light RTS antics Battleship is a decent enough distraction for a handful of hours or so.
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Computer Games Online RO,61,The main problem of SunAge is that without the patches released the game is a disaster.
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,Hobby Consolas,62,Submersed is a survival horror game with good ideas drowned by a short duration bad enemy and level design weak gameplay and a narrative that feels underdeveloped.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Games Master UK,58,A great concept brimming with unexplored potential anchored by dull shooter mechanics.
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Xbox Achievements,55,As endless runners go Infinity Runner is a fine example but greatly lacks polish and finesse.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Game Informer,58,The huge level of frustration is not worth the time it takes to master the awkward gameplay idiosyncrasies. Instead it’s more tempting – even as someone with experience – to just spam the waggle movements for a passable high score.
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameSpot,54,While the online play is merely average at best its single-player play as well as its overall production values present themselves as seriously subpar.
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameZone,60,Some of the individual aspects of the game need to be reworked simply because they seem forced. The game strives to attain a lofty place but comes up a little short.
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Operation Sports,68,Sluggish at best and the controls leave a lot to be desired. Very often this game looks like it is moving at half speed and you never get that visual feeling of speed that you get from other titles.
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,GameSpot,63,Despite a slick presentation and several clearly enjoyable moments Salt Lake fails to capture the magnitude of this periodic winter spectacle and is in reality an entertaining yet brief whirl through just a fraction of the events you might expect.
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,PlayStation Universe,60,Calvino Noir starts off strong with a great setting and cast of characters but finds itself almost totally crippled on account of its heavily flawed stealth mechanics; a tragically missed opportunity.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,60,A strict time limit also detracts from whats otherwise a fun game. [Nov 2008 p.104]
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,Gamers.at,69,A downright frightening army of bugs both scares away any potential fan of Gothic and eliminates any fun that could have been had with the game. [Issue#17]
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Everyeye.it,60,Quotation forthcoming.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,NZGamer,60,If however youre after something inoffensive to entertain the youngsters without having to explain about death the birds and the bees or any other adult themes you could do worse.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,59,Has its shining moments of fun but these precious moments are overshadowed by a far greater evil--terrible level design and slow-as-molasses controls.
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Official Xbox Magazine,61,Its fundamentals are solid enough but too bland and redundant. [Jan 2003 p.78]
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,Electric Playground,55,The problem is much of it is done so darned sloppily.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Meristation,60,Bombshell is an old school action game. It is fun and has a couple of good ideas but it has a lot of mistakes too. A boring interface a wrong camera.
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,Games Master UK,53,Though it can pack a punch this lacks the finesse to tell the subversive war story its aiming for. [Sept 2014 p.74]
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,Cynamite,60,Terminator: Salvation is a run-of-the-mill game adaption of a successful movie brand. Overall okay but way too short and without any highlights or variety.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,360 Gamer Magazine UK,60,And while it’s a solid enough shooter that’ll largely cure the itch for frag-heads it just fails to do anything to particularly excite.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Multiplayer.it,55,Star Trek does a good job in terms of script and atmosphere and its decent on long-distance gunplay. But the overall experience is poor and unpolished.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GamePro,70,Its fun enough but its definitely not dangerous.
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,IGN,55,A game that’s probably better left to pen and paper. The game offers solid variety and decent puzzle design but at the end of the day you’re still doing with a controller that which is much easier and just as rewarding with a pencil.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Vandal,70,The best thing we can say about its campaign is that it works as a tutorial. The multiplayer mode is the key of this title but you need to understand how it really works to make the most of it.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,DarkStation,60,In the case of Everreach: Project Eden some mechanical issues with AI or balance can be patched which other problems are more in the realm of aesthetics and direction and are probably doomed to never go away. There’s nothing wrong with a game having a clear inspiration — most every game does — but failing to innovate on that model can result in what we have here a product that feels like an unconvincing imitation.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Blood Knights is too easy to ever become actively irritating but its deficit of danger makes it too darn dull to hold even a devoted horror nut’s attention for long. Perhaps it’s a blessing then that the whole ho-hum campaign clocks in at just four hours.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,My Gamer,56,All in all there’s very little reason to get Digimon World: Data Squad. Between the simplistic-yet-frustrating battle system and the absolutely terrible graphics there just isn’t anything positive to say about the game.
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,GamingTrend,50,Just do yourself a favor skip this game and go have fun with the real thing.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,MS Xbox World,65,Upon first sight and play this game can be judged quite easily as a bog standard mediocre racing frenzy game any excuse for a bit of chaos.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Games (Russia),55,Even if you are a Ghostbusters fan Sanctum of Slime is still difficult to recommend – it hardly contains any fanservice at all. [May 2011 p.81]
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,Digital Chumps,68,Its a manufactured experience thats still more superficial than engrossing but its a step in the right direction.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GamingXP,64,If you like epic storytelling skip this one. The KI is lame and doesnt motivate you at all but the multiplayer is fun for a few hours.
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,69,Only a select few will be hooked for more than a few seasons. John Deere Harvest in the Heartland is extremely addictive but also extremely frustrating – not because the game is challenging or cheap but because of the inexcusable issues that prevent it from reaching its full potential.
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Overall it makes for a slightly better game than Pac-Man and Ms Pac-Man though thats not saying much. [Feb 2007 p.101]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Absolute Games,50,A more experienced studio could have made lemonade from these licensed lemons and turn the final chapter into a good action shooter. Unfortunately the team at EA Bright Light had neither time nor experience.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Nintendo Insider,50,Putting it simply there is still fun to be had with FIFA 20 Legacy Edition and playing against others online is still a joy. Nevertheless charging full whack for a game when absolutely no effort went into is out of order. Simply ask yourself this are new kits and some roster changes worth over £40 to you? If you answered yes then you have too much money.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameSpy,60,Youll have to deal with a clunky interface and menu silly single-player missions brain-dead A.I. bizarre vehicle physics horrible net code dull graphics and sound and more bugs than a Georgia swamp in June.
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,PlayStation Universe,60,Spuds Unearthed has a lot of cool elements but they unfortunately don’t add up to a very compelling game. Plagued by overly complex interface elements and a very flimsy structure the core gameplay just isn’t interesting enough to keep players coming back for more.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,GRYOnline.pl,65,Hatred is a very playable game for fans of adrenaline and bloody thrills although the content of the game is a bit controversial. The game could be longer more diverse and better optimized (Unreal Engine 4 is hungry for power). And given the overall quality Hatred did not deserve all the media buzz surrounding its development and most likely it wont be remembered in a few years time.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,AceGamez,50,Flushed Away isnt a terrible game but it does nothing to encourage me to go and see the film again and tarnishes what is easily one of the funniest films of the year.
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Everyeye.it,60,A clear step backwards compared to its predecessor.
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,VideoGamer,60,The gameplay works but the simple presentation and general lack of polish unfortunately relegate the game to something only a very small minority will enjoy.
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Vandal,56,A disappointing game that although succeeds in being a game for all types of public is too repetitive and has a very limited cooperative gameplay.
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,IGN,45,So dont bother volunteering for any extra chores around the house to earn money for this one. You might have more fun just actually mowing the yard.
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,65,Unfortunately the end result is a little more Rambo a lot less Rocky. Its going to take a rethinking to pull the 3D brawler out of its me too phase and Streetwise certainly isnt helping.
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,AceGamez,60,Zathura isnt a particularly bad title; it just lacks anything that puts it above most other recent releases.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Everyeye.it,60,The most interesting feature is in fact the cross save that allows you to play indifferently on Switch or mobile devices.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,NintendoWorldReport,50,If youre thirsting for some Pac-Man partying Id go out and find the Wii version as its more accessible and for petes sake the game was clearly designed for the Wii.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,PSM3 Magazine UK,61,Slow-witted camera idiotic targeting system and abysmal vehicle sections. [Oct 2009 p.82]
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,Games Master UK,57,Some good ideas and lush graphics marred by bad game design. [Apr 2007 p.66]
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,Push Square,50,Super Dungeon Bros is a strange case. Its a pretty good dungeon crawler with decent variety in its gameplay and enough of a fun factor in its scrappy multiplayer to keep you interested. However the rock theme is underplayed; it lends the game some personality but is largely ignored leading to a muddled presentation. Some bugs also hold it back and the online side isnt very healthy right now but this could still be a fun distraction in couch co-op with a few friends.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,XGN,60,While Omerta has a great gangster style with the black and white photos and jazz music the gameplay itself feels more like work than playing a videogame. The animations in the fighting scenes are stiff and the only thing that changes when your influence on Atlantic City grows are the emblems above the houses. All missions start up slow and especially in the first few hours you are constantly waiting for your henchmen to finish their task.
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,Pocket Games,60,A so-so system that doesnt offer enough action to counter the lack of depth. [Summer 2003 p.49]
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GameSpot,55,Things just dont feel quite right and even if you like the controls the AI still cheats too much the same boring combinations still lead to wins and crowd involvement still takes precedence over inherent skill.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Vandal,55,This new Star Wars videogame doesnt make the most of the new generation power but also is a boring and dull action game with no variety in its contents.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,LaPS4,68,Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z gets to the point: action zombies and katanas for hackn slash lovers delight. Team Ninja and comcept managed to avoid making a boring game although Yaiba is perhaps quite short and suffers from a lack of variety.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GotNext,50,Even with a solid multiplayer though theres no reason for Americas Army: True Soldiers to be priced and marketed in the same class as other AAA FPS games available on the Xbox 360.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,60,It is a shame that the game is not as good as the movie it is based on. This is a simple and repetitive shooter that offers little incentive for those players who dont follow the adventures of the young wizard.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Worth Playing,50,It is a great disappointment that The Golden Compass for the NDS should be so sub-par.
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,63,Quite why they didnt simply make a new Myst specifically for the DS is the real mystery. [Feb 2008 p.84]
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,JeuxActu,65,If youre coming here for the gameplay forget Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 as nothing has evolved on that topic for the last decade. If you want to peep at sexy girls youre in the right place as everything was made with this goal in mind. A game to store on the ecchi shelf.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,God is a Geek,65,It’s largely the same hilarious gory surgery sim you know and love but its mechanics dont translate well to VR.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameSpot,58,Playing Exotica requires very little skill or finesse but for the casual gamer who doesnt want to commit lots of time to racing a track thats not really a bad thing.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Game Informer,58,Movement feels floaty hit detection and collision issues are everywhere and enemy AI is painfully stupid. [Jan 2005 p.118]
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Generación Xbox,50,With the original premise of being able to use the hordes of zombies in your favor to massacre on the enemy comes Dead Alliance. A competitive shooter in which you can test your reflexes and ability as long as you can overlook their technical and visual impairments.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,AceGamez,60,You are indeed going to need a Will of Steel to play this game merely because it takes tremendous patience to put up with terrible AI.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,LaPS4,58,Aliens are back in the videogame scene. However this game does little justice to the film series and lags behind in technical aspects when compared to other current titles. Nonetheless the different game modes –competitive and cooperative– will guarantee the fun that the solo campaign is lacking.
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,MondoXbox,55,It sports the charismatic characters from the movie but lacks in variety and player satisfaction. Avoidable.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,9Lives,59,Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes looks like a previous-gen title and doesnt convince content-wise either. A lousy camera stubborn controls make the eternal stream of lives a must. It feels kiddy and your friends AI is so bad that you thank the heavens for its co-op ability. With the sheer volume of hit games coming we fear that Lucas wont be able to find a lot of gamers willing to purchase this game.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,GameSpot,60,The Xbox Live Arcade release of Tron hobbles this absolute arcade classic with some technical problems.
Farscape: The Game,PC,Aug-8-2002,Red Lemon Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer,63,A must-have for hardcore fans of the show (both of them). But for anyone else itll just be a very boring extra-long episode. [Nov 2002 p.122]
Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,AceGamez,60,A disappointment considering that the Xbox PS2 and GBA versions are so much fun to blaze through.
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,Everyeye.it,57,This gardening themed spin-off carries over all the issues with the main chapter of Cooking Mama. Theres no depth in the minigames and player progression and that doesnt help an overall uninteresting offer.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Gamereactor Denmark,50,It feels as though all creativity and imagination has been shunned during development and the result is a load of lethargic combat with too many flaws and complete lack of the details and polish that define the best games of the genre.
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine,65,And while the game is generally fun its strictly for casual arcade racing-style fans. [Jan 2008 p.69]
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameZone,57,If you have to see what its about for yourself rent it before purchasing and above all else… find a friend.
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,SpazioGames,60,Naughty Bear is an amazing character in an average game. Some technical flaw and some dull mechanic ruins the appeal of the game.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Thunderbolt,60,Its at times a blissful experience and at times a total joy but at others its frustrating and shallow.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,PSX Nation,60,Supercross 2000 is just bland. The game lacks real variety.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GamesRadar+,50,While far from the worst Transformers game Rise of the Dark Sparks interesting ideas are eclipsed by bland action and frustrating design.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hobby Consolas,68,Good ideas and a fun artistic approach for a game which is sometimes boring.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,SpazioGames,50,RollerCoaster Tycoon World is a pale shadow of the past RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The rollercoaster editor works well but it is also the only good element of the game.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,DarkStation,60,Unless you’re dying for a game set in Vietnam there’s no great need to play this.
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,70,A surprisingly good instalment. Well worth a look if you see it for 20 quid or so. [Apr 2011 p.90]
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,61,Its rubbish fun. [Mar 2010 p.94]
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Gameplanet,55,NBA Live 14 delivers an unambitious sporadically exciting basketball simulation held back by its slavish adherence to replicating the televised game.
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Worth Playing,50,So yeah if you have an option skip the PS2 version for the 360 copy.
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpy,60,Chronicles has some of the most unresponsive controls Ive experienced in a long time.
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Games Master UK,50,Theres no denying that it has enough tournament action to keep easily pleased fans happy. [Oct 2012 p.92]
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,SpazioGames,60,Naughty Bear is an amazing character in an average game. Some technical flaw and some dull mechanic ruins the appeal of the game.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,55,We find a bunch of good ideas crashing among them. Its hard to recommend this game but we really hope they find the way to make it work in a possible sequel.
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Gaming Target,60,Not all of them are hits; however there are a couple of gems that deserve being rediscovered.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,55,The game lacks variety but it also doesnt outstay its welcome. If you want some laughs and dont mind that the shooting experience is average at best playing through this alien invasion is probably more entertaining than the movie and youll get some Achievements/Trophies out of it.
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameCritics,65,With its minimalist aesthetic and focus on customization and combat at the expense of all else Rengoku might leave a lot of curious PSP owners cold. But for those gamers looking for something a little further afield than the latest racing or sports update this niche experience is most definitely worth looking at.
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,Game Over Online,64,The game is flat-out broken right now and unlike Matt Hardy I don’t think the lake of reincarnation can help it. It needs some time to be fixed up and lots of it. Fortunately 2K through their WWEGames Twitter account maintains that patches are coming in the next few weeks – so if those come out and fix things up grab the game then. Until then you can safely skip 2K20 and it’s a shame because conceptually it’s got a lot of improvements – but the final product just doesn’t live up to its potential.
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,XGN,50,Mindjack teaches us that a good concept doesnt always evolve into a good game. Square Enix should really think about all the mistakes theyve made if they ever want to create a successor.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Eurogamer Italy,50,Enki is presented as a repeatable horror experience but fails both the repeatable and the horror parts. The publicized randomization system affects just the displacements of key objects and the whole experience is over in about 50 minutes far less than the price point of 10 Euros my suggest.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Game Informer,50,If theres a legend here its that this title fails to raise your heartbeat in almost any way. [Mar 2002 p.79]
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Dreamcast.net,59,Has everything needed for a great game but unfortunately fails to produce in the end.
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Games Master UK,57,A compelling enough adventure spoilt by shonky controls and shonkier visuals. [Feb 2011 p.93]
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,SpazioGames,55,We feel sorry to see that a great publisher like Namco Bandai in possession of a good license such as One Piece produced such a mediocre title which will be attractive only to the hardcore fans of the series and especially the younger among them.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,BonusStage,69,Where Game Tycoon falters is in its lack of depth and variety. Although the concept and myriad of options I described in the paragraph above are intriguing there isn’t a whole lot to it beyond clicking check boxes on the screen and managing company economics.
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,60,The chaotic levels are challenging but they become far too repetitive far too quickly.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,3DJuegos,56,Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime is recommended only for the lovers of the films with friends to play. The AI is frustrating the design really poor and repetitive. This time the Ghostbusters have failed.
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cynamite,60,The imprecise controls bad AI and a completely missing overview make this game more hassle than fun. Stormrise raises a storm – of frustration!
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GamesBeat,59,An unoriginal example of an archaic form of entertainment.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Meristation,68,A funny and interesting game based on Touhou characters which as a fighting game is really curious but lacks on its rooster with only 9 characters and contents to maintain interest on it.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Chronicles,57,A mild diversion rather than the full-blown stealth spy-thriller it could have been. At times I had fun but most of the time I was turned off by the frustrating gameplay and slow pacing of the action.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Computer Gaming World,50,Has the potential to be a truly unique sim but its got the blocky aesthetics of an edutainment title yet is too complex for junior to play on his own. [Sept 2002 p.85]
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,Four Fat Chicks,75,Still if you like sweet genteel heroes who absolutely cannot die and humorous third-person adventure games filled with inventory puzzles and devoid of gore its certainly worth the price of admission.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,Game Informer,60,The framerate chugs from time to time and the controls feel looser than the strippers at the Bada Bing. Still the story and dialogue had me laughing out loud a few times. If you are a big fan of the show it is worth a look but don’t expect much.
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,65,Unfortunately the end result is a little more Rambo a lot less Rocky. Its going to take a rethinking to pull the 3D brawler out of its me too phase and Streetwise certainly isnt helping.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,63,The game is a much better rental or title that is best left to borrowing from a friend who was fooled into buying it due to their ‘80’s nostalgia.
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,COGconnected,55,The whole affair feels sort of perfunctory.
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Nintendo Life,50,Block Factory is an attempt to do something different and it manages it competently while using some of 3DS functionality well. However more than anything its a greatest hits package of some existing block-dropping games with creation options that feel limited. With more fleshed out customisation even on a stylistic level alone it could have been something much bigger than it is.
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,3DJuegos,58,A so-so JRPG with neat ideas and a unique graphical conception but it also has lots of technical problems and annoying battles too.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Detroit Free Press,75,The things I liked about the game overwhelmed what I didnt like. If you want a high score you cant be a stiff. You have to get into the groove and use your whole body.
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,ZTGD,65,Still if you can stick with it and become accustomed to the way you are forced to rely on instinct there is a pretty fun and solid game here. The barrier to entry is just too high to recommend it to everyone.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,GamingTrend,62,Given a year or so Archlord might be a solid title. Right now though? Its not worth the money.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Nintenderos,59,The game is a failed attempt to bring back this mythical saga. The title innovates with several game modes that are affected by its bad gameplay and input lag. Also noteworthy is its poor graphic section and its acceptable sound section.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Digital Chumps,55,Graphically the game looks quite dated. The music is well bad — and the effects while capturing some of the characters’ uniqueness is still pretty flat. Likewise in general for the game while there is some fun to be had especially in local multiplayer the overall experience is more underwhelming than not. That makes this game very difficult to recommend to all but the most ardent kart racing or Nickelodeon fans. Even within those camps who are more apt to overlook flaws with NKR the experience leaves a lot to be desired.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,52,A dark fantasy adventure stripped of darkness fantasy and well adventure. [July 2009 p.71]
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,netjak,57,The concept is all there but some features such as funds management background story and sounds are only half-baked and appear as if the developers lost interest in completing the title.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,The fact that the game attempts to surpass the standard tie-in speaks volumes. [Issue#60 p.96]
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,GameZone,55,Brave is obviously designed with children new to gaming in mind but even they shouldn’t tolerate this glitchy mess. There’s a pretty good game here hiding amongst the bugs graphical issues and poorly designed platforming sequences. It’s called Brave: Search for Spirit Dancer and you can find it for a very reasonable price for the PS2.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Official Xbox Magazine,65,If you dont mind solo workouts Zumba Fitness delivers in spades. [Jan 2011 p.79]
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Da Gameboyz,56,Overall Turning Point: Fall of Liberty is game which had some fantastic ideas and concepts. Unfortunately the great ideas did not transform into a solid shooter.
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,63,As far as mini-games on Wii go Family Party: 30 Great Games is an above average effort. That may not be saying much but if youre looking for something to entertain your friends on occasion you certainly could do a whole lot worse.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,58,Its impossible to recommend as a purchase due to a handful of flaws that have a major negative impact on the gameplay. At On the same token its bursting with great platforming ideas that rival gamings top franchises. If youre curious we suggest a rental but beware of inevitable frustration.
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,BaziCenter,55,Jujubee S.A.’s efforts in creating a different narrative style is admirable and they did a great job in designing a solid atmosphere and a dynamic environment. But when it comes to presenting a video game inspired by real historical events KURSK falls a little bit short and besides that the core gameplay is not really entertaining either.
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Xbox Tavern,61,Hello Neighbor is a confused game that doesn’t do much to entice those that are new to the experience. There’s a lack of structure in both the story and the gameplay. This alone makes much of the pace rely heavily on trial and error and although there’s a wide variety of different puzzles to work out the delivery of each of them can be mind boggling if you miss out on a single detail.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,GameZone,69,Steel Horizon works well as a mainstream DS release but does not have the intransigent components of a cutthroat strategy game. Its combat is too simplistic.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,60,Part of me feels the need to defend this game as I find myself almost feeling sorry for it. Its like a well-meaning kid that because of inadequate parents didnt get the break it deserves.
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,3DJuegos,64,Rock Revolution is basically what you’d expect from a musical game at medium level.
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Multiplayer.it,50,Like the original version MX vs ATV Supercross Encore is really boring and the lack of innovation makes it quite pointless.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,Game Chronicles,55,With Fatal Conspiracy it is as if Telltale forgot what made Sam & Max Monkey Island and Wallace and Gromit so successful in the console world and it comes off as a sorry port of a lackluster PC game.
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,NZGamer,60,The visuals are generally clean and bright while the audio is made up of your generic menu music and a series of beeps and tones when instructed to move or perform a certain action.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,PSFocus,68,The television series is great but the game isn’t. The main aspects are stealth gameplay fighting and quick time events. Only the stealth part works in this game the other two don’t. The graphics are nice and the audio is fine. The voice-acting could have been better but overall it’s good to listen to.
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,Electronic Gaming Monthly,55,You can drop a few quarters at the local arcade or half a Benjamin for the home version and still beat the game in one sitting. [June 2002 p.120]
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Happy Puppy,50,The graphics may be lackluster but the music is worse.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Games Master UK,56,Middle-of-the-road DS gaming thats not offensive or horrible - just not very good. [May 2007 p.83]
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,TotalPlayStation,50,ArcaniA has an expansive world to explore. Unfortunately theres almost nothing of interest to find there and youll likely leave unsatisfied.
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Game Chronicles,65,A lack of imagination in terms of game mechanics doomed it to the rental bin and not the permanent collection.
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,SomosXbox,60,With a great base that reminds Top Spin Tennis World Tour presents more errors than they should with a game that seems in progress.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,AtomicGamer,60,A hastily made not much fun not worth the money movie add-on. Youre better off buying a box of Hellboy Cornflakes.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,3DAvenue,60,The problem with Spiderman 2 is its lack of depth.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Gamer's Pulse,66,While the actually gameplay is without much issue it borrows heavily from other games particularly the Rogue Squadron series making its mission-based gameplay highly unoriginal and trite.
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,Gaming Nexus,58,Iron Man 2 is better than your average movie game but its still rather short and limited in scope. The visuals are great and the controls work well but I have a feeling HVS couldve done a lot more with the property if they had more time to work on the game.
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,360 Gamer Magazine UK,50,Winter Sports 2009 simply does the job. It is easy to play and offers a fair amount of entertainment – and at a welcome bargain price that will appeal to many sports fans. However with poor presentation values and only a handful of really fun or challenging events it’s a game you’ll be unlikely to dig out on a regular basis unless you’ve an unquenchable thirst for competition or a few mates up for some multiplayer action.
Deca Sports 3,Wii,Oct-26-2010,Hudson | NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Sports | General | General,Nintendojo,58,There is some fun to be had in Deca Sports 3 and its a sure-fire hit at parties. Not a hard-core sports simulator but some lesser-known sports that dont get the full retail package are also nice to find here.
Rugby 18,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Koch Media,Sports | Team | Rugby,Gameblog.fr,50,Rugby 2018 is lacking the depth to reach the level of the best sports games.
Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,eToychest,70,My advice: Set aside a larger budget for voice acting and make sure the environments are as interactive toward the end as they are in the beginning. For players dont expect a classic because you wont find this game fulfilling that need. But as long as you set your expectations a bit lower you should be entertained.
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,Yahoo!,70,The lack of a mid-game save aside PoA is great fun to play - not only does it have the necessary hook to keep you interested in what happens next but it manages to perfectly reproduce the atmosphere of the Apes films.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,52,A twisted shrine to mediocrity. [Aug 2010 p.104]
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,Game Informer,50,My time with Wayward Manor felt more like a trial than a macabre puzzle adventure about a haunted house. Wayward Manor isn’t frightening but it sure scared me away.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GameSpot,50,A lot of little flaws suck most of the fun out of this take on radio-controlled car racing.
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,Eurogamer,50,American Football fans looking for a cheap retro fix will probably squeeze 400 points worth of fun out of Cyberball before déjà vu sets in but the absence of any real multiplayer challenge means any amusement comes with a built-in expiry date one that arrives sooner than youd like. Its no Speedball thats for sure.
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,70,Transformers is a funny rail shooter with nice graphics and four different weapons you can use to shot your enemies during two available campaigns. The problem is the game is way too easy as you can finish it in a few hours. It also lacks any form of progression or power-ups.
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,VGPub,64,If you have Live this can be an incredibly enjoyable game once you get used to the profane and immature nature of players that frequent the lobbies.
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,GameStar,58,Its very short but we still had to force ourselves to play on. Dumb non-stop battles oversized dungeons and a tiring story is basically all there is. Think twice before buying this one.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Vandal,65,Because of the wide RPG library in PS2 and PSP and sspecially in PS2 during his ten years of life Mana Khemia can sneak modestly between hardcore Atelier Iris fans. There are not many surprises in this game which is too conservative but can offer some hours of fun.
Damnation,PC,May-22-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameStar,58,Technically Damnation is not up to date it looks like a game from the 20th century with overly complicated controls. Its a shame because it could have been so much better. Blue Omega please try again.
One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,GamingTrend,60,One Way Trip is the story of a definite and unjust death sentence told amongst an eerily realistic dissociative drug trip backdrop that freaked my delicate mind more than once. Basic disjointed and tragic this game strips away almost all functions of a game and makes you a decision maker. Plagued with crashes that can cause fatal errors One Way Trip does have some improvements to make. With those improvements and time One Way Trip is sure to become a cult favorite of the PlayStation 4 age.
Alien Blast: The Encounter,PC,Feb-9-2004,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Game Chronicles,60,Aliens Blast: The Encounter never makes any pretense toward being anything other than it is a simple straightforward shoot ‘em up extravaganza and depending upon whether or not this is your cup of tea will be the major factor in your purchase decision.
Robot Arena,PC,Apr-1-2001,Gabriel Interactive,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Breeding/Constructing,IGN,43,While its prettier than most budget titles it also suffers from the vacancy that so often comes with nice looking people dogs or mechanical monsters. It looks great standing still but give it a complicated task and it all goes to pieces.
Rally Challenge 2000,Nintendo 64,Jun-30-2000,Europress,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,IGN,60,Its not a miserable game by any stretch -- the bad fogging can be worked around the sad audio can be drowned out without missing anything and the lacking tracks are at least true to the sport.
Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,n-Revolution Magazine UK,60,More suited to a younger audience. It wears thin after a while but cheap thrills can easily tempt you back. [Issue#25 p.77]
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,Absolute Games,62,7554 deserves brownie points for trying to break the mold. Instead of the overused US invasion of 1965 the developers chose 1954 – the final year of the First Indochina War. Too bad this is the only original idea in the entire game. 7554 is just a carbon copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare sans multiplayer.
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Pelit (Finland),58,A poor excuse for a racing game. The only good thing is the wheel that comes with the game. Using it is actually quite fun. [Jan 2007]
Timeline,PC,Nov-12-2000,Timeline Computer Entertainment,Action | General | General,GameSpy,56,Sadly much of the game feels as if it were rushed and the games story and characters are presented so poorly as to all but ruin what could have an enjoyable experience.
MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,Extreme Gamer,56,Ubisoft had great hopes and ambition when planning and creating MotionSports Adrenaline but when an fast paced extreme sports game has unresponsive controls it leaves you feeling very let down and frustrated.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Wii,Nov-16-2010,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,60,As movie tie-ins go this is a decent effort - but youd need to have downed your body weight in butter-beer to claim that it didnt need a little more care attention and (perhaps) experience in its creation.
The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Xbox Magazine,60,Theres no reason to play The Golden Compass unless the movie or book absolutely monopolizes your imagination. [Jan 2008 p.62]
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Destructoid,50,Gungrave like when it debuted over a decade ago is an acquired taste.
Waking,PC,Jun-18-2020,Jason Oda,Action | General,TheGamer,70,Waking probably wont resonate with most - its far too oblique and mixed for most and its complicated art for weirdos. But as one of those weirdos I found Jason Odas unique thesis on life death and everything between the two to be an engaging engrossing and challenging experience.
JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,Trickstar Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,50,From the first mission to the last J.A.S.F. is left to rot by the arcadey and capable Ace Combat for sheer thrills embarrassed by the variety of missions offered in H.A.W.X. 2 and technically outperformed by the more serious IL-2 Sturmovik. [February 2012 p.76]
Taito Legends Power-Up,PSP,May-17-2007,Empire Oxford,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Boomtown,60,Cheap cheerful and a good laugh even if it does lack a little longevity.
Rapala Tournament Fishing!,Wii,Nov-22-2006,MagicWand,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Electric Playground,50,Rapala Tournament Fishings controls just arent intuitive and worse theyre not especially responsive.
DARK,PC,Jul-3-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Multiplayer.it,55,DARK is a stealth game with some nice ideas and an interesting story but it suffers from poor IA and repetitive gameplay.
Seduce Me,PC,Jan-2-2013,None,Strategy | General | General,NZGamer,54,My main issue with Seduce Me is that despite the invitation that is right there in the title of the game none of the characters want to cooperate. No matter how high your score with a character - and hence your implied closeness to that character - they still play as though they want you to fail.
Lets Fish! Hooked On,PlayStation Vita,Jan-29-2013,SIMS,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Gaming Age,50,Considering it has no competition… Lets Fish! Hooked On is surely the best fishing game available for the PlayStation Vita and fans of the genre (like myself) may enjoy it for a little while. Even with the Vitas bells and whistles however it fails to live up to the Sega-style arcade fishing games of old.
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,PC,Oct-17-2006,Apeiron,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | General | Modern,Armchair Empire,50,My instinct is that despite BE5’s flaws it might have potential for modding or for higher quality sequels.
Turtle Tale,3DS,May-22-2014,Saturnine Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Life,50,At its low price point Turtle Tale is an entirely functional platforming adventure from a small indie studio that you can breeze through in a day or two.
Street Supremacy,PSP,Feb-28-2006,Genki,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Game Informer,68,The structure is here for a great title but it doesnt help when half the games gone up in smoke. [Apr 2006 p.135]
Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,Cheat Code Central,62,The game will be delightfully nostalgic to gamers of old and should be tried by anyone who is too young to remember it. Its an important part of gaming history one that will make a fine addition to your Xbox LIVE Arcade game collection.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Game Informer,63,Nothing more than an unpolished but promising rhythm title. [Feb 2004 p.103]

007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,PSX-Sense.nl,60,A fun shooter collecting the best moments out of five classic James Bond movies on one disc. Then again the gameplay has aged the graphics are terrible and both loading times and enemy AI are major disappointments. There are better alternatives on the shooter market thats for sure.
Mall Tycoon,PC,Feb-3-2002,Holistic Design | Inc.,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,47,Building your own galleria is fun for a bit but because its such a simple economic simulation theres just no staying power here.

Clash of the Titans,PlayStation 3,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Play UK,65,It isnt great but its quite a fun distraction and far better than most other movie-games. [Issue#193 p.95]
0 Day Attack on Earth,Xbox 360,Dec-23-2009,Gulti,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,My Gamer,58,While the concept of the game seems to be sound a Geometry Wars inspired co-op shooter; everything seems to work against it especially the price.
Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,52,A twisted shrine to mediocrity. [Aug 2010 p.104]
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,Screen Rant,50,Dollhouse begins with a lot of potential but after a few levels of repetitive gameplay the horror elements start to lose their impact. What starts as a trip through a disturbed mind quickly becomes monotonous and Maries story suffers as a result.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Game Over Online,60,This game is aggressive and unstoppable in its mediocrity.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,NF Magazine,50,In the end Nickelodeon Kart Racers is just kind of passable (and compared to others Im being generous with it). [Issue #37 – January/February 2019 p. 75]
Way of the Dogg,Xbox 360,May-3-2013,Echo Peak,General | Action | General,Destructoid,55,Way of the Dogg is a wasted opportunity. As someone who consumes pretty much all the media on offer in this game it doesnt even appeal to me which should tell you that somethings wrong. Its a shame because with an M rating and a little more plot tweaking this could have been something special. Someone call the popo -- this game just did a 187 on your wallet foo.
4PM,PC,Jul-9-2014,Bojan Brbora,Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,VideoGamer,50,The brain behind (Bojan Brbora) 4PM deserves a lot of credit for what he has attempted to achieve but when all is said and done this feels more like a proof of concept than a fully realised game.
WWII Aces,Wii,Mar-21-2008,Arcade Moon,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Game Chronicles,50,This is a third-party game with not very high aspirations. Don’t let the Wing Series emblem on the cover fool you into thinking that it is official or historically accurate or anything of the sort.
Delta Force: Xtreme 2,PC,May-27-2009,NovaLogic,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,Thunderbolt,50,Xtreme 2 succeeds as a budget game - it just doesn’t cater to any audience in particular. A lack of focus is the overarching problem with this decent budget title.
Slain!,PC,Mar-24-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,4Players.de,55,The discrepancy between visual and game design couldn’t be bigger. While the pixelart is simply beautiful throughout the fighting mechanics and collision detection need an overhaul.
Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Riot Pixels,48,It is hardly a spy thriller but rather a madhouse with disguises and murders so it’s best to avoid this chapter of Mr. Strogov’s life altogether.
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,NintendoWorldReport,70,Its a cleverly designed game that could use a bit more polish.

Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,Cheat Code Central,60,The only adventure youll have with it is trying to get your money back should you be so unlucky to have purchased it.
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Happy Puppy,50,If you havent seen the game prepare to witness some of the weakest graphics this side of the millenium. The 3D characters are nothing but big blocks of pixel.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,GamingXP,48,Naval Assault – The killing tide should have been an arcade game. It would have been a good advice to 505 Games to do so. But they decided to release it as a full-price game. But for this it is too simple and its gameplay is too stupid.
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,Gaming Nexus,65,With so many great ideas in The Chaos Engine it pains me to admit that I didnt have much fun. I love the world it creates the diverse enemies and the science fiction story but cant get past the punishing difficulty and cheap hits. This enhanced version needs a few more enhancements to be ready for the 21st century!
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendo Power,60,The gamplay is simple but well-executed and just as much fun as it was in the eraly 80s. [June 2004 p.121]
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,Computer and Video Games,50,Its banality is perfect. Even an inexplicable side-scrolling fish-tank shoot-em-up level that pops up between the soporific platform stages fails to raise an eyebrow.
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,DC Swirl,60,Theres plenty to enjoy about Ducati Racing which ultimately picks up for all of the minor gripes.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,ZTGD,65,I felt there was very little content here to keep me coming back other than the novel feeling of the bow and arrow which is absolutely amazing in fact. Aside from this and maybe the visual style I don’t see a huge reason I’d return to it especially if other games adopt this bow and arrow feel. Yet at the same time I can’t complain it’s a simply game with colorful graphics and is appropriate for players of all ages. Just don’t expect it to kill hours of time.
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,Gamers Depot,60,It’s not that it’s that bad of a game it’s just that most of what’s under the hood on this one has been done before.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,ZTGD,60,While most will likely balk at the idea of spending 800 Microsoft Space Bucks for this title I find it quite refreshing and reminiscent of the PSOne days where devs took chances on titles that didn’t really fit a genre.
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Play (Poland),60,Vietnam veteran Joey Verolla is a really really tough guy who can not only lift two kalashnikovs but also fire them simultaneously. And he does this trick with any other handgun even SPAS. If it doesnt properly impress his enemies its because they are brainless. As is the entire game - despite some interesting mission designs quite amusing (and gory) finishing sequences and virtually useless ability to seek cover by putting your back to the wall this shooter is as simple as some precursors of the genre. [March 2008]
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Nintendo Life,50,Chronus Arc is competent RPG that fails to deliver on one of the most important aspects of the genre: the story.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Revolution,50,Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DONT KNOW! does a great job of managing and working with the story characters and feel of the franchise but unfortunately doesnt have the gameplay to match especially at a $40 retail price. If youre interested in the narrative and the chance to play as your favorite characters wait for the price to come down to $15-20 more in keeping with the kind of downloadable title this game feels like.
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,ZTGD,53,However if you are a fan of classic arcade driving games like Segas aforementioned cabbie title then you may want to check Mayhem out. It can definitely entertain even if only for minutes at a time.
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,IGN,54,Protothea is a totally hardcore shooter that while challenging just isnt very interesting. The one unique aspect is its control scheme but I cant say its an improvement over two analog sticks. The game doesnt look that great doesnt sound that great and doesnt offer much creativity.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Chronicles,57,How much you enjoy that gameplay is going to be based on your love of the genre and your tolerance for numerous glitches. Hopefully a patch is in the works to improve things or at least fix what’s broke.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GameStar,53,The sequel to the controversial Vietnam first person shooter abandoned the use of torture and atrocities to civilians. It also abandoned good graphics atmosphere and almost everything else needed for a good game. Dumb enemies exaggerated splatter effects boring levels and graphics right from the last century - Shellshock 2 has nothing interesting to offer.
Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,AceGamez,50,With presentation thats lacking flair no tournament options sub-standard opponent AI no rule variations other than 8 or 9 ball pool and limited stimuli to continue playing Frontline Studios appear to have just gone through the motions with Actua Pool.
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpy,73,If you enjoy puzzle-oriented RPGs or the Freedom series you might enjoy this game. Otherwise it should stay on the shelf.
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Play Magazine,50,This sequel simply didnt need to happen. [June 2007 p.80]
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Games Master UK,55,Fans will get a kick out of it but anyone else would be advised to try the glorious cartoon instead. [Jan 2014 p.83]
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,45,Xiaolin Showdown has the elements of a good game but the execution is so sloppy and shallow that it ends up falling flat.
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,50,Painkiller Hell & Damnation is a short unattractive beast that will sink its claws into you if you give it half a chance. But be warned: it could also be a throwback that may fly right over the head of a modern FPS gamer. [September 2013 p76]
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,PSX-Sense.nl,50,Fans of farming might enjoy this but if youre not particularly fond of agriculture we wouldnt recommend this game. To be sure its an incredibly deep experience but sheer depth does not prevent a title like this from growing stale within a couple of hours. Repetitive gameplay outright bizarre physics and mediocre visuals dont help either.
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,IGN Italia,60,Escape Dead Island is a decent game but nothing more (though also nothing less).
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Meristation,45,Inner Chains has been a big opportunity wasted. Its true that its a relatively small indie studio that its a project with a very specific vision and that has really new features that are also great but the final result has more the look of an unfinished beta than a totally finished game.
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,A little bit ropey. [Issue#52 p.104]
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Game Informer,60,If you’re going to get one of these go for the faster-paced Beta Wave but watch out for that nasty addition game.
MTV Sports: Skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald,PlayStation,Sep-12-2000,Darkblack,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GameZone,70,Very entertaining.
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,48,Mamodo Fury packs a number of gameplay modes and plenty of familiar characters but it all feels wasted on this shallow and frustrating fighting game.
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,IGN,55,Just some generic cars running over some ho-hum zombies. The controls could be tighter and no one seems to be playing online but the game succeeds at giving you a license to run over the undead. It just isnt that exciting.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,GameFocus,60,Despite the stiff stealth/fighting mechanics the mission’s linearity and the trial/error experience Prison Break: The Conspiracy somehow ended up being enjoyable. I’m sure Zootfly could have done something much better but in the end the final product was purposely done with the intention of giving the fans something incredibly easy to play.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,47,The problems start with control. The response isnt razor sharp the special moves arent spectacular and the Netbuster specials are too easy to pull off. [Jan 2004 p.73]
Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu,Game Boy Advance,Nov-24-2003,Webfoot Technologies,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameBiz,65,It has its ups and downs but the special moves look absolutely gorgeous and very much like they do in the cartoon series and the in-flight fighting is an experience not to be missed on a hand-held.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,60,Brian and Stewie are funny and there are plenty of gags but the gameplay is nothing crazy and the levels arent super-intriguing.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Maxi Consolas (Portugal),50,As in many of these cases if you liked the movie you’ll probably enjoy revisiting the story and characters. But that doesn’t make it a good game. [Jan 2008]
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Hardcore Gamer,60,Had there been some polish in some of the controls an added depth to the story mode and more matchmaking online Scourge: Outbreak would have been one of the biggest downloadable surprises this year. Still for around $10 it’s worth playing — especially with friends.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,Worth Playing,60,As stated earlier MotionSports: Play For Real is more of a complementary title to Kinect Sports than a competitive one.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,GamePro,70,The gameplay boils down to a simplistic mix of platform jumping and enemy bashing with a good dose of item collection thrown in. It wont tax your reflexes or your brain which is why the game is perfect for younger gamers; players who grew up with the cartoons as I did will also experience a nice feeling of nostalgia as they play.
Real Steel,Xbox 360,Oct-12-2011,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Real Steals fisticuffs are a half step above the usual movie-based dreck but the constant rattle of a beggars tin cup in your face only grows more distasteful over time.
Soldier Elite,PC,May-29-2006,Metropolis Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,46,Soldier Elite wants very badly to be a stealth action game but it lacks any understanding of the subtlety and nuance that are essential to the genre.
Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,ZTGD,69,For what the game does it works relatively well. There are a few hitches here and there but it was never enough to have me quit playing the game. For a cheaper title you can definitely do a lot worse than Deep Black. If youre looking for a decent little shooter and dont mind a few inconsistencies here and there you might want to check this game out.
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,60,The game is thirty minutes long and costs ten dollars. Thats thirty three cents a minute to play this game. Youll get better value out of a psychic hotline.
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,Meristation,60,Montagues Mount promises a journey through the mind of a tortured man by the shores of an Irish island and endless emotions. Actually we got an adventure burdened by its design flaws and soft script although it has potential for the future.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,BonusStage,60,It follows the beloved storyline with a wonderful cinematic flair top-notch audio design colorful yet simple graphics and a basic set of gameplay mechanics. However a lacking of innovation and overall gameplay and graphical polish stunt the games full potential and leave it as a just-above-average title only fans of the material and/or genre will find any value in.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,GameSpot,42,Its an idea that has been tried before and done better.
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Xbox Magazine,55,Crusade sports some solid ideas (a cursed realm you can switch to on the fly is a neat concept that doesnt quite work) but sadly it suffers most from ho-hum pacing and rinse-repeat gameplay.
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Game Chronicles,56,I was left slightly underwhelmed and rather bored with the entire experience. Sure Ultimate Beach Soccer is new and different and that might be enough to get a few curious gamers to check it out but I doubt it will keep their interest for more than a day or two.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,50,Commentary will soon get on your tits. [Feb 2006 p.94]
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,IGN,50,The Wii controls add a thin veil to make you feel like youre not just mashing A the entire time but you are. This game is literally you punching as your favorite member of the Fantastic Four for hours on end.
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,Gaming Age,42,Unless you have a strange Transformers fetish it’s a game that you can easily skip.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,Deeko,70,While the control and gameplay are dead on the repetition and lack of story simply hurt.
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Daily Radar,50,When you consider the Army Men franchises extraordinary commitment to ordinariness then it shouldnt be a surprise that the game is so utterly banal.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PC,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Gamer 2.0,52,After playing through just a bit of Turning Point we were completely disappointed. The old feeling to it completely ruined the original concept.
25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gaming Target,60,There are a couple of interesting concepts included in the package (customization items for your online avatar are awarded for completing single-player secondary objectives) but the game as a whole never rises above mediocrity.
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gamer 2.0,52,A decent racer that doesn’t really do anything different enough to warrant passing on any of the quality racing experiences that the PSP offers.
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gamers' Temple,55,Doctor Who fans will get a lot out of the story and excellent voice acting and motion capture but only gamers with a high tolerance for frustration will find the fun buried in this one.
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Da Gameboyz,50,Although the visuals and sound are solid enough the gameplay fails as the racing view itself is very strange and the controls are too simplistic and too dull to make it an exciting game.
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,Forbes,65,While the team’s modest size is betrayed by the game’s myriad technical issues what they’ve attempted here is quite honestly laudable. Maybe they’d do well to view this as a functional blueprint for a future project that builds on the good work that’s been accomplished—I know I’ll be waiting for what’s next. Here’s hoping the bugs get patched out and that we eventually get a Troll and I sequel one that focuses on cleaner controls and a more emotionally engaging story.
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,GamingTrend,50,Senran Kagura Reflexions is an Ecchi dating sim game that in reality is a touching and squeezing simulator. The gameplay feels pervy at times and gets repetitive and boring fairly quickly. There are no visual issues and motion controls make things more interesting but it unfortunately isnt enough to make it entertaining.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,51,Nostalgia-seekers need not apply: this is easily outdone by the 13-year-old game from which it is derived. A shame. [Christmas 2012 p.111]
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Game Informer,60,If you’re going to get one of these go for the faster-paced Beta Wave but watch out for that nasty addition game. [Feb. 2007 p.111]
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,The games simplicity makes this a questionable choice for anyone over 8 but young kids will likely enjoy it. [Jan 2005 p.106]
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,4Players.de,58,Two worlds collide: On one side you get loads of bizarre enemies and hair-raising ideas. On the other you get frustrated by old-fashioned mission design poor AI and boring gunfights. Like Stewie says: Again! Again! I love repetition!
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Console Gameworld,57,Kids and adults will find themselves frustrated with bad camera angles and dimwitted Oompa Loompas.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Game Informer,58,You know the drill: extremely linear level designs that stitch together corridors open areas and dull objectives with all the refinement and subltlety of a drunken quilting circle. [Mar 2006 p.100]
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,God is a Geek,40,The Switch port has almost everything going wrong with poor visuals a higher price point than the other platforms and poor use of Switch specific features. In its current state you’re better off either buying it on another platform if you must have it or skip it altogether. I hope the developers can either improve the visuals through patches or work on.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,GamePro,50,This game just lacks in too many ways to cost this much. Should have just been a 400 point game.
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Nintendo Life,60,Its a shame its so brief (about the length of an actual horror film) so we cannot recommend paying full price but if you can get it for a budget price itll make for some frightening fun at your next party.
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,3DJuegos,59,Thor is a very basic game made only for fans of the film.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,45,As a game its just ok but there are some quite frustrating issues –as the cover system– that end up weakening the final experience.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,PC,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | Shooter | General | First-Person | Modern,GameStar,61,Its quite short. The credits were rolling after less than seven hours. The weak presentation is just as annoying as the question why the game deprives the player of lots of exciting situations. There are better games of the genre like Rainbow Six: Vegas.
Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamer's Pulse,50,Replay value of Scream Arena is low due to its repetitive yet enjoyable gameplay.
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,Quandary,80,The makers should be commended on another fine effort.
Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,Xbox 360,Feb-10-2009,Tamsoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,Game Informer,60,Its hard to know which is more laughable: Onechanbaras story of sisters who absorb zombie blood through their skin or the fact that this game is so shallow. [Apr 2009 p.81]
Tony Hawk's Motion,DS,Nov-18-2008,Creat Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Games Master UK,57,A shadow of its former success this is little more than a limited showcase for a peripheral. [Feb 2009 p.82]
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,Wii,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,1UP,42,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor isnt without its charms but its hard to believe that the younger target audience will wade through the difficulty spikes to see the convoluted narrative to its conclusion.
Cartoon Network Racing,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameDaily,60,Kids will probably love it too as well as some adults that enjoy Cartoon Networks shows and characters.
The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,NintendoWorldReport,45,The Deer God is a tough sell its visuals and music can’t help make this game any less frustrating. If you have a lot of time and more importantly a lot of patience maybe this game is good for you but as it stands I would stay clear.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,GameWatcher,57,The casual gamer won’t even dignify this with half a first glance it’s a game to remind yourself that there’s a big wide World out there and you’re missing it!
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,GameCube Europe,49,While not as bad as the majority of critics are reporting its certainly not worthy of a full price title.
Resident Evil: Survivor,PlayStation,Aug-30-2000,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,Games Radar,75,Brilliant. Youll certainly be having a bit of a laugh as well as being scared out of your pants.
Realms of Ancient War,PC,Oct-4-2012,Wizarbox,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,DarkZero,50,In conclusion Realms of War is a title that is on the lower side of average in the genre it exists in.
Inkheart,DS,Jan-12-2009,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | General | General,GamerNode,50,Not for veteran gamers. Truly engaging puzzle-solving and high quality presentation are absent from the game but its accessible control style and somewhat interesting plot make it at least playable.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,GameCrate,50,The visuals have their fair amount of issues the gameplay cant quite measure up between the frustrating missions and poorly placed slam technique and the online sessions need a serious overhaul. Its still playable and might be fun for devoted fans for the series but theres no question that a lot more polish couldve gone into Tony Hawks revival.
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,50,An expansive number of levels plenty of unlockable rewards and a variety of play options - all qualities which tend to make game compilations worth picking up in the first place - are noticeably lacking here.
Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,45,You might well opt to buy stat upgrades or temporary performance-boosting items instead for the sake of simple one-on-one multiplayer confrontations. But because stat upgrades make little difference in the field and you can carry only a single boost item at a time youre probably better off just playing something else altogether.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Nintendo Gamer,48,A pale imitation of a far more ambitious game Alone in the Dark on Wii is too higgledy-piggledy to satisfy. A handful of terrific highs cant make up for hours of lows. [Sept 2008 p.58]
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Nintendophiles,53,The graphics system works not too well but every level is playable and enjoyable if it weren’t for having to start over completely after each life.
Putty Squad,PlayStation 4,Mar-11-2014,System 3,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,50,Putty Squad is not a bad game and with the relative lack of titles currently released on the PlayStation 4 it does fill something of a void. Still platforming enthusiasts with PlayStation 4s do have access to Rayman Legends rendering it rather pointless to grab Putty Squad unless youre an absolute genre purist.
Motocross Mania 3,Xbox,Apr-27-2005,Deibus Studios,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,TeamXbox,50,The title features sub-par racing horrendous graphics lackluster audio and focuses far too much on the weapons gimmick.
Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Age,83,Even with the Crash Mode being a let down Burnout Legends is easily one of the best racers on the Nintendo DS. The fact that Criterion has put all the little nuances of the Burnout series in one little DS cart is amazing.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,Play UK,56,At best forgettable; at worst downright creepy. [Issue#192 p.89]
Battleship,Xbox 360,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Tactical,Destructoid,50,A title that isnt truly good or bad with aspects that can be fun at times yet which grow boring over the course of its 4 hour lifespan and ultimately it falls just short of being anything more than decidedly average.
Battle: Los Angeles,PC,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,55,The game lacks variety but it also doesnt outstay its welcome. If you want some laughs and dont mind that the shooting experience is average at best playing through this alien invasion is probably more entertaining than the movie and youll get some Achievements/Trophies out of it.
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,IGN,40,Its a bland and lifeless arcade shooter with repetitive gameplay and unnecessary 3D effects.
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,PC Gamer UK,56,Makes a one-man war against the armies of hell quite depressingly dull. [Christmas 2009 p.116]
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Game Over Online,50,It doesn’t feel like it’s finished and even if it were to be further refined it would just be a low-budget Gears of War-style shoot-‘em-up. There’s no reason to play it.
G.I. Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,Armchair Empire,70,I found the presentation technically impeccable but was not able to sufficiently overcome the difficulty in issuing orders and controlling the camera to derive a lot of enjoyment from the game.
Driven,PlayStation 2,Nov-6-2001,Bam Entertainment,Driving | Racing | Formula One,Game Informer,65,More fun than watching the movie that inspired it. Of course so is watching your inbred Uncle Eddie pick lint out of his navel. [Feb 2002 p.85]
Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,TeamXbox,50,When running properly Pimp my Ride is fun if you’re into the show but it will do little for the gearheads who are looking for something a little different in the racing genre. Snatch this one up if you’re really into the TV show Xzibit or outlandishly customizing cars.
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameZone,50,Nearly identical to a game that was released 3 years ago with almost minimal upgrades. Some aspects have even been taken out or downgraded.
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Games Master UK,53,Awkward design and stiff controls make Dark a royal pain in the... [Sept 2013 p.70]
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN Italia,45,A handful of interesting (although poorly developed) ideas are the only bright spots in a game that disappoints in almost every possible way. Sadly Terminal Reality offers one of the ugliest survival horror games ever.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Critical Hit,59,Intrinsic problems with some of the basics; collision detection dodgy camera and sloppy graphics ruin what could have been a far more polished experience.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,IGN,55,The repetitive enemies poor environment design and visual slowdown will turn you off so much that youd never give the franchise another chance.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Edge Magazine,50,Despite the aforementioned illusion of choice there is really only one pre-determined way to conquer a given mission each stealthy ability in reality a functional button-press to move the game along. [Apr 2007 p.87]
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Everyeye.it,50,Thor: God of Thunder is an ugly game. The gameplay mechanics do not work properly and a poor visual style subtends the entire walktrough. Boring is the only word to describe this tie-in.
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Multiplayer.it,50,Project Root connect the spirit of the classic shooter with hints of open world . But the result is too uneven because of the many flaws in graphics and game design. Its hard to recommend buying this title albeit at a fairly low price.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,GameZone,62,Solid visuals decent golf mechanics and a large assortment of prizes to collect will keep some gamers busy. The game just needs more courses and an expanded single-player mode to really make gamers come back for more.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,60,Mediocre. [Nov 2009 p.78]
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,Worth Playing,55,If you are hoping for an updated version of the exceptional Seven Kingdoms gameplay in Seven Kingdoms: Conquest you will be seriously disappointed.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Worth Playing,60,It just gets kind of boring watching the fights instead of participating in them.
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GameNow,58,Youre better off going with the pro. [Jan 2003 p.52]
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,NintendoWorldReport,50,Outbreak is sort of a fun mode but it does get old quickly and everything surrounding it is unexplained or prone to error messages and I can see it becoming kind of gross in a free-to-play way. Blades of Time is bad and you should not play it.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Planet Xbox 360,52,Rock Revolution is a disaster.
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,PSM3 Magazine UK,65,Faithful for fans low on thrills for everyone else. [July 2007 p.84]
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,COGconnected,55,All in all Heavy Fire: Red Shadow is a game that is easy to overlook and doesn’t really give you much reason not to. There’s fun to be had and it’s an easy way to waste a half hour but that’s really all you’ll be doing. With repetitive gameplay a strange storyline and a tone that oddly feels more like a recruitment video than anything else Heavy Fire seems like it probably should have stayed dormant. Seriously though if it does unlock a special invite to join the military someone please let me know!
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Weekly Famitsu,63,6 / 7 / 6 / 6 - 25 [Vol 788; 23 Jan 2004]
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,games(TM),50,Rather than being encouraged to play it often feels like Bandai Namco is actively discouraging you from Lost Swords. [Issue#148 p.124]
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Digital Chumps,45,Getting stuck in room-escape or point and click adventure games is par for the course sometimes but what DYING: Reborn does not have going for it is other strong qualities to keep things interesting and worth the effort. It wasn’t long before I resorted to a walkthrough once and then again as needed. I wasn’t compelled by the story the characters or the atmosphere. I didn’t feel any sense of tension or immersion with Mathew and his plight. The presentation of the game from graphics to on-screen font to voice-acting was very generic and lackluster too making the whole experience a struggle and not very enjoyable. Without a walkthrough I probably would not have pressed on because I just was not finding the experience worth my time and effort. If you really enjoy room escape games and puzzles DYING: Reborn at $20 or less might be worth a look but it’s hard to recommend otherwise.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Informer,55,Like a Quidditch player falling from a broomstick mid-match this installment loses all forward momentum and goes plummeting toward a faceplant at top speed.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,GameStar,49,The basic concept is solid but due to its bad implementation the game is almost a total write-off.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSM Magazine,55,Acme Arsenal has its fun moments but only if you dont think too hard. [Dec 2007 p.89]
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Happy Puppy,60,One of the deepest games ever created. Too bad all the time spent with the options couldnt have been devoted to gameplay instead.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,59,Unfortunately the inconsistent behavior of your recruits means youll spend more time fighting the interface than the Antichrist.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,1UP,42,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor isnt without its charms but its hard to believe that the younger target audience will wade through the difficulty spikes to see the convoluted narrative to its conclusion.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,PSX Nation,50,There is a brain-dead appeal to the desperate way Konami has reinvented its struggling ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding franchise into a Road Rash clone.
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IGN,65,Its a somewhat enjoyable romp though...its just not a very clean Star Wars title.
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,TotalGames.net,58,This is a fairly average title with no fresh direction and without a real challenge it won’t keep many Gameboy fanatics busy for long.
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Multiplayer.it,60,If youre a Kinect skeptic Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor will not change your mind. At all. Motion controls may work better or worse depending on the room but theyll never be accurate enough to let you survive an ambush.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,CGMagazine,50,The game is littered with fan service and was clearly made by people who love the property. In a way that’s what makes it so frustrating.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,GameZone,60,The new game is frustrating repetitive and not as memorable as the first.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Not an entirely awful virtual re-creation of the beautiful game. [Issue#61 p.95]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Informer,55,Like a Quidditch player falling from a broomstick mid-match this installment loses all forward momentum and goes plummeting toward a faceplant at top speed.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,VideoGamer,50,We expect something special from Far Cry and frankly Vengeance just isnt up to scratch. Like a Z-list celebrity leave this one in the jungle.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,FNintendo,40,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle has decent Arcade and Score Attack modes and the idea of playing the same plot with different characters is worthy of praise but the fights quickly become repetitive and dull its audiovisual component is a throwback to fifteen years ago and overall the game just feels uninspired.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,COGconnected,50,Whether it was the shoddy writing non-existent character development the floaty platforming physics or the combat mechanics that are often at odds with themselves Randall is the kind of game that is no more than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately that sum does not add up to a memorable experience.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GamerFeed,50,The latest entry in the once respectable ninja series is downright awful what with its lack of blood horrendous top down perspective and abominable story.
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,Armchair Empire,60,As a game its a little bit hard to recommend this especially considering that its basically just an assemblage of Flash-style games the kind you could play for free on a movie promo site.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,PC Zone UK,45,The bottom line is that these events while fairly dreary in reality simply have no place in a game. For all its production values and official licence ultimately youd have a more interactive experience playing with a yoyo while watching the Winter Olympics on the telly.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,Worth Playing,60,Ignoring all else in favor of the pool games themselves Pocket Pool is a fun pick-up-and-play pool title with more features and better controls than youd expect accessible to both pool fans and casual gamers alike.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,ZTGD,60,Speed Zone is not a terrible game as much as it is one that seems to try too hard to impress.
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GamePro,45,Coupled with the terrible combat the game is only 2 hours long.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,1UP,50,Its a surprisingly silent boring affair and youre probably better off just watching the ATHF clips with your pal or one of the four full episodes included on the disc (one of which has never been aired and is awesome).
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameZone,59,The control and camera bugs made it somewhat frustrating to keep trying to progress the enemy AI made it dull and too easy to battle the side quests were mostly silly and I didn’t want to do them.
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Nintendo Power,55,Just as the Legend of the Dragon TV series comes off as a faint echo of Dragon Ball Z The Game Factorys Wii adaptation serves as a reminder that it takes more than two battlers and an arena to make a memorable fighting game. [Aug 2007 p.84]
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GamePro,60,In the end though Quantum Theory bears the terrible imprimatur of the also-ran. While its a noble effort on Tecmo-Koeis part (this is after all their first foray into this genre) it just doesnt have that oomph that a killer action game hits you in the sensory cortex with.
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GameSpot,62,Fans of the genre can consider Land of the Babes a light snack between hearty meals.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Talk Xbox,55,If I was David Fincher right now I would be looking for the man or woman assigned to approve this project and making sure they never had a job again.
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Push Square,50,A depiction of hell that hasnt really been fully realised before Agony is marred by frustrating stealth sections and some poorly explained mechanics. The horrifying imagery is generally effective and the overall presentation manages to survive some glaring technical issues but this is very much an acquired taste in every sense of the word.
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,61,Despite showing enormous potential Crash Boom Bang! is hampered by dodgy controls and a testing user interface. Its disappointing because this could have been a great multiplayer game. [Christmas 2006 p.80]
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamerWeb Nintendo,65,As long as you don’t expect the fast pace and energy (not to mention multiplayer action) of it’s arcade and console counterparts you should have fun with this game.
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Gaming Age,58,Not that the game does anything bad it is as unoriginal as you can get in this land of competition.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,70,Enemy paths are obvious and at times theyll forget to shoot at you. Meanwhile youll die behind cover much too often requiring you to restart the whole level...If you can forgive these flaws Blackwater is old-school arcade fun and a solid step in making a hardcore Kinect game.
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,Nintendophiles,80,A landmark title with gameplay better than ever before and great play mechanics that defy portable gaming.
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,Vandal,60,Left Alive has many good ideas. Some of them are well-executed and many others are not. It’s a shame that many of these issues are on the gameplay side but if you really like the concept you can manage to enjoy it.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,TotalGames.net,55,A distinct lack of pace (something that made the original so absorbing) also makes the action far less exciting than it should be.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,The moose and the squirrel join a handful of friends to push buttons in the right order. [Issue#33 p.117]
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,GameStar,55,Despite all the freedom for the player Underworld Ascendant is a bug-spectacle that in spite of its great looks is more boring than thrilling.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,n-Revolution Magazine UK,50,Okay if you can get it cheap but there are far too many better party titles out there.
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,Da Gameboyz,60,With poor controls a mediocre graphics package sans the great characters and music that was bland all these make for a somewhat boring and average boxing experience.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,GameZone,69,Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing has a slew of faults that inevitably bring the title down but that’s not to say that you won’t have a good time in the ring.
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,PSX-Sense.nl,60,A fitting tribute to classic dungeon crawlers though low difficulty a lack of a level editor and a boring esthetic keep it from becoming a classic in and of itself.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,Game Over Online,56,A silly story that the developers don’t try to develop generally easy puzzles that are boring to solve a bad interface that tests your patience more than your intelligence and so-so graphics that don’t make the game fun to look at.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,52,This game has no excuse. Its very expensive for what it has to offer and if I were to polish my Flash and ActionScript knowledge I could have created it myself!
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Nintendo Gamer,48,We applaud the return to nature but outside of a few icky moments there really is nothing to recommend Necro-Nesia. Go throw a spider at someone; its a whole lot more fun. [JPN Import; Mar 2007 p.52]
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameSpot,45,Its got plenty of cute Tamagotchis but its short on depth and is seriously lacking in the fun department.
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Pocket Gamer UK,40,The release of Urban Champion as a 3D Classic makes us wonder if Nintendo has gone stark raving mad.
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,3DJuegos,45,Lucha Fury is a beat-em-up with a polished artistic direction colorful visuals and poor gameplay.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,Gaming Age,58,Consider it only if youve got a captive audience no internet connection and some time to kill with friends — and above all else dont expect too much.

Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,COGconnected,65,Though there are some definite strengths throughout Past Cure like the textural environments the melodies and the overall world duality it simply fails to really take advantage of the hype gained from its badass trailers.
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,AtomicGamer,50,Dead Space: Ignition isnt a great game or even a good one.
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,GameSpot,45,No amount of Xzibit influence or ride pimpage can save Pimp My Ride from its god-awful minigames and lousy driving mechanics.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GamesRadar+,40,There are a ton of fine shooters hitting shelves this year that are good enough to go down in history. It would be a shame to waste your money paying full price for this heap which instead takes history down with it.
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Armchair Empire,45,Sniper: Art of Victory is a budget title and as such can be excused for some superficial failings. Unfortunately some of its failings are more than superficial take much of the fun out of the game.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Next Level Gaming,50,As for Torino 2006 I would look in the bargain bin for International Winter Sports 2002 instead.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Long-dead genre strikes back with cool screenplay and compelling story.

Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,PlayStation Universe,55,Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn is a fun title for as long as it lasts and a forgettable one once it ends.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Electronic Gaming Monthly,55,It feels like youre not fully in control. [Dec 2002 p.236]
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,GameWatcher,50,Kung Fu Rider is definitely not as funny as it thinks it is and not really much fun either.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,COGconnected,50,For my interest in something to be increased it has to be entertaining. This is where NBA Live 14 ultimately falls short for me.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,GameGrin,50,There were elements that I enjoyed about Coffin Dodgers and the fast-paced action and ragdoll physics led to some crazy races and funny fails. I enjoyed the story mode especially with its amusing ending. Plus the final showdown race is brilliant. But the game lacks depth and doesn’t really have that draw that made me want to keep playing especially with the omission of online features.
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Nintendo Gamer,47,With a few more months development this might have come good. But in this state not even Professor Xavier could convince us to play it again.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,GamesRadar+,50,The game follows a simple beat em up formula that will keep you entertained for awhile but it lacks so much of the depth and creativity that we expect from the comics and movies.
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,AceGamez,50,Damnation is an unfinished game a concept with good ideas and a real sense of scale but terrible implementation in almost every way.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,VGPub,57,I really wanted to like The Shield. Unless you’re a Shield enthusiast like me you’ll be safe passing on this one.
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Impulsegamer,45,While Orion: Dino Horde has potential it will certainly fall short of even modest expectations. If it werent for there already being quite the track record of bad Jurassic games Id suggest that fighting dinosaurs has never been so dull. A shame since its evident that the developers put a lot of time into it... its just too bad they didnt focus on making it fun.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Leave your superhero cape at home; Dream Chronicles instead begs for a mouse and keyboard--but this is a 360 game and theres no such pairing in sight.

Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,GameSpot,60,A number of notable frustrations keep this moderately enjoyable flight-combat sim from soaring.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameZone,57,Add some simple moves a little combo and repeat...constantly. The special death move was also a failed attempt in my book.
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Nintendojo,47,The controls are buggy the graphics are choppy the sound is average and the voices will make you crawl up a wall in fear of your life.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,SpazioGames,45,A mere shadow of what a scrolling beatem up should be. The TMNT logo isnt enough to justify such a poor game who will particularly let down the ones who really loved the comics and the animated series dedicated to the four Ninja Turtles.
Hollow,Switch,Feb-22-2018,MMEU,Action Adventure | Survival,Nintenderos,68,A horror game with good ideas that comes up short in many aspects: while its history is addictive and progressively improves its short duration brings us back to reality and while its setting and sound put us in a tense mood with some jump scares mixed in its technical side takes us out of that mood with a significant range of defects to be cleaned up.

Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Games Master UK,55,Not quite so bad its good but not so bad its awful either. Its worth a rent but just for laughs. [Aug 2009 p.82]
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,Brash Games,50,When the various elements come together which does happen in certain sections and when fate allows the game has the potential to be a clever informative and historically accurate stealth game set among one of the most intriguing and fascinating in recent history but too often this potential is over shadowed by clunky controls questionable AI and dated graphics that make the game look like it is a port from a previous console generation.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Hot Games,60,The same mediocre game on the Cube as it was on the PS2.
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameZone,48,Really disappointing [gameplay] poor controls poorly designed missions poor execution.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Game World Navigator Magazine,51,Every level is very small and no matter where you decide to hole up it will be easy for enemies to flank you. It’s not bad by itself but such design makes cover system – which was to become one of Umbrella Corps’ trump cards – redundant. So it comes as no surprise that combat quickly devolves into chasing after one another with one-hit-kill ax in hand. Of course it’s hard to talk about tactics or teamplay in this lumberjack’s paradise. [Issue#211 p.56]
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Push Square,40,While this won’t put off those who managed to overlook the shortcomings of the previous two games those looking to sign up for the first time on this voyage may want to seriously consider if the pirate life is for them.
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,Official Xbox Magazine,65,The individual layers of variation dont run terribly deep and offline exhibitions only cast a harsh light on amateurish A.I. flaws but Double D Dodgeballs offbeat mix of arcade action and online sporting teamwork still packs enough fast-paced intensity and simple strategy to be worth inviting to recess. [Sept 2008 p.77]
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,DarkStation,50,Arc of Alchemist had potential but ultimately fails to deliver a compelling experience. If you like chibi characters lots of dialogue grinding and mindless battle systems you might enjoy Arc of Alchemist. Otherwise this is a game you can easily skip.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Yahoo!,50,The worst-case scenario is that you pick a fight with the game store clerk who let you buy this title and get your face punched in. Then youll be stuck with both a black eye and a crummy game.
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PlayStation LifeStyle,50,Eternity: The Last Unicorn is not a great game. It’s a game that takes from Norse mythology but doesn’t really go deep enough to make you feel like you’re on a viking adventure. You can’t skip the cut scenes the camera is the hardest boss in the game and it just doesn’t live up to the games it emulates. I like you Eternity I just wanted better.
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,DualShockers,45,Tokyo Tattoo Girls is an extremely niche strategy RPG that doesnt build off of what is most interesting about the games systems and instead chooses to rely on cute anime girls for appeal which might work for some.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Everyeye.it,50,All in all fun and able to show the historical characters of the brand from a different point of view ONE PIECE: Grand Cruise would have won hands down our sympathy (and sufficiency) if it had been proposed not as a game but as a VR experience maybe free or otherwise at a price consistent with the very few contents offered by the package.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,ZTGD,49,The story is original but poorly told. The action is fast-paced but frustrating. Everything seems like a winner on paper but when you finally get your hands on the controller things just fall apart.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Electric Playground,70,The gameplay of Tsunami 2265 is best-suited for younger or for casual gamers.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,Video Game Talk,50,While the game seems to be somewhat technically proficient and the single player campaign is moderately extensive the repetitive nature of the gameplay and the mind-numbing tasks tend to drag on.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Next Level Gaming,50,Theres two cops Mike and Marcus. Wheres the two player simultaneous co-op mode?
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,TeamXbox,46,Boring and sub-par gameplay combined with bland visuals and sounds creates a gaming experience that should be missed. More time was needed fine tuning things such as game mechanics visuals and audio.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Next Level Gaming,47,With all of the gameplay and control issues the game simply isn’t any fun.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,48,It would be nice to play as each character in a Gauntlet-style format but the lack of distinctive abilities for each of the four characters puts the kibosh on that dream. One could surmise that this game was doomed from the start.
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,GamesRadar+,50,Even for hardcore Dead Space fans (which we are) skipping Ignition will mean missing nothing of import to the Dead Space canon.
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,Windows Central,50,With a user interface barely optimized for controllers and a release three years after its initial alpha it feels that consoles are a mere afterthought of the original vision.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,PSX Nation,50,If players approach Supercross World as an arcade racer that plays by the indoor and outdoor rules of motocross though then it has plenty to offer...Dead-average brain-dead motocross fun at its most basic level.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Nintendo Gamer,55,Its harmless but hardly worth bothering with. [May 2008 p.74]
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,N-Europe,60,Poor graphics and simple game-play detract from what could have been a great film-game conversion.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,GameSpot,50,While the modest selection of maps are sufficiently large and multileveled the uninspired deathmatch and conquest modes offer nothing that you cant find in other shooters.
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,ZTGD,45,Its sad really if under a different developer – it could have made for a viable opponent to the big boxing titles like but instead DSI games decided to make it a cheap gimmicky imitation of that which came before.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,40,Its obvious that some care and talent went into the making of this game. Unfortunately it just didnt dribble down to the most important part - the gameplay.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Worth Playing,55,Suffers from mediocrity. It is a solid game but there is nothing outstanding about it that would draw players to it or make the title worth acquiring. The game implements the two signature characters poorly which makes for annoying gameplay and there is no multiplayer portion whatsoever.
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,Worth Playing,55,Its difficult to not view the NCIS game as a blatant cash grab. It may be available at the lower price point of $40 ($30 for PC) but the four cases only take about four hours to complete and there is zero replay value.
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,IGN,50,Imagine if you will a weapon that not only blows a guy to smithereens and covers the screen with more blood than a MASH unit but also causes him to burst into flames and even projectile vomit all over himself for several painful seconds before he blows up. And if that isnt disgusting enough for you imagine grabbing one of his severed legs and whacking another dude over the head with it until he in turn spews even more blood and vomit and flames. Ew.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GameZone,55,The History Channel implementation level setup and graphic selections are A+ choices; it’s the execution that tanks the experience.
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Hardcore Gamer,40,The only way I could possibly recommend this game to anyone is if you have a blossoming interest in both breasts and fighting games and are trapped on some sort of desert island with a PS3 that only has Girl Fight on it. Everyone else is going to want to look elsewhere.
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,Da Gameboyz,51,I went into Valhalla Knights with high hopes including the optimism for a clean and smart online co-op multiplayer with a deep and engrossing storyline. Unfortunately I found a very broken and incomplete gaming experience.
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,Ragequit.gr,45,Super Seducer can only be seen as a relic of a thankfully bygone era and may only crack a smile with its cult vibe. The whole PUA idea has already been criticized and no-one is expected to take it seriously. Other than that its a sort of visual novel with linear progression that glorifies the quantification of flirting and the conditioning of people to Pavlovian techniques.
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,GameZone,55,This game is not very realistic and tries to combine arcade elements with a solid FPS backdrop and what happens is that this game looks contrived and stilted...This is a game to avoid.
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,DarkZero,50,Theres no denying it. Star Raiders is bad. Its repetitive embarrassing rushed and tedious.
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,ZTGD,61,King of Clubs feels like yet another me too title in a sea of the same.
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Digitally Downloaded,70,But again I found the soul of Langrisser to be well and truly in the right place and while I don’t believe it is a classic game I also don’t believe for a moment that it deserves the commentary it has been getting to date.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Games Master UK,40,Frustrating and joyless. [Apr 2009 p.74]
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Theres only one number that reflects this perfectly average experience.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,Edge Magazine,50,It’s a B-movie game in every sense but approach it with sufficiently lowered expectations and you may just be pleasantly surprised.
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,GameZone,65,This game is fun until you try to move. Rent the movie folks. It’s scarier and shorter.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,IGN,55,Its never anything special. Theres lots of action but its not exciting. Theres an upgrade system but its uninteresting. Theres a lot of content but its just the same stuff again and again.
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GameZone,40,This is by far one of the most disappointing and seemingly unfinished games that I have ever played in my entire life.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameWatcher,50,Its not a terrible game but it is a deeply average one.
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,PC Gamer UK,49,Rarely exciting mostly disappointing. An unfinished tactical shooter let down by technical issues and terrible AI.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Game Chronicles,50,While the game packs some potential the constant barrage of technical glitches renders it all but unplayable and leave it feeling like an unfinished work that was rushed to the shelves a month or two too soon.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,45,It’s boilerplate first-person shooter mechanics paired with dated visuals and cool ideas that never develop into cool experiences.
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Vandal,50,Quotation forthcoming.
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,IGN,40,This game is not fun. The game is too hard to be a childrens game and too boring to be a game to recommend to anyone; and thats when its working and not screwing the player over with bad controls.
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Vandal,45,Agony has good ideas but the developers have underrated the complexity of the survival horror genre and delivered a frustrating experience. Add its poor performance and bugs and you get a forgettable game.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Game Chronicles,58,I am a diehard Transformers fan ever since the original G1 series and I cant believe such a staple of the series is missing. With the lack of features average graphics acceptable sound and a completion time of less than 7 hours Id say Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition is a budget title at best but nothing an avid gamer or hardcore fan would take seriously especially with the 50$ price tag.
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,GameZone,50,Any fan of the genre has already been here and done this before — probably 2-3 years ago. While the visual and aural facets of YAE are generally solid its gameplay is not all that entertaining and there are plenty of other titles in the genre that can offer a more entertaining and diversified gaming experience.
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Worth Playing,50,A bad camera and bad controls however quickly shoot down this game with little to no hope of it getting better as you progress. For fans of the movie and the character it would be best to hunt down the GBA game to get their fix. If you dont have a system that can play that however your best bet would be to hold off on this and hope that someone will come along and do justice to this revered character.
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,TeamXbox,44,Had it been released as a slimmed-down Xbox Live Arcade title Bomberman Act: Zero would be a surefire hit right up there with Zuma in terms of addictive stage-based gameplay. But instead Bomberman Act: Zero is a $49.99 standalone title that you simply shouldn’t buy.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,NintendoWorldReport,40,As with most JPRGs a lot of progression options are present related to special powers and weapon upgrades. Since they don’t make the combat any easier to digest it doesn’t feel relevant to get too detailed about them. Not mentioning that you manually have to click through endless English dialogue while listening to Japanese voice acting doesn’t really change the fact that Fantasy Hero ~Unsigned Legacy~ is a title that can and should be ignored.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,G4 TV,40,If anything The Shield: The Game is true to the spirit of its source material. Much of the game may be poorly designed cruelly difficult and obnoxiously unfair but none of these flaws are necessarily show-stopping.
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,ZTGD,40,Girl Fight is a game that lives up to its name both in relevancy and simply being generic. Anyone thinking of jumping in knows what to expect but if you want scantily clad fighters there are much better options.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,Yahoo!,60,Dull depressing and monotonous. Although the combat system is reasonably interesting the game doesnt come close to making the most of it.
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,TeamXbox,51,The game is fun to play for a bit but the flaws of the gameplay and the repetition creep up faster than Capones top enforcer in a dark alley delivering the most lethal blow to the games bottom line.
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,Cheat Code Central,40,Are we going to be forever destined to inferior products based on popular characters wading through a series of hackneyed mini games?
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Meristation,50,After a complicated first launch Amy is reborn again to give some scares to this needed generation. Its a shame that all the good ideas the game has in its basics are not applied to the final version plagued with multiple bugs of AI control and visuals.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameSpot,40,Shallow and repetitive gameplay dull visuals and overused poor-quality film assets put this game in the failed-superhero category.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,GameZone,43,While it’s not the worst Superman game ever made it’s still not anything any sane person would want to play. If you need a Superman fix go rent the DVD instead.
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,Cynamite,60,Hulk’s orgy of destruction is entertaining at the beginning but unfortunately it’s the only motivating thing in the game. Both the missions and the story are weak.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Games Radar,61,With precious little true depth and a distinct lack of quality boxers to topple Tyson from his in-game mantle youll just not want to put in the hours at the gym. [PSM2]
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Only hipsters and farming fetishists need apply. [Nov 2013 p.91]
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,IGN,43,No matter what happens with stability and bug-fixing patches its poor controls awful interface and dull pacing ensure that X Rebirth will remain unpleasant for all but the most forgiving die-hard space jockeys.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,Push Square,50,Dawn of Fear is not what you would typically consider a good video game and it most definitely does not perform like one. However when it works there hasn’t been anything else quite like it for the best part of two decades. Dawn of Fear is the best and worst tribute to Resident Evil at the same time and we cant think anything more intriguing than that.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,Nintendo Power,48,Responsive play control and detailed graphics will make you want to venture deep into the story but difficult battles against incidental enemies may keep you from your goal. [Aug 2004 p.123]
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Nintendo Power,46,A compass points to your current objective but its still easy to get lost in the games complex levels. [Mar 2004 p.121]
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Computer Gaming World,50,Underneath its underwhelming exterior lurks an enjoyable well-balanced game that grows on you if you can just stomach the painful delivery. [May 2002 p.74]
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,Console Gameworld,45,Despite a cool concept the unusable controls and other flaws prevent Dragon Booster from making the cut.
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Vandal,49,It feels unfinished and rushed through development. We really think it couldve been polished to make it a better game but unless an important patch comes out its really hard to recommend taking into account all the constant crashes when playing online and the extremely short single player modes.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,PC Gamer,65,Mistmare has some truly wondrous landscapes and jaw-dropping monsters and such thanks in no small part to the LithTech engine but it just came out of the oven too early. [Nov 2003 p.118]
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,Pocket Games,45,Has the feel of a hasty port which is par for the course with Mortal Kombat games these days. But fun for a short while. [Summer 2003 p.30]
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,PSM Magazine,50,Sure its oddly satisfying to lumber around trading shots and crossing plasma swords with other stylized death machines but the slow stiff gameplay overshadows the cool stuff. [Jan. 2007 p.84]
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,MEGamers,57,Buy this game only if youre under 12 and a fan of the movie.
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,Cheat Code Central,48,With only ten levels and no multiple pathways the game is fairly short on content. You will most likely only play this game for three to five hours making the forty-dollar price tag seem way too steep to consider it for a purchase. Still the game can be a lot of fun.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Cynamite,40,Even fans of the comic won’t have fun with this piece. At the beginning the permanent explosions are quite entertaining but soon they get as boring as the monotony of a firing machine gun. No thanks!
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,48,The controls are so weak that I am having a tough time deciding which is more aggravating: controlling Bruce Lee or non-stop clipping. Either way youll be disgruntled by this games lack of an intuitive control system.
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,SpazioGames,45,The problems of Rekoil are many starting with the unbalanced weapon system to the extremely annoying and frequent visual bugs. The respawn system has been miscalculated. Bad sound animations and poor 3D models come together to provide a badly balanced game.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,DarkStation,50,As it is Zombeer stands as a decent zombie based FPS with a dash of hit or miss humor.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,Worth Playing,45,If you really want to play a volleyball video game stick with the older titles that focus on beach volleyball or pray that someone can come up with a better take on the indoor version of the sport.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,Siliconera,41,Since the game does provide some laughs and is fun when a friend is over $20 isnt too bad for the game.
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,GameCritics,40,Weeping Doll isn’t much of a game and at just an hour long with no hidden depth to necessitate a second playthrough it’s overpriced at ten dollars. That said as a first-generation console VR proof-of-concept it succeeds more than it fails.
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Gamer's Hell,52,The multiplayer can be fun but only because it means you wont have to endure the game alone.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,GameCritics,65,Apart from that absolutely baffling meat grinder at the end Id still recommend Escape to fans of the mid-list. 98% of it was an enjoyable spiral into insanity and the project could certainly stand on its own even without being attached to the Dead Island franchise -- just be ready to slog through that final bit to see how it all wraps up.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,Hardcore Gamer,50,It’s admirable that Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric tries so many new things but every path it follows is a dead end.
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,TheXboxHub,40,Gene Rain is a disappointment. It is ultimately good looking enough but shallow with poor gameplay and frankly laughable dialogue. The acting is poor the guns lack heft and the cover mechanic is broken so much that you really don’t want to get me started.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,COGconnected,37,The clunky controls combined with a ghost town of players to actually play this game online with really works against this title.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Cheat Code Central,44,A game that you should certainly pass by. It has few if any redeeming qualities and Im hard-pressed to imagine the sort of person who could actually have fun with this title.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,45,It’s a half-baked attempt at a game that can be fun in the occasional spooky part but ends up under-delivering in every way.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,55,If only the developers had spent more time polishing the single player mode to have a real story with in-game cutscenes and such. If only the single player had a mid-mission save system or at the very least if it didnt take so long to reload the level every time you died.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Gameblog.fr,40,Like the movie The Expendables 2 video game is shallow and focused on but one thing : brutal combats with millions of bullets flying. The only problem is that as it may be fun to watch in a 1 hour and a half movie its far from being fun to play for 3 and half hours even cooperatively especially with such low production values.
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,IGN,40,Why strain your eyes on a smaller version of the stack when you can just clear some space off the kitchen table and play the real thing?
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,XGN,50,This unique fighting game feels rushed in every single way. Fighters Uncaged responds very badly to your moves and thats simply something you cant afford when your life is at stake.
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,AceGamez,50,Mr Mirra may have been around for a long time but it seems that it is possible for an old rider to need to learn some new tricks because a lack of originality and options as well as some below par design overshadow the better qualities of Dave Mirra BMX Challenge.
Coliseum,PC,Jan-6-2004,Stormcloud Creations,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing,Frictionless Insight,50,Doesn’t feel interactive enough to be deeply involving. Much faster higher level seasons or far more options are needed to make the Coliseum exciting.
Kabuki Warriors,Xbox,Nov-19-2001,Light Weight,Action | Fighting | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine,59,A strangely bland fighting game. [Jan 2002]
Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,3DJuegos,52,Poor presentation poor playability AI-fueled opponent… If you are fan of pool games there are simply better options available.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,40,Give me a quality plot or an interesting setting or something to impress me enough to work through its weaker elements. Magus doesnt offer any stand out feature which makes it difficult to get too excited over.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Game Rant,50,Ghostbusters offers a top-down co-op shooter with light RPG elements that fails to capitalize on the magic and humor of the supernatural franchise.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GameZone,75,A must-have for any fan of the show. It is amusing and entertaining.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,CGMagazine,45,Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5 fails to recapture the magic of the first four games.
Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Console Gameworld,50,While every series needs its foundation Toy Shop feels like the blueprint of something better.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,Impulsegamer,55,Maybe if this budget title were offered for 5 dollars more gamers might be interested in putting on their asskicking shoes. For now though I cant offer much of a recommendation.
