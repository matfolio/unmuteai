Theres a ton of content to go over and while the story can be nonsensical at times it remains entertaining for those who arent averse to anime or a visual novel style of game.

If you had a similar feeling to what I did don’t let that previous experience prevent you from trying out this new offering. Whether Nintendo learned some lessons during the first run or if the extra time in development allowed them to release a more polished experience I’m not sure. But what I do know is that the Labo Vehicle Kit is miles ahead of its predecessors and has made me excited again about the future of this franchise.

Magicka: Wizard Wars,PC,May-27-2014,Paradox North,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General,Hooked Gamers,80,Magicka: Wizard Wars definitely struggles a bit with its steep learning curve and some serious bugs that need to be addressed but the quick energetic games are largely worth the struggles.

The Bunker,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Splendy Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,GameCritics,80,Although I hate to be so vague about The Bunker giving away too much would be doing a great disservice to anyone reading this review. Instead I’ll simply say that it’s one of the most enjoyable FMV games I’ve ever played and that I’d recommend prospective players block out two hours and go through it all in a single sitting.

Monsters vs. Aliens,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Beenox,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PGNx Media,83,Overall Monsters vs. Aliens is a solid videogame adaptation from the movie. The combination of standard action-platforming more traditional puzzle-based platforming and on-rails races that you’ll experience with the different characters provides just enough variety and challenge for the game’s target market. If your child is a fan of the movie you’ll want to pick up the game.

The Mage's Tale,PlayStation 4,Feb-5-2019,InXile Entertainment,Adventure | General,Digital Chumps,82,Few VR games integrate story boss battles combat puzzles and motion control into one competent brew–usually more than one of those things is absent from the end result. But as I lifted my controller to my mouth to drink a potion or something in the options menu or looked behind me to toss a spell enhancement into a frog’s mouth I didn’t feel like I was doing anything except having a great time with a good game which also happened to be one of the best VR experiences around.

Alone in the Dark: Inferno,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2008,Eden Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameCritics,95,Its impossible to know for sure but I can only imagine that if the initial version had been as finely-honed as Inferno it would have received a much warmer welcome.

Pathologic 2,PC,May-28-2019,Ice-Pick Lodge | tinyBuild,Action Adventure | Survival,GameCritics,95,Pathologic 2 is a harsh unwelcoming experience that took a lot out of me but everything in it no matter how odd or seemingly inconsequential is setup for an eventual payoff. Players capable of embracing its dour atmosphere will be rewarded with one of gaming’s greatest narrative accomplishments — it’s an epic-length refutation of the idea that gratification can only come through success that stories need to be about heroes that fun is the only metric by which a game’s quality can be measured. Pathologic 2 is a masterpiece not in spite of its shortcomings but because of them. There is truly nothing else like it.
Sonic and the Secret Rings,Wii,Feb-20-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Worth Playing,86,It has points where you must grind for levels much like an RPG.

Still none of these points makes this entry any less valid.

Golf: Tee It Up!,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2008,Housemarque,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,GamePro,90,Golf: Tee It Up! loses points for its minimalist approach (only 2 courses and limited character customization doesnt help) but because it still has a full-game-for-the-price-of-an-arcade-game feel attractive visuals and holds the promise of more downloadable content in the future its a great value.
Lost Sphear,PC,Jan-23-2018,Tokyo RPG Factory,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,PLAY! Zine,80,Compiling nostalgia into a lovely chaos Lost Sphear fires its mediocre edges into beautiful fireworks.

That thorough exploration of death ties into every aspect of the game from its hack and slash gameplay to the ending choice that will leave players reflecting upon the journey they just went on. It isn’t often that a game truly succeeds as art but every part of Oninaki goes back into its core motif and that’s why it is an essential action RPG.

Okhlos,PC,Aug-18-2016,Coffee Powered Machine,Action Adventure | General,We Got This Covered,90,Okhlos is organised chaos at its best. The challenge level may provide moments of frustration leading to multiple viewings of initial areas but it’s easy to lose hours of time from the determination to send every God back to Olympus where they belong.
Lume,PC,May-9-2011,State of Play Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,GameShark,83,Its unclear whether there will be more to Lume later (as the closing credits hint at a continuation of the story and a possible part two) but Ill be first in line if there is. This is a very light charming little game that deserves an hour or two of your time. Just be sure to have a walkthrough ready for when you get to the crazy combination lock puzzle.
Rust,PC,Feb-8-2018,Facepunch Studios,Historic | Action Adventure | Survival,Meristation,85,Rust goes where no other survival game has and provides an incredibly threatening experience that like a car accident is equal parts horrifying and mystifying.
The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier Episode 3: Above the Law,PlayStation 4,Mar-28-2017,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,PSX-Sense.nl,85,Dont let the slow start of the episode fool you; this is quite a ride ending on a spectacular cliffhanger that will leave any fan desperate for more.
SWAT: Global Strike Team,PlayStation 2,Oct-29-2003,Argonaut Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Next Level Gaming,89,I must say that I was actually very impressed with the sounds in SWAT: Global Strike Team.
Freaky Flyers,GameCube,Aug-8-2003,Midway,Driving | Racing | Kart,Game Chronicles,86,Giving the characters stories within the game not only lends them more life than most racing game characters it gives players a good reason to keep going until youve seen them all.
Hulk,Xbox,May-27-2003,Radical Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Playboy,100,Best of all the games environments are destructible so if it exists Hulk can smash it. [July 2003 p.34]

Strider 2,PlayStation,Jul-29-2000,Capcom,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Fan,89,All the bosses in Strider 2 look awesome and hopefully will inspire younger players to realize what a real side-scrolling action game should be like.
Silhouette Mirage,PlayStation,Dec-31-1999,Treasure,Action | General,IGN,89,A brilliant 2D-action game that deserves a lot of praise. This game genre has been around since 80s so its awe-inspiring that a company would be able to bring such new and innovative ideas to something thats been done for so long.
Psikyo Shooting Stars Alpha,Switch,Jan-21-2020,Psikyo,Miscellaneous | Compilation,TheSixthAxis,80,Barring Sol Divide this is a great collection of shooters from one of the best in the business. If you’re a fan of the shmup that hasn’t made the leap into these titles on Switch now’s the perfect time to do so even if it does only just manage to justify its price versus picking up the games separately.
Irony Curtain: From Matryoshka with Love,Switch,Jun-27-2019,Artifex Mundi,Adventure | General,Switch Player,80,Irony Curtain: From Matryoshka with Love is a beautifully executed point-and-click experience that combines a gripping narrative humourous characters and rich scenes to create an unforgettable espionage adventure. Fans of the point-and-click classics won’t want to miss this one out.
Aftercharge,Xbox One,Jan-10-2019,Chainsawesome Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,CGMagazine,85,Aftercharge truly has the potential to be the next big thing with all fundamentals of what makes a shooter great but in its early days its clear there is still polish that could done to the overall experience.
Disco Dodgeball Remix,Switch,May-22-2018,Zen Studios,Sports | Team | Futuristic,GamingTrend,90,Overall I loved Disco Dodgeball Remix. This wacky FPS dodge ball game keeps the fun coming with various game modes high intensity music and extremely entertaining gameplay. Although the art style looks a bit childish it works for this game.
Tumble VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Supermassive Games,Puzzle | Stacking,Playstation Official Magazine UK,80,A must-own puzzler. [Dec 2016 p.89]
Buzz! Junior: Dino Den,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2008,SCEE,Miscellaneous | Trivia / Game Show,VideoGamer,80,You are getting more of the same but the new mini-games are different enough to warrant a purchase even if players have put plenty of time into Jungle Party Monster Rumble and Robo Jam.
FreeStyle Street Basketball,PC,May-15-2007,JC Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade | Arcade,AtomicGamer,78,Overall Freestyle Street Basketball has the potential to be a neat game. The idea is solid the graphics and overall style are neat and the gameplay is pretty fun. However the horrible players you have to get through to eventually play with the decent ones will turn people away and the lag will push even more away.
The Simpsons Game,DS,Oct-30-2007,Griptonite Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Thunderbolt,80,The Simpsons Game for the DS may not be innovative nor appealing to worldwide mainstream audiences - you really do need to be a fan of the show to appreciate what’s been done here – but it’s a highly creative production nonetheless.
The Occupation,Xbox One,Mar-5-2019,White Paper Games,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Xbox Tavern,84,The Occupation’s compelling story sits rather well with its intelligent framework. This is for the most part an intriguing real-time detective game that sports some solid features and robust mechanics collectively putting forward a tense and constantly exciting affair. Indeed there’s a few persistent technical flaws present that tend to interfere with the game’s flow but in the face of everything that The Occupation gets right they’re easy to overlook.
Tannenberg,PC,Feb-13-2019,Blackmill Games,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Shooter | First-Person | General | Tactical,Hooked Gamers,85,Tannenberg takes what made Verdun fun and improves upon what made it awesome. The new environments in particular really make the potential of a WWI FPS/Simulator really stand out and stick with memorable moments that last long after a match is over. The developers proved themselves with their support of Verdun over time which gives me reason to believe that Tannenberg is only going to get better from here.
Earth Defense Force 2025,PlayStation 3,Feb-18-2014,Sandlot,Shooter | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Age,91,Its a game thats never about anything more than having a blast (and of course blowing up bugs space robots and buildings) — what more could anyone want?
AO Tennis 2,PlayStation 4,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,Player 2,75,AO Tennis 2 is a deep and rewarding simulation that offers much for the hardcore tennis fan. An initial difficulty wall will likely put a few players off but for those that persist there is a rewarding and deep game of tennis to be found.
SIMULACRA 2,PC,Jan-30-2020,Kaigan Games OU | Kaigan Games,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,TheGamer,80,Simulacra 2 is at its best when it is rewarding strong attention to detail and at its worst when its punishing you for guessing incorrectly in dialogue sequences. The acting is strong by FMV standards too. I like this series and I appreciate how much it grew between the two games. Im excited to see where they go next with it.
Blacksad: Under the Skin,Xbox One,Nov-5-2019,Pendulo Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Xbox Tavern,81,Blacksad: Under The Skin is an enjoyable detective game and the gritty noir story is very gripping. You care what happens to your cat-man detective and you’ll want to get to the bottom of the crime. All the other characters in the game are interesting and varied and the fact they are animals makes things a bit more entertaining. But the controls when moving Blacksad are so slow and clunky that they let the game down a tad ruining the will to explore the world fully.
Q.U.B.E. 2,Switch,Feb-21-2019,Toxic Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,The Indie Game Website,80,The story is of an archaeologist stranding on an alien planet who must… solve puzzles to escape? Plot and writing are not Q.U.B.E. 2’s strong points lying deep in Portal’s shadow but on gameplay terms this stands alone as a very gratifying experience that comes recommended.
Football Manager Handheld 2010,PSP,Dec-22-2009,Sports Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Management | Management,Vandal,85,The series keeps its excellent level and allows the most complete and realistic experience to date.
Chaos League: Sudden Death,PC,Dec-8-2005,Cyanide,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General,IncGamers,75,If there’s a redeeming factor to the game it’s that it’s a bargain at £19.99 considering you get the original Chaos League too. If you like your sports games with a touch of evil and a pinch of sadism then you’ll definitely want to check it out.
Madagascar,PlayStation 2,May-23-2005,Toys for Bob,Action | Platformer | 3D,PGNx Media,85,Undoubtedly a fun little platformer. The game boasts respectable gameplay and an impressive audio-visual combination as well as a comical plot from the folks at Dreamworks. There’s plenty to do in the levels and plenty to unlock for a second play through.
Swarm,Xbox 360,Mar-23-2011,Hothead Games,Miscellaneous | General | General,IGN,85,When you combine engaging and unique gameplay with Swarms pleasant (but dark) aesthetics and whimsical nature what you have is a great downloadable game.
Resident Evil 6,PC,Mar-22-2013,Capcom | QLOC,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,ZTGD,85,Fans looking to scratch the survival horror itch will likely still not come away impressed by the direction the series has taken. Resident Evil has become more of an action-horror game; a change I have welcomed with open arms.
Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers,PC,Jun-15-2010,Stainless Games,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,PC Format,81,A decent game. [Sept 2010 p.105]
Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter,Xbox 360,Jan-13-2010,Croteam,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,MS Xbox World,85,Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter for the Xbox 360 is a return of a classic. It may seem a little dated by some but I personally believe that for both newcomers and nostalgic gamers like myself the HD remake that is now available still provides a wonderful experience in terms of both speed and adrenaline pumping action.
Kirby's Blowout Blast,3DS,Jul-6-2017,Nintendo | HAL Labs,Action | General,Vooks,100,Kirby’s Blowout Blast is easily my favourite of the mini games released on the 3DS due to how much more depth is has compared to the others. You’re getting around 5-6 hours of play from your $10 purchase making it a good way to tide you over until Kirby returns later this year on the 3DS and Switch in 2018.
NHL 2K10,Xbox 360,Sep-15-2009,Take-Two Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,WonderwallWeb,90,If you love hockey you will love this its one of the best around.
Order of War,PC,Sep-22-2009,Wargaming.net,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic | Tactics,1UP,83,While it does have a few shortcomings (mostly in the pacing) Wargaming.net really has a lot to build on with Order of War and I would be thrilled to see a follow up -- perhaps even one taking place in the Pacific Theatre.
NASCAR Heat 5,Xbox One,Jul-7-2020,704Games,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,MondoXbox,80,NASCAR Heat 5 improves on the previous and successful episode adding new features and modes coupled with very well balanced difficulty modes. Its still got lot to improve in the presentation area and in the multiplayer modes too similar to the ones in previous game but while waiting for the next-gen jump this remains a very good NASCAR experience.
Dead or Alive 5 Last Round,Xbox One,Feb-17-2015,Team Ninja,Action | Fighting | 3D,IGN Spain,84,Once again almost the same game that we saw a couple of years ago but its still a worthy game for the new gen consoles that doesnt have a lot of quality fighting games available. Beautiful and smooth but a little bit aged.
Foul Play,Xbox 360,Sep-18-2013,Mediatonic,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,LevelUp,85,Foul Play runs under the premise of being an action filled theater play so youll have to keep your audience entertained at all times. The level and character design helps maintain this illusion and even though youll see the actors faces beneath the monsters costumes the cheering of the crowd will be enough motivation to don your monocle and kick some demonic butt.
Bejeweled 2 Deluxe,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,PopCap,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Matching,WHAM! Gaming,78,There are several game modes all of which are quite fun and challenging – as long as you can stop yourself from using unlimited hints in the Puzzle Mode.
The Crew 2,Xbox One,Jun-26-2018,Ubisoft Ivory Tower,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,TheXboxHub,90,In all The Crew 2 is a big step forward for the series and does its best to right the wrongs of the original. Take the time to learn the ins and outs here and you will have a game that gives you hours and hours of enjoyment.
Akimi Village,PlayStation 3,Jun-15-2011,NinjaBee,Miscellaneous | General | General,Worth Playing,85,While Xbox 360 veterans may find this to be a very similar experience in a different skin PS3 owners will be very receptive to this game especially since theyve already been the recipients of some experimental titles. Its an experience worth playing but we hope that the next iteration will include some form of multiplayer.
Ancients of Ooga,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2010,NinjaBee | Bacon Wrapped Games,Action | General | General,Eurogamer,80,With its twisted humour and mutated style lending a pleasantly Oddworld vibe to proceedings this is a crafted effort for those of us with a tendency to mutter that they dont make em like they used to. Apparently they do.
Need for Speed: Nitro,Wii,Nov-2-2009,EA Montreal,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GamePro,80,Something else that blindsided me was the killer sense of speed. Dropping behind the wheel of a Charger or Cobra for a quick race was immediately satisfying and while NITRO definitely suffers from low-res car models and building textures that doesnt stop the game from feeling frighteningly fast.
Fire Emblem Warriors,3DS,Oct-20-2017,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Areajugones,80,Fire Emblem Warriors is one of the best designed musou games of the recent years thanks to its strategy touch which is great for this genre. If you are thinking about buying this version of the game go ahead if you don’t own a Nintendo Switch because you will not be disappointed.
Def Jam: Icon,Xbox 360,Mar-6-2007,EA Chicago,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,XboxAddict,94,The game’s music system puts game audio in a brand new light making it an integral part of the action. The whole game seems to course in line with the music in a synergy that hasn’t been done but definitely should be replicated.
Pariah,PC,May-3-2005,Digital Extremes,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Total Video Games,90,In introducing weapon modification and more importantly Adrenaline/Healing Tool Pariah ends up feeling significantly different to the vast majority of shooters on the market there’s a definite sense of survival to the whole experience.
Mad Max,PlayStation 4,Sep-1-2015,Avalanche Studios,General | Action | Action Adventure | General | Open-World,ZTGD,90,Mad Max the game isn’t only a fantastic time it’s a great addition to the franchise and one of the few games that completely destroys the expectations that a movie based game has to be bad.
Shenmue III,PC,Nov-19-2019,Ys Net,Action Adventure | Open-World,Riot Pixels,84,If the original dilogy is Iliad Shenmue 3 is Odyssey a sequel that even exceeds expectations in some regards.
Valhalla Hills,PC,Dec-2-2015,Daedalic Entertainment,Strategy | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),80,A must-have for building-strategy fans offers - despite of seeming lack of content - dozens of hours of entertainment. And there are Vikings! [Issue #259]
Scaler,Xbox,Oct-20-2004,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamezilla!,91,The surprising thing about Scaler is the game is just plain fun to play. The gameplay is robust with reasonably challenging puzzles to solve the control system is enjoyable as Scaler is easy to move and smooth and the story is humorous with a solid plot.
Capcom Arcade Cabinet,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2013,M2,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Gaming Age,83,Capcom Arcade Cabinet is a fine example of a true classic collection. The DLC packs and a few strange games may scare some away from getting this one.
The Eye of Judgment: Legends,PSP,Mar-10-2010,SCEI,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,PSFocus,81,The first The Eye of Judgment was a unique game. The PlayStation Portable version is the one without a camera but with the same elements. The unique aspect is lost but the strategy gameplay is still very good. Only the story in this game is a bit boring and the gameplay isn’t for anyone.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,GameCube,Nov-8-2005,Electronic Arts,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Nintendo Power,85,A great leap forward for the Potter franchise and a fun and inclusive gaming experience. [Jan 2006 p.107]
Hey! Pikmin,3DS,Jul-28-2017,Nintendo | Arzest,Action | Platformer | 2D,Digital Chumps,90,As my first Pikmin experience I really enjoyed Hey! Pikmin for a variety of reasons and found little wrong with it. Whether you have played a Pikmin game before or not or are just looking for a fun game that’s not too easy and certainly not too hard give this one a go. I believe a demo is still available from the eShop at the time of this writing as well.
Rayman 3 HD,Xbox 360,Mar-21-2012,Ubisoft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Game Chronicles,82,Rayman 3 HD is a great remake of an amazing classic but it would have been nice if they could have updated the controls and camera to be just as good as the new graphics.
ChromaGun,Switch,Jan-22-2018,Pixel Maniacs,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Switch Player,80,ChromaGun successfully utilises colour in unique and creative ways to provide an engaging experience that puzzle aficionados will relish. It could be a bit longer but as it is its a very strong puzzle shooter.
Oblitus,PC,Feb-27-2015,Connor Ullmann,Action | Platformer | 2D,Twinfinite,100,Oblitus puts a whole lot of content into a small tightly-made package. The overall aesthetic and backing music are great and the constant threat of death taking all of your accomplishments away drives play very well.
Poker Night 2,Xbox 360,Apr-24-2013,Telltale Games,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Cheat Code Central,84,Very few games are stuffed with this much personality. If you like humorous video games at all (and especially if you like Borderlands and Portal) you really need to play this. It actually makes you feel like you’re sitting in a room and hanging out with some of gaming’s favorite stars and that’s an opportunity you shouldn’t pass up unless you simply hate video games.
Ghosthunter,PlayStation 2,Aug-17-2004,SCE Studio Cambridge,Action Adventure | Horror,Cheat Code Central,90,The gameplay can become a bit a redundant and you wont find much for replay value but Ghosthunter is certainly one of the best rental choices of the year.
Foul Play,PC,Sep-18-2013,Mediatonic,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Nexus,90,With its great sense of humor exciting narrative cool art style and fun stage play antics you would think that Foul Play would be at the top of everybodys must-buy list.
Real Boxing,PlayStation Vita,Sep-17-2013,Vivid Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,TheSixthAxis,80,It may not be anything ground-breaking but I feel the title should be regarded as one of the Vita’s best games yet. With vastly improved visuals animations and control schemes over the mobile version Real Boxing on the Vita is surely the best version of the game to get.
Final Fantasy IV: The After Years,Wii,Jun-1-2009,Matrix Software,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,RPG Fan,90,Final Fantasy IV: The After Years is not only a very respectful treatment of the original it also makes me want to dust off my SNES and relive my innocent childhood love of games.
Gallop Racer 2006,PlayStation 2,May-2-2006,Tecmo,Sports | Alternative | Horse Racing,GamingTrend,88,This is not a title to sit down and play five minutes worth before you run out for errands. But if you devote some time to learning about horses and the racing itself Gallop Racer 2006 is surprisingly rewarding.
Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII,Xbox 360,Feb-11-2014,Square Enix,General | Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,MondoXbox,85,Never boring and full of brilliant open environments Lightning Returns tells a great story coupled with a new and very effective combat system. Square Enix could have done something more on the technical side but the great artistic design manages to make us turn a blind eye on some of the problems.
Need for Speed: Shift,PSP,Sep-15-2009,EA Bright Light,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,90,If its fast-paced racing you crave and you dont care about adjusting every nut and bolt on your car then Shift is an excellent game that exceeds expectations in all areas.
Tron 2.0: Killer App,Xbox,Nov-4-2004,Climax Group,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,XboxAddict,96,A shooter which genuinely does stand out from the crowd with distinction  not an easy accomplishment for a genre which is flooded with clones and has-beens.
Forsaken World,PC,Mar-22-2011,Perfect World Entertainment,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,GamingXP,86,The vibrant community is what makes the difference Forsaken World is simply not forsaken. The key points for a MMO are available right away: Cool graphics lots of players and even more details.
Lips: Party Classics,Xbox 360,Mar-2-2010,iNiS,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,RealGamer,80,Lips: Party Classics doesn’t really do anything to expand the series in any way but unlike most music games features a track list which is probably one of the best to grace such a game of course it’s all down to taste but with something on offer to cover most players music choice the game should prove to be a hit at any party.
Disney's Chicken Little: Ace in Action,PlayStation 2,Nov-9-2006,Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,75,Theyre all solid and theyre all fun with just the perfect difficulty curve for the younger set while featuring enough challenge and mass destruction to keep parents interests. [Jan. 2007 p.89]
Mario Party 5,GameCube,Nov-10-2003,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Party,Nintendophiles,95,Adds a few nice modes to the Mario Party series but if you already own Mario Party 4 there is absolutely no reason to upgrade.
SWAT: Global Strike Team,Xbox,Oct-29-2003,Argonaut Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Next Level Gaming,89,The most important thing is that SWAT: Global Strike Team is just a damn fun game to play. I must say that I am a little disappointed about not being able to play online but the extra downloadable content through Xbox Live does help ease the pain.
Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup,Xbox,Oct-28-2003,Electronic Arts,Sports | Alternative | Other,GameBiz,82,Unfortunately it can grow a little bit repetitive and is a bit too easy.
Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights,PlayStation 2,May-20-2002,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Electric Playground,90,I think I keep saying this but Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights is fun. And thats about what all these words youve just read amount to.
1nsane,PC,Feb-5-2001,Invictus,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Games Radar,100,Listen: Insane works. It works because its multiplayer it works because its simple and it works because its fun. Youd do well to remember that but you wont because youre so desperate to replay the cliched gaming youve already experienced on your thousand-pound calculator. Stupid. All the best...
Oni,PlayStation 2,Jan-29-2001,Rockstar Toronto,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Daily Radar,88,Theres refreshingly little emphasis on lever pulling or jumping puzzles -- someone out there is listening.
Quake III: Team Arena,PC,Dec-18-2000,id Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Armchair Empire,92,A great add-on for fans of the Quake series and multiplayer mayhem. This is a must have for the frag fanatic.
Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror,PC,Oct-31-1997,Revolution Software,Adventure | Third-Person | Point-and-Click | Modern | Modern,Gaming Age,83,The sound is another area in which The Smoking Mirror excels. Although there isnt a constant soundtrack playing haunting music often accompanies certain actions much like the original Tomb Raider.
Runespell: Overture,PC,Jul-20-2011,Mystic Box,Role-Playing | General | General,Cheat Code Central,82,The only real complaint I have-besides the non-scrolling map mentioned earlier-is that the game has no multiplayer mode.
Ivy the Kiwi?,DS,Aug-24-2010,Prope,Action | General | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Nintendo Life,90,Ivy the Kiwi is the perfect example of the type of enjoyable and refreshing gaming experience that can be created when a developer isnt afraid to try something a little different.
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,Xbox,Mar-23-2006,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII,TeamXbox,83,The Follow Camera turns a decent game into a great game. Deeper multiplayer support would have been nice to drive home the next-gen quotient.
Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games: Tokyo 2020,Switch,Nov-5-2019,Sega,Sports | Individual | Athletics,GameSpace,90,The amount of events is just right to get the most fun for your money.
Thrillville,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Frontier Developments,Strategy | General,GamingTrend,87,If youre looking for a fun game that you can play with the kids or as a group this is a solid purchase and does its job quite well.
Turok,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2008,Propaganda Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Play Magazine,90,Even with a weak script Turoks flexible play mechanics strong level designs and high production values make the story mode alone worth the price of admission. [Jan 2008 p.49]
Resident Evil 0: HD Remaster,Xbox One,Jan-19-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,Gamers' Temple,85,Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster is easily the most unique of the old-school RE games and one that should be experienced if youre a fan of the series.
My Memory of Us,Xbox One,Oct-10-2018,Juggler Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,XBLA Fans,100,The game’s presentation is like a kid’s book that came to life and you get to control the heroes which is a stark contract in some ways to the deep nature of the plot. The story is based as a loose allegory for World War II. They obviously made a lot of changes such as the robotic enemies; however they handled an incredibly complex and dark theme well. I am very glad I got the opportunity to experience it. I had no clue what the game was when I fired it up on my Xbox. It was a pleasant surprise and I hope more people get the chance to play and appreciate this work of art.
Farming Simulator 17,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2016,Maximum Games,Simulation | Virtual | Career,Multiplayer.it,83,This is simply the best chapter of the series.
I Am Alive,Xbox 360,Mar-7-2012,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Guardian,100,I Am Alive uses its post-apocalyptic environment far more effectively than many other games that share its nightmare vision of the future. I Am Alive joins games such as Fallout RAGE and Left 4 Dead in its setting where a some horrendous event put paid to civilisation as we know it but in truth its far closer in its atmosphere and aesthetic values to Cormac MacCarthys grim post-apocalyptic novel The Road.
Conan,Xbox 360,Oct-23-2007,Nihilistic,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Play.tm,85,An absolutely storming adventure and I will definitely recommend it to any fans of the genre; it has been one of the most enjoyable titles of its type that I have played in a long time. There are a few flaws that stop it from being truly great but it does what it sets out to do - provide a few hours of happy blood-lust carving a path of destruction through hordes of enemies.
The Bureau: XCOM Declassified,PlayStation 3,Aug-20-2013,2K Marin,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Tactical | Sci-Fi | Arcade,LaPS4,81,This adventurous title from 2K Marin is a very good example of a tactical shooter game. In spite of some unpolished details the fans of the saga will not be disappointed with The Bureau.
World of Warplanes,PC,Jul-2-2013,Wargaming.net | Persha Studia,Action | Simulation | Shooter | Flight | Shooter | Combat | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,XGN,90,Like an insane stunt pilot in the Red Bull Air Race World of Warplanes manages to leave an excellent impression. But Wargaming has to keep proving themselves in the future if they want us to remain impressed. Its easy to find great satisfaction however when you roam the games skies with Ride of the Valkyries on the background while youre bringing death and destruction in your own personal aircraft.
The Matrix: Path of Neo,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2005,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Stuff,95,Shockingly enough is actually pretty damn good. Sure it looks uglier than Ernest Borgnine in a tutu and trying to use the controls is like operating the Space Shuttle while wearing oven mitts but once you get the hang of it beating the Stove Top stuffing out of agents is terrific fun.
Phantasy Star Portable 2,PSP,Sep-13-2010,Alfa System,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Gamers' Temple,84,Basically if youve enjoyed this type of RPG before and have the time to get into a new one Phantasy Star Portable 2 is pretty much a must-buy.
Jack Keane,PC,Apr-15-2008,Legacy Interactive,Adventure | General | General,AceGamez,90,Jack Keane is the most enjoyable point-and-click adventure Ive played in a long time. It will appeal to almost every adventure fan as the puzzles gradually get harder while the game successfully reproduces the vibrant humorous and slick atmosphere and antics of beloved classics of this proud genre like Sam & Max and Monkey Island.
Arslan: The Warriors of Legend,PlayStation 4,Feb-9-2016,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Digitally Downloaded,90,In most other regards Arslan is a fairly standard Warriors experience but between the strong epic narrative gorgeous setting and the varied bunch of really enjoyable characters there is more than enough here to justify its place among Koei Tecmo’s growing stable of licensed work.
Silent Line: Armored Core,PlayStation 2,Jul-17-2003,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Mech,Gamestyle,100,An utterly superb game.
Football Manager 2019 Touch,Switch,Dec-6-2018,Sega,Sports | Team | Soccer | Management,GameSpew,90,Football Manager 2019 Touch is so much more than its iOS/Android namesake; it’s the beautiful game made even more beautiful.

FOX n FORESTS,PC,May-17-2018,Bonus Level Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hardcore Gamer,80,The core platforming and action-oriented combat work well as does the seasonal shifting mechanic. There’s a natural flow to the levels and exploration is rewarded — resulting in stages that are usually fun to play through again. The RPG mechanics are a bit too girnd-heavy for a platformer but allow you to extend your skills beyond most games in the genre while the rich graphics and robust sound deliver a satisfying experience for the eyes and ears.
.hack//G.U. Last Recode,PC,Nov-3-2017,CyberConnect2,Miscellaneous | Compilation,ZTGD,85,The release of .hack//G.U. Last Recode is a celebration of what I consider to be CyberConnect2’s greatest achievement in gaming thus far. It’s an excellent way for newcomers to experience one of the most underrated JRPGs in the lengthy and excellent catalogue of PS2 games. As for those like myself who loved the original- a chance to say hello to some old friends and finally erase that last bit of regret that’s been lingering all these years.
The Legend of Kusakari,3DS,Aug-25-2016,Librage,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,80,There’s a clever mix of addictiveness with basic gameplay to keep players going without getting them too irritated about the more difficult levels. Ultimately the experience of playing this mirrors Shiba Kari himself - the game will never be as notable as the heroes that exist in its world but humble as it is there is a real sense of satisfaction in clearing that field of long grass.
Mario Super Sluggers,Wii,Aug-25-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Arcade | Arcade,Games Master UK,80,A step back for Wii baseball controls but enough of a gameplay leap to warrant playing. [Sept 2008 p.70]

Moons of Madness,PC,Oct-22-2019,Rock Pocket Games,Action Adventure | Survival,Ragequit.gr,83,Moons of Madness may be the best implementation of traditional puzzle-solving weve seen so far in an interactive narrative experience in a setting that skillfully merges unearthly horrors with more tangible science fiction.
Brain Age: Concentration Training,3DS,Feb-10-2013,Nintendo,Edutainment | Miscellaneous | Edutainment,Gaming Nexus,85,While I did enjoy Brain Age: Concentration Training and still train every day with it there are some aspects I didn’t enjoy. Some of the Devilish Trainings can be just downright tedious and off-putting at times while the game’s handwriting recognition could use a bit of work. However if you can train enough days to unlock some of the other types of training it can still be a fun experience.
Duel Masters: Sempai Legends,Game Boy Advance,Jun-1-2004,Mistic Software,Miscellaneous | Card Battle,Into Liquid Sky,83,I understand the need to simplify things for use on the GBA but even the fact that all the spells use the same art seems a bit disappointing. With that said though the graphics do what they should - carry the solid gameplay through.
LEGO Worlds,Xbox One,Mar-7-2017,TT Games,Action Adventure | Sandbox,TheXboxHub,80,LEGO Worlds may not be built on the mighty foundation of survival and building but the content in place is certainly a welcome addition. Whilst the quests could certainly do with a little more inspiration it will be the infinite Master Builder possibilities with the many thousands of LEGO bricks available that you’ll be remembering this classic for.
Game of Thrones: Episode Two - The Lost Lords,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2015,Telltale Games,Action | Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,CGMagazine,90,Telltale has created [a] well-written instalment of the Game of Thrones game that will please fans of the show and stands on its own as a tense dramatic tale of intrigue politics and what families do to survive.
Warframe,PC,Mar-25-2013,Digital Extremes,General | Shooter | Sci-Fi | General | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,The Overpowered Noobs,80,Play Warframe. Play it for more than a few hours preferably with friends and keep an open mind into doing some third-party research to straighten out some of these systems. Warframe takes so much of what makes ARPG’s addictive and rounds it out with more polish and depth than most its competitors on the current games market. If the hooks aren’t deeply embedded by then maybe something this in-depth isn’t for you.
Quake Arena Arcade,Xbox 360,Dec-15-2010,id Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamingXP,87,The trip to Vietnam leaves us with mixed feelings. On the one hand the add-on keeps the high standard of the main game but on the other hand there are not many new things. Despite the few vehicles and minor changes in the weapon section there isnt much new to discover.
Overland,PC,Sep-19-2019,Finji,Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,Vandal,82,Overland proves once again the talent of the team behind it with a challenging and original adventure that relies on a solid turn-based strategy and survival-oriented gameplay.

State of Decay 2,PC,May-22-2018,Undead Labs,Action Adventure | Open-World,Quarter to Three,100,Besides polish is overrated. Consider Dawn of the Dead. Both of them. Zack Justice League Snyder’s update is polished contemporary and appropriately dumb. But Romero’s original is raw uneven and still powerful. They each have their place but only one of them is timeless. If you want the fullest and most thorough expression of zombie mythology in a movie you watch Romero’s Dawn of the Dead. If you want the fullest and most thorough expression of zombie mythology in a game you play Undead Labs’ State of Decay 2.
Thunder Wolves,PC,May-15-2013,Most Wanted Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Gaming Nexus,85,Thunder Wolves is a great shoot em up with a hint of tactical finesse required now and then. It certainly packs quite a bit of bang for your bucks. Grab another controller and a good friend to have even more fun in the co-op multiplayer mode.
Frogger: Helmet Chaos,DS,Sep-27-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,WHAM! Gaming,90,Its a treat to play something so fresh and yet so (often frustratingly) familiar. Helmet Chaos strikes the perfect balance between its 20th Century lineage and gameplay for today.
Call of Duty 3,Wii,Nov-14-2006,Exakt,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PGNx Media,93,Call of Duty 3 is a great showcase for the Wii’s unique control scheme. While the Wii controls work with other games of the games we’ve played so far Call of Duty 3 is the one that most benefits from the motion sensing controls.
Dragon Marked For Death,Switch,Mar-26-2019,Inti Creates,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Nintendo Enthusiast,90,Dragon Marked for Death is one of the most rewarding sidescrolling games I have played ever and it’s easily recommended due to its immense polish.
Akane,Switch,May-17-2019,Ludic Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Pure Nintendo,90,Akane is a delightful twin-stick shooter that focuses primarily on melee combat and wants the player to use their firearms sparingly. Mix this with the delightful graphics and upgrades and there is a lot of fun to be had with this game.
Slain: Back from Hell,Xbox One,Oct-21-2016,Digerati Distribution | Digerati,Action | Platformer | 2D,DarkStation,80,Perhaps the main reason why Slain: Back from Hell is both a successful tribute to the old school gaming and a damn good game in its own right is the track record of its developers. They really did some of those Amiga games I grew up with back in the day. A heartfelt thanks to the graphics artist and the man behind the concept Andrew Gilmour and his co-developers for taking me back to my teen years. A time machine isn’t invented yet but Slain: Back from Hell is surely the next best thing. Those pampered modern gamers might think otherwise as the game takes a good chunk of old school masochism to go with it.
Exist Archive: The Other Side of the Sky,PlayStation 4,Oct-18-2016,Tri-Ace,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Gaming Age,83,But hey: if you’re a fan of dungeon crawlers chances are you probably don’t mind a bit of repetition and backtracking. Exist Archive has a bit of a unique spin on the genre but I imagine that it’s not so different that it’ll alienate anyone who wants to grind their way through dungeon after dungeon. At the same time though it’s easy to imagine that it’s the kind of game that really could appeal to a wider range of people than just its core audience.
Scaler,GameCube,Nov-17-2004,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | Platformer | 3D,Next Level Gaming,80,Scaler is fun and easy to play. Its colorful characters will be sure to satisfy the children out there.
Octodad: Dadliest Catch,PC,Jan-30-2014,Young Horses | Inc,Modern | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person | Modern,GamesBeat,91,Octodad is a great example of a game that conveys a message through gameplay. In conjunction with its story characters and setting the controls offer an empathetic look into the life of an extreme outsider trying to fit in and trying to do right by his family...I love that. Gaming is growing up and Octodad is some of the best evidence of that.
Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain,PlayStation 4,Apr-11-2019,Yuke's,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,ZTGD,85,It is probably the purest throw back to the run and gun shooters of old.

Crash Nitro Kart,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Vicarious Visions,Driving | Racing | Kart,GamePro,90,While CNK may not break new ground it does a quality job of delivering another kart racer in Crash’s universe. It will put gamers mettle to the test and offer hours of wait one more time... gameplay.
Clock Tower 3,PlayStation 2,Mar-18-2003,SunSoft,Action Adventure | Horror,Cheat Code Central,90,The graphic violence is shocking. The story is captivating and the disturbing scenes are sure to make even hardcore gamers a little queasy.
Ultima Online: Third Dawn,PC,Mar-26-2001,Electronic Arts,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,GameZone,80,New features aside this is the original Ultima Online spiced up a bit but hoping to appeal to a new core of gamers. In reality what this game offers is a cyber place to meet greet and do battle.
Burnout Crash!,PlayStation 3,Sep-20-2011,Criterion Games,Action | Driving | Car Combat | Arcade | Car Combat,TotalPlayStation,85,Burnout CRASH! sounded like a disaster when we first heard about it but the final product is a pleasant diversion that captures the feel of the old Crash Mode and should provide plenty of enjoyment to longtime series fans.

Resident Evil 5,PlayStation 4,Jun-28-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,PlayStation Universe,80,Resident Evil 5 suffers from duff AI and a few other niggles but is overall a fantastic content-packed action game with brilliant co-op appeal.
The Matrix Online,PC,Mar-22-2005,Monolith Productions,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Game Chronicles,100,Not only is this an amazing game as far as games and MMOG’s go but it is also a unique storytelling experiment. One that has never been attempted before and one that I am extremely excited to be taking part in.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Historic | Action Adventure | General | Linear,ActionTrip,90,This $10 standalone game is far longer than most $60 games and I still have the New Game Plus mode to try and unlock the rest of Shao Jun’s abilities.
Medal of Honor Heroes 2,PSP,Nov-13-2007,EA LA,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,IGN,84,Medal of Honor Heroes 2 is already a better overall effort than last year though it adds in a ton of event gameplay and diversity in exchange for a relatively short single player campaign and relies heavily on its online offerings.
Tony Hawk's Project 8,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,Shaba Games,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Game Chronicles,89,If you must play the game on the old PS2 youll still have a good time; albeit a lonely time. Just dont play it on the 360 or PS3 or you might never be satisfied with your classic system again. Tony has definitely made the jump to next-gen and you might want to do the same.
Raging Justice,Xbox One,May-8-2018,MakinGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Windows Central,90,Aside from the disappointing lack of playable characters Raging Justice is an impressive blast from the past that puts a forgotten style of fighting game on center stage and shows why its still fun all these years later. Its a fighting game youll love.
Fragments of Him,PC,May-3-2016,Sassybot,Adventure | Visual Novel,IGN Italia,90,A beautiful smart mature and emotionally deep experiment in interactive narration. If you’re looking for traditional gameplay though stay as far as possible from it.

Paperbound,PlayStation 4,Mar-31-2015,Dissident Logic,Action | Fighting | 2D,PSNStores,80,As it stands the game is a must-own if you have a consistent group of 3-4 players.
Lichdom: Battlemage,PC,Mar-19-2014,Xaviant Games | Xaviant,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | First-Person | Linear | Western-Style,CD-Action,80,After the first 5 hours I was delighted with Lichdom shocked by its awesomeness even. Then repetitiveness reared its ugly head and my enthusiasm started fading especially when around the 12 hour mark (when the game should have ended for its own sake) I realized that the story is far from over. Anyhow Lichdom has a spark that makes you want to come back to it and the spell crafting system is truly amazing. It’s just better to enjoy it in small doses. [Nov 2014 p.68]
The LEGO Movie Videogame,Xbox One,Feb-7-2014,TT Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,EGM,85,Another smash-and-collect game featuring everyone’s favorite building toy. This time around it’s based on the new animated movie and offers many of the hilarious characters fresh off the screen.

Ultimately The LEGO Movie Videogame is great fun and perfect for fans of the fantastic plastic.

From Russia With Love,PlayStation 2,Nov-1-2005,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Modern,eToychest,83,A fun game that does a really good job of making you feel as if you are taking part in a classic-era Bond film. Unfortunately the overall linearity and lack of a significant multiplayer mode ensures that this is a game that will be played through once and then left on the shelf.
Snake Pass,PlayStation 4,Mar-28-2017,Sumo Digital,Action Adventure | Puzzle | Action | General,Eurogamer Italy,80,A puzzle-platform in which you can’t jump might seem like an odd idea but Snake Pass reveals itself as a great game despite some rough edges and a sometimes ruthless difficulty.

Theres nothing really original here but nonetheless Tembo is incredibly fun. Kudos to Game Freak.
Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers,3DS,May-24-2018,Nintendo | Vanpool,Action | General,ZTGD,85,Dillon’s Dead Heat Breakers is a great title unfortunately released during a mass exodus from the 3DS to the Switch. It’s a shame because Dillon and his pal Russ are a great set of characters and the world they live in definitely could be explored even further but likely won’t as this series never really took off the way I think Nintendo hoped it would.
Conan,PlayStation 3,Oct-23-2007,Nihilistic,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Pelit (Finland),85,Conan is at its best visceral and furious fun with limbs and heads flying. Unfortunately the adrenaline level drops when the speed slows down on harder adversaries and when the enemies do not have limbs to detach or heads to pop. Also boss fights tend to follow the same pattern too much. Still it is worth the time and effort. Experimenting with different moves never gets old. [Oct 2007]
State of Mind,PC,Aug-15-2018,Daedalic Entertainment,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,Hooked Gamers,90,Despite a few drawbacks and narrative tangles State of Mind is a great game that I had a ton of fun playing. The attention thats gone into creating an engaging world results in an experience that has a lot to offer anyone willing to be a more passive participant in the engaging experience. It’s a slow burn the perfect game to relax with for a few evenings like a season of a good tv show.

Danger Zone 2,Xbox One,Jul-10-2018,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Age,83,It’s not quite the full spiritual successor to Burnout that we need but it’ll certainly do the job until that arrives.
Imperial Glory,PC,May-17-2005,Pyro Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Total Video Games,90,The implementation of controllable sea battles and the interactive environments certainly develops the gameplay of the combat RTS sub-genre and it’s sure to be a feature that a certain developer called Creative Assembly will be looking out for.
Ultimate NES Remix,3DS,Nov-7-2014,Indies Zero,Miscellaneous | General,God is a Geek,90,Ultimate NES Remix brings the terrific NES Remix series to the 3DS making the leap from console to mobile with consummate ease.

Darksiders III,Xbox One,Nov-27-2018,Gunfire Games | THQ Nordic,Action Adventure | Open-World,GameSpew,90,Sure it’s not as polished as the likes of God of War but I don’t care. When Darksiders III works well it’s just as entertaining. I love its character and enemy designs; its world draws you in and surprises you with the way all of its environments are linked together; and it really does have some epic boss fights. Throw in some light puzzling and an engaging story and you have a no-frills adventure game that somehow feels fresh.
Dragon Ball: Xenoverse,PlayStation 4,Feb-24-2015,Dimps Corporation,Action | Fighting | 3D,NZGamer,89,Overall Dragon Ball Xenoverse is probably one of the best if not the best Dragon Ball related games out there – and there are a lot. You can replay missions to enhance your character. There are various trainers to go on missions for. It also has time travelling - and that’s always a good thing.

Biology Battle,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,Novaleaf Game Studios,Action | General,GameFocus,85,One of the more expensive XNA Community Games out there at 800 Microsoft Points (about 10 bucks) this might detract some players given that it’s a Community Game; however the sharp professional quality mixed with addictive gameplay and expansive game selection makes Biology Battle quite the bargain.
SingStar Rocks!,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Cheat Code Central,86,This is a great package but the song list is always going to be a bone of contention with singers as the variety of songs is too wide to please everyone. There are already five different variations of this game released in Europe and we should see more focused song lists in the future.
MotoGP,PSP,Sep-26-2006,Namco Bandai Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,PSW Magazine UK,80,Online or off MotoGP is a very slick racing experience and its deceptively simplistic gameplay hides a very effective control system and devastatingly addictive racing.

Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jul-2-2013,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Arcade,ZTGD,87,With everyone’s attention being steered towards Call of Duty: Ghosts it’s great to see that Treyarch still have their eye on the ball. Buried may have finally ‘buried’ my interest in the Zombie mode but let’s not forget the real reason why people are still playing Black Ops 2 online; the amazing selection of maps and Vengeance has just added four new killer ones to the mix.
Screencheat,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Samurai Punk,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Arcade,Digitally Downloaded,80,Screencheat is my favourite local multiplayer game on the PlayStation 4. It’s a nice small download that I’m going to leave sitting on the harddrive for whenever I have friends over and while that might not happen on a weekly basis (I like my space okay) each and every time I pull the game out it’s going to more than validate its worth.

Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIV,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2020,Koei Tecmo Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | 4X,Digitally Downloaded,100,This reward that Romance of the Three Kingdoms offers is subtle and nuanced. This is a niche game and I would very much expect its sales to be much lower than what its rival achieved. Its the better experience though from a particular perspective. If you love your historical strategy for the history that they depict then Romance of the Three Kingdoms delivers. Everything about it is a perfect reflection on what that book was on about.

It's Quiz Time,PlayStation 4,Nov-28-2017,Vision Games Publishing LTD,Miscellaneous | Trivia / Game Show,Gaming Age,91,Whereas games like Knowledge is Power or Jeopardy! felt a little (or in Jeopardy!’s case very) impersonal It’s Quiz Time feels like it’s tailoring its experience to the individuals playing at that moment. That generic androgynous robot (Salli for the record) turns out to be funny and is constantly trash-talking and praising players by name. This extends to the app/controller as well with tailored messages flashing on each player’s screen at the end of every round giving them text they can share via social media that say how well they did in a particular round (note: I did not do this). Add in the personalized stats at the end of the game and you can see why It’s Quiz Time is so much better than its competition.
Liberation Maiden,3DS,Oct-25-2012,Grasshopper Manufacture,General | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GameSpot,85,A striking action-packed shoot-em-up thats up there with the best in the genre.

Metal Slug 4 & 5,Xbox,Aug-21-2005,BrezzaSoft,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Game Over Online,85,Itd be a little more worthwhile if an arcade-perfect Metal Slug 3 had been included in the collection but this is still a must-have for those of us who fondly remember our local arcade.

The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,Xbox,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Play Magazine,85,With any luck Kromes overhaul will prove lucrative enough to warrant them continuing the brand flying Spyro into next-gen skies and who knows perhaps a veritable rebirth. [Oct. 2006 p.54]

The addictive mecha fighting is almost flawless but its complemented by so many other incredible parts to the game.

For now all we can keep hoping for in each new game is increased accuracy larger rosters better treatment of female wrestlers and fresher color commentary.
Felix the Reaper,Xbox One,Oct-17-2019,Kong Orange,Adventure | General,Xbox Tavern,83,Although somewhat unusual in its theming the level of detail and extensive research that has gone into the making of Felix the Reaper is vast and perhaps this is why it stands out so significantly.

POD: Speedzone,Dreamcast,Dec-5-2000,Ubisoft Romania,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,GamerWeb Sega,97,POD SpeedZone scratches a long-standing itch: A simple multiplayer racing game thats beginner-friendly but rewards the persistent.

Conan Exiles,PC,May-8-2018,Funcom,Action Adventure | Survival,Shacknews,90,It’s not perfect (and carries many of the warts that are now tropes of the survival genre) but I’ve yet to find myself bored or disillusioned with any part of the experience. Like any game Conan Exiles is best played with friends (and this game is AMAZING with a group of idiot friends). A battle to the death with 6 naked cannibals and a giant tiger is hands down the best gaming experience I’ve had in 2018.
Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2008,Jupiter Corporation,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Worth Playing,90,Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories for the PS2 is definitely worth checking out especially if you havent yet played the GBA original.

Layers of Fear 2,PlayStation 4,May-28-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,Digitally Downloaded,90,I wish more horror games were like Layers of Fear 2. Its a mature and intelligent understanding of the deeper and more meaningful elements of horror and while I can have as much fun as anyone creeping around a Resident Evil game and shooting the ugly monsters while being startled by the jump scares its something like this that I end up reflecting on well after Ive finished playing and this is the kind of game that I return to when Im looking for an actual horror experience.
WWE 2K17,Xbox One,Oct-11-2016,Yuke's,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,IGN,82,WWE 2K17 doesn’t make any big drastic changes but its smart gameplay tweaks have revitalized match types I’d ignored the past few years. I really miss 2K Showcase and 2K17 is still weak in areas that I feel should have been shored up by now but its excellent combat and generous amounts of customization help it retain its title.

With having to solve puzzles against the clock it really feels as if your decisions matter due to gut punching consequences.
BioShock Infinite: Clash in the Clouds,Xbox 360,Jul-30-2013,Irrational Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,LevelUp,82,Clash in the Clouds offers a great opportunity to delve in those action filled moments we all loved in the original game. Although killing wave after wave of enemies in 4 different maps might get old relatively quickly the implementation of the Blue Ribbons adds variety to gameplay and require a higher strategy level.
Madden NFL 09,PSP,Aug-12-2008,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Sim | Sim,GameDaily,80,A Rookie mode simplifies the controls for beginners (dont worry you still have Advanced controls) and theres Franchise mode and the Madden Moments from the console editions (called Superstar Challenge) but the on-field action looks and sounds too similar to last years game.
Tom Clancy's EndWar,PC,Feb-24-2009,Ubisoft Shanghai,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | Military | Tactics,SpazioGames,82,Tom Clancys Endwar is an innovative RTS suitable both for the genre-fan and the newbie.

Lost Sphear,PlayStation 4,Jan-23-2018,Tokyo RPG Factory,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,100,Lost Sphear as with I Am Setsuna before it is a beautiful heartfelt bit of classical Japanese videogame storytelling. It’s not a game that you should be playing for the gameplay in so much as it wraps nostalgia and some more modern ideas together in order to tell something that is both memorable and soulful. It’s a beautiful emotive game and with it Tokyo RPG Factory has cemented itself as one of my favourite JRPG outfits going around.
Metrico,PlayStation Vita,Aug-5-2014,Digital Dreams,General | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General,Pocket Gamer UK,90,Metrico is a beautiful imaginative and ingenious puzzle game with an original idea at its heart and some seriously sharp brainteasers.

Steel Rats,PC,Nov-7-2018,Tate Multimedia,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,Jeuxvideo.com,85,Even if it enjoys a nice art direction cool audio and nice level-design Steel Rats hardly deploys its full potential mostly because of a poorly calibrated gameplay.
Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure,3DS,Sep-24-2013,5TH Cell,Puzzle | Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Nintendojo,75,Scribblenauts Unmasked is a fun title. It takes the best elements of the series and combines them with the DC Universe in a way that feels natural and fun. Developer 5th Cell has painstakingly mined the DC Universe and delivered a game that really takes advantage of the license.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - Stimulus Package,Xbox 360,Mar-30-2010,Infinity Ward,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Play.tm,80,It accomplishes what it sets out to do but the Stimulus Package feels closer to a shot of caffeine than it does adrenaline.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood,Xbox One,Jul-26-2019,MachineGames,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Impulsegamer,90,This game does not really break new ground but it is a good meat and potatoes shooter and has been well designed and promises to be an enjoyable game to play with friends.

Tiny Metal,PC,Dec-21-2017,AREA35,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Hardcore Gamer,80,Tiny Metal doesn’t copy the Advance Wars formula — it improves it. The third dimension brings with it a better way to do battle and tell where your enemies are. This change allows the tactical side of combat to flourish in a new way and one anyone who enjoys the Wars games will find it fun. It controls easily with a base controller and while PC users can get a bit of an edge using a mouse to traverse maps it isn’t a game-breaking issue for those prefer a pad. It’s a gorgeous-looking game with a cartoony art style that adds a touch of slapstick to battles which remain funny thanks to voice clips that entertain until they get a bit too long in the tooth due to repetition. Minor quibbles aside though Tiny Metal is an excellent tactical RPG at the end of the day and one that longtime fans of the genre should check out.
Ninjala,Switch,Jun-24-2020,GungHo Online Entertainment America | Inc.,Action | General,Hardcore Gamer,80,Ninjala is a well-crafted game and another fine example of free-to-play done right. You can make steady progress in the online game without spending real-world money and the only part of the game behind a paywall is the single player campaign — which is currently in its first phase. GungHo has done a great job early on at making a fun experience for players of all skill levels and still providing enough depth to sink your teeth into things when you want to. Ninjala isn’t just a great free-to-play game it’s a great game period and one well-worth checking out on Switch.

Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds,PC,Nov-18-2003,Secret Level,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Worth Playing,84,Magic players might like it as a diversion from the card game or they might hate it with its dumbing down and changing of the rules.
Whiplash,Xbox,Nov-18-2003,Crystal Dynamics,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamePro,90,Filled with enough chaos and wicked humor to forgive the slight reliance on platform clichés Whiplash really is a hell of a game. With a little more polish before release this game could have been a true masterpiece.
RoadKill,Xbox,Oct-13-2003,Terminal Reality,Driving | Car Combat,Official Xbox Magazine,86,If you can stomach the story problems the spotty humor and the lack of originality and simply focus on the gameplay then youll enjoy Roadkill for what it is... and addictive combination of two more inventive titles. [Nov 2003 p.104]
O.R.B.,PC,Nov-4-2002,Strategy First,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpy,87,No major breakthrough but it is an exceptional outing suited to longtime RTS fans and newcomers alike.
Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths,PC,Oct-31-2002,Prograph,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Just Adventure,91,It has been so long since we have had a comic adventure game that I think it is a relief to just have some fun and enjoy some ridiculous puzzles (and might I add puzzles that are purposely meant to be ridiculous).
Sega Bass Fishing Duel,PlayStation 2,Sep-23-2002,Wow Entertainment,Sports | Nature | Fishing,Gaming Age,83,With a wide variety of options fish lures modes and lakes Sega has done it again by producing a fun and addicting title for fans and non-fans alike.

Disney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle,Game Boy Advance,Sep-14-2002,Digital Eclipse,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpy,84,It never gets quite as fun or inventive as any of the Mario or Rayman platform games but Tarzan: Return to the Jungle holds its own surprisingly well and is a must-have for fans of its GBC predecessor.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger,Xbox,Sep-10-2002,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,GameSpy,82,Its a fun romp that often lacks originality.
Battlecruiser Millennium,PC,Nov-18-2001,3000AD | Inc.,Strategy | General | General,PC Gamer,77,Its incredible depth certainly nets the game some major kudos but theres a serious caveat in the near absence of any structured gameplay. [Dec 2001 p.100]

Unison: Rebels of Rhythm & Dance,PlayStation 2,Mar-22-2001,Tecmo,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Daily Radar,88,A blast to play. The game oozes style in the same way that Space Channel 5 did and the control scheme uses the dual sticks of the PS2 controller better than anything since Ape Escape.
Metal Fatigue,PC,Jul-31-2000,Zono Inc.,Strategy | Real-Time | General | General,ActionTrip,87,With its catchy graphics and refreshing gameplay ideas it turned my skepticism into a full-fledged addictive gaming experience.
Agents of Mayhem,PC,Aug-15-2017,Volition Inc.,Action Adventure | Open-World,Quarter to Three,100,Agents of Mayhem stands mightily on its own. This is not just an open-world Overwatch. This is not just Saints Row with superheroes. This is a masterpiece that’s been waiting for 30 years to bust out from the collection of talent at Volition. For a number of reasons it demands a place among the best of the best.
Starblood Arena,PlayStation 4,Apr-11-2017,WhiteMoon Dreams,Action | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,90,StarBlood Arena is VR’s Overwatch. Oozing with personality it explodes with a style and grace that one might not expect to come from the scrappiest corners of the galaxy. The tight frenetic combat takes some standard shooter ideas and literally turns them on their head putting you in the pilot’s seat in a way only possible with virtual reality. If you haven’t taken the plunge StarBlood Arena is a damn good reason to get PSVR. If you already own one I’ll see you in the arena.
Danger Zone 2,PlayStation 4,Jul-13-2018,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,IGN,82,Danger Zone 2 is exactly what I wanted the first Danger Zone to be: the true follow-up to Burnout’s classic Crash mode that EA won’t give me. It’s not as fully fleshed out or polished as my dream game of this type would be but as a self-contained and one-note smash-up it shines like a spectacular fireball explosion. Now how about reviving the rest of Burnout? Road Rage mode anyone?
Rush: A Disney / Pixar Adventure,Xbox One,Oct-31-2017,Asobo Studio,Miscellaneous | Adventure | General | Party / Minigame,Windows Central,80,Awkward movement controls always held the original game back but now Rush plays great with a controller – and you can still use the Kinect if thats your thing.

Cold Fear,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Darkworks,Action Adventure | Horror,Next Level Gaming,88,It has a very good storyline backed by some great character design and some very good scares.
MARVEL Powers United VR,PC,Jul-26-2018,Sanzaru Games,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Destructoid,80,If youre looking for an epic sprawling all-star experience this isnt it but I hope this fun brawl-focused base eventually leads to that and continues to improve over time with the promised upcoming support.

Dark Arcana: The Carnival,Xbox One,Mar-17-2017,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object,ICXM,75,Dark Arcana: The Carnival offers a great experience overall. Perhaps more engaging for a younger audience but still decent fun for all ages. A bit more creativity in names voice acting and puzzle types would make this a truly stellar game though it’s worth a creepy playthrough if only to follow the story and enjoy the sinister scenery. Dark Arcana: The Carnival proves hidden objects games can be deep and engaging.
Crimecraft: Bleedout,PC,Dec-4-2010,Vogster,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,GamingXP,77,Crimecraft: Bleedout offers many opportunities to customize your character but it looks like a remake of All Points Bulletin.

Mercenaries Saga Chronicles,Switch,Feb-8-2018,RideonJapan |Inc.,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Compilation | Tactics,Multiplayer.it,72,Mercenaries Saga Chronicles doesnt shine in any of its aspect but the volume of its content and the almost total absence of contenders make it a good choice for strategy lovers.
One Piece: Unlimited World Red - Deluxe Edition,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2017,Ganbarion,Action | General,Worth Playing,85,One Piece: Unlimited World Red Deluxe Edition is a great choice for anyone whos a fan of the anime show or genre. It offers an original story from the creator of the One Piece universe and it features smooth combat a gorgeous world that has clearly received a lot of development attention a ton of DLC and its wallet-friendly to boot. My only nitpicks have to do with the camera being too close to the character which interrupted the fluidity of traversing the world and there were a few slow points in the story due to a lack of clarity in missions. If youre looking for a fun and lighthearted adventure you cant go wrong with this title.
Inside My Radio,PC,May-11-2015,Seaven Studio,Action | Platformer | 2D,Vandal,80,Inside my Radio is a great platformer that deserves more attention. Its not perfect but its very addictive and when you beat it you just want more.
Silent Hill: Downpour,Xbox 360,Mar-13-2012,Konami,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Worth Playing,85,Even with an upsetting frame rate and poorly implemented combat Silent Hill: Downpour is the best weve seen in years. I enjoyed Shattered Memories but that felt more like a slightly interactive story than a video game whereas Downpour lets you explore Silent Hill in a way that hasnt been seen since Silent Hill 3.
Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals,PC,Sep-20-2008,White Birds Productions,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,IGN,82,A challenge worth taking on. Its fun to look at fun to play and its even fun to call someone you feel might be a bit smarter than you and drag them over to look at a tricky part.
UEFA EURO 2008,PSP,May-19-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,Pocket Gamer UK,80,A real European Champion. If only we could say the same about England.
The Technomancer,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Spiders,Role-Playing | General | Western-Style,ICXM,80,While the cause and effect mechanics may not be as fleshed out as in modern titles like The Witcher 3 The Technomancer blends enough new qualities with vintage attributes in order to create an authentic world and a whole bunch of electric fun.
Gungnir,PSP,Jun-12-2012,Sting,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,RPG Fan,92,If youre a more casual RPG player you might want to give Gungnir a pass but if you are a connoisseur of the SRPG genre then Gungnir will delight you like few other games will.

Zoo Tycoon,Xbox One,Nov-22-2013,Frontier Developments,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Post Arcade (National Post),85,This is a polished full-fledged very fun game. You’ll buy it for your kids so they don’t feel left out of the next-gen joy but once they go to bed you may well end up spending as much time designing your dream zoo as they do...Maybe more.
Cloudberry Kingdom,Xbox 360,Jul-31-2013,Pwnee Studios,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,God is a Geek,90,While later levels can get incredibly difficult Pwnee Studios absolutely nailed the difficulty curve and Story Mode completion is attainable for the majority of players thanks to some well-implemented player aids.
Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break,Switch,Jul-21-2020,ACE Team,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,Theres nothing else quite like Rock of Ages out there. Its a mesh of things that shouldnt work together and thats why I suspect no one else has tried to replicate the mad genius of ACE Teams work. Yes Rock of Ages 3 has some mild issues with pacing and the loading times could be better to suit the experimentation that is at the core of the experience but this is also the definitive version of something that is very funny ideal for both single-player and multiplayer parties and thanks to that most excellent course designer Rock of Ages 3 is functionally endless.
Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game,Switch,Oct-8-2019,Cyanide | Saber3D,Role-Playing | General,GameSpace,85,What it does have in spades is the Lovecraft mythos and it does it very well.
Killing Floor: Incursion,PlayStation 4,May-1-2018,Tripwire Interactive,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,90,The tension ratchets unbelievably high and the simple act of peeking around a corner can lead to coronary trauma when you realize that something is standing right behind you. Like any good rollercoaster ride Killing Floor Incursion delivers the chills and the fun in equal measure and is well worth the price of admission.
Black The Fall,Xbox One,Jul-11-2017,Sand Sailor Studio,Action | General,TheXboxHub,90,I love games that are clever beautifully designed tell an amazing story and make you feel for something or someone. Black the Fall ticks all my boxes.
Heart&Slash,Xbox One,Jun-24-2016,AHEARTFULOFGAMES,Action | General,TrueAchievements,80,Heart&Slash is a highly fun game that presents a real challenge and requires a lot of determination in order to progress. Unfortunately the sporadic camera spoils what would have been a great game.
Q.U.B.E. Director's Cut,Wii U,Sep-10-2015,Toxic Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Logic,Brash Games,80,To me there is no doubt that Q.U.B.E Directors Cut is a very decent Eshop offering. If you are looking for a unique puzzler with an interesting storyline and great presentation I would say you go a lot worse than this one for your money.
Master Spy,PC,Sep-8-2015,TURBOGUN,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hardcore Gamer,90,This game is not for everyone and if you didn’t grow up on super-hard games that tested every reflect it probably isn’t going to be a game you enjoy. However it is an absolute must-buy for anyone who loves a challenge. It controls perfectly looks and sounds great and does everything it sets out to do nearly flawlessly.
Shad'O,PC,Sep-4-2012,Okugi Studio,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Defense,Everyeye.it,75,ShadO is a classic tower defense characterized by a beautiful artistic design and a fairytale atmosphere. Unfortunately it is quite repetitious and it has some difficulty balancing issues.
Castlevania: Harmony of Despair,PlayStation 3,Sep-27-2011,Konami,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Pelit (Finland),80,The amount of money a player has to spend in order to get all out of this game is ridiculous especially when all of the content is recycled from older games. The multiplayer is pretty fun though. [Feb 2012]
F1 2009,PSP,Nov-16-2009,Sumo Digital,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Formula One | Formula One | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,82,The single-player is jam-packed with varied game modes.

Stoked,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2009,Bongfish,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Snowboarding | Snowboarding | Ski / Snowboard,Impulsegamer,85,In conclusion Stoked is probably one of the most competent snowboarding games available that although has a rather high learning curve if you do manage to put in the time the gameplay mechanics will definitely be rewarding enough.
Sherlock Holmes: The Silver Earring,PC,Sep-28-2004,Frogwares,Adventure | General | General,GamingTrend,93,A wonderful package. Dont wait on the bargain bin for this one as it is worth the price from the get go.

Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception,PlayStation 4,May-23-2017,Aqua Plus,Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,Its quite unfortunate for the sake of the game that Utawarerumono just happens to come out in a rare period when there are a lot of tactics RPGs to choose between. Fire Emblem and Disgaea both have far higher profiles and those respective games will get the bulk of the attention but for something a little more beautiful than Disgaea a little more humorous than Fire Emblem and genuinely focused on the narrative Utawarerumono is my pick of the bunch.
Joust,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,Digital Eclipse,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,VGPub,76,A remake with its heart in the right place but its mind in the gutter.

Overlord: Dark Legend,Wii,Jun-23-2009,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,NintendoWorldReport,85,A damn fine game when all is said and done. Its a focused linear experience that never really slows down.
Kinect Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2012,Asobo Studio,Adventure | General | General,Everyeye.it,80,Considering its target Kinect Rush is a well designed game that can entertain with ease lots of kids making them move a lot.
Gundam Versus,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2017,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Simulation | Fighting | Vehicle | 3D | Combat,CD-Action,95,One of the best and most popular series from Japanese arcades finally travels to the West.

Heroki,Switch,Jul-20-2018,Picomy,Action | General,DarkStation,80,Heroki combines the premise of infinite flight with a potpourri of platformer elements. Its beautiful art style and adorable mascot hearken back to classic 16-bit adventures. The ability to fly instead of run is refreshing and Heroki’s responsive controls lessen frustration. This helps when exploring the compact mazelike levels that are abundant with secrets. It may not be a hard game but less experienced players and those who loved the heyday of 2D sidescrollers can appreciate this true blue hero.
Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom,PC,Apr-18-2017,Enigami,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Everyeye.it,78,Quotation forthcoming.
White Night,PC,Mar-3-2015,OSome Studio,Action Adventure | Survival,4Players.de,80,Despite some heavy trial-and-error and jagged edges White Night combines mansion horror like Resident Evil with an intriguing black and white art design.
Rogue Stormers,PC,Jul-17-2014,Black Forest Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,IGN Spain,82,An interesting proposal that mixes two different kinds of games like Runn gun and roguelikes. It could be much more varied on its design but Rogue Stormers manages to entertain anyone who wants to face its challenge.
Buccaneer: The Pursuit of Infamy,PC,Dec-5-2008,Stickmen Studios,Strategy | General | General,DarkStation,80,Buccaneer is a fun game made by a pair of very talented designers. The graphics are top notch and some of the best I have ever seen in an independent game.

Crash Bash,PlayStation,Nov-6-2000,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Miscellaneous | Party,Game Fan,90,I for one will be giving multiple copies of Crash Bash and multi-taps to family and friends this holiday and that alone should speak miles on just how addictive and fun this game can be in a multiplayer environment.

Keepsake,PC,Mar-31-2006,Wicked Studios,Adventure | Third-Person | Point-and-Click | Fantasy | Fantasy,Game Over Online,87,It has a couple of problems here and there (like odd echoes to the dialogue) but it sports a couple dozen intriguing puzzles it’s well made and it’s well acted.
Project Nimbus: Complete Edition,Switch,May-16-2019,GameCrafterTeam,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Pure Nintendo,80,Project Nimbus: Complete Edition is a fast-paced action-packed shooter with smooth controls vivid graphics and three different modes to keep you busy for a while. At the price of $20 it’s worth a try.

Remothered: Tormented Fathers,Xbox One,Jul-25-2018,Stormind Games,Action Adventure | Survival,Xbox Tavern,81,A must have for any fan of horror. The game’s eerie atmosphere makes for some great scares with its gory cutscenes and psychotic characters collectively relaying a truly 90s-esque horrific experience. The controls are clunky at times and enemy position isn’t always made clear but with most of the other bugs now remedied ahead of release I highly recommend giving this a go.
de Blob 2,PlayStation 4,Feb-27-2018,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Video Chums,78,Even though I prefer the arcade feel of the first game de Blob 2 is certainly a must-have 3D platformer. Considering Blue Tongue Entertainment is no longer around I hope THQ Nordic gets a developer to finally create a third game some time down the road.
Nom Nom Galaxy,PC,Aug-3-2014,Q-Games,Action | General,Softpedia,75,Nom Nom Galaxy is an interesting hybrid although the variety of experiences might mean that a lot of players will have to fail a lot before they discover exactly how to approach the problem of soup production and shipping.
Chronos Twins DX,Wii,Jan-11-2010,EnjoyUp Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Console Monster,80,Aqua Panic is bright cheerful and likely to put a smile on your face even in the deepest of saturated situations.

They have learned their lesson and this time we have the Star Wars game we all deserve with enough variety and a lot of content for every kind of player.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2005,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,84,The relative ease of the gameplay and the downplay of violence makes this an excellent game for kids of all ages - yet its not completely sucky. A first-rate adventure for everyone.
Kill la Kill: IF,PlayStation 4,Jul-26-2019,Studio TRIGGER | Aplus,Action Adventure | General | Action | Fighting | 3D,TheSixthAxis,90,Kill La Kill -IF- may just be the perfect anime video game. It almost flawlessly manages to embrace the style and energy of the original anime and translate that into an enthralling arena fighter that is just as much fun solo as it is competitively. The art is incredible the music is astounding and the story mode goes above and beyond to deliver a fresh narrative that fans of the anime will eat up. Whether youre a Kill La Kill megafan or just a fighting game enthusiast this is a must play.
Strange Brigade,PC,Aug-28-2018,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,GameGrin,90,I wasn’t expecting a huge amount from Strange Brigade but what I got was a really enjoyable experience both offline and online. This was a pleasant surprise as generally I’m not someone who would usually play online if I can avoid it. The fact that even I preferred playing online speaks volumes about Rebellion’s efforts in making a game that’s best played in co-op. There are a few things that could have been done better but nothing that can’t be overlooked. This is one of my favourite multiplayer games in a very long time.
