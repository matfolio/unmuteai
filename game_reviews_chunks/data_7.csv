Alien Breed (PS Mobile),PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2012,Team17,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,ZTGD,80,Alien Breed offers fans much more than just a re-release. With an updated version of the game online co-op cross play between the PS3 and Vita and universal level and gun unlocks players can enjoy the game in just about any way they want. If you’ve never played the game before it’s probably not the best use of your money but fans will enjoy the ability to relive their memories while also creating new ones.
My Hero One's Justice 2,PlayStation 4,Mar-13-2020,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameCrate,83,My Hero One’s Justice 2 is an anime arena fighter with really good ideas. It probably won’t see anyone if they aren’t already My Hero Academia fans but anyone who is already in the fanbase will eat it up. And hey if you aren’t a fan but get a chance to play anyway give it a shot it might just surprise you.
Blinx 2: Masters of Time & Space,Xbox,Nov-18-2004,Artoon,Action | Platformer | 3D,Play Magazine,91,This is just masterful game making pure and simple. [Dec 2004 p.66]
Ghostbusters: The Video Game Remastered,Xbox One,Oct-4-2019,Saber Interactive,Action | General,TheXboxHub,80,Ghostbusters: The Video Game Remastered on Xbox One remains as fun and nostalgic as it did in 2009. With punchy combat creepy exploration and a hilarious script that’s beautifully voice acted it’s hard not to recommend this Halloween treat.
Hexyz Force,PSP,May-24-2010,Sting,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,RPG Fan,87,The game was unputdownable for me and I think its a fine addition to any PSP owners library.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,DS,Nov-8-2005,Magic Pockets,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Next Level Gaming,81,It makes really nice use of the DS features both in the story mode and the mini-games and shows you exactly what the system was intended to do.
Yooka-Laylee,PlayStation 4,Apr-11-2017,Playtonic Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Areajugones,90,Yooka-Laylee is the triumphant return of the true platform games. Playtonic has managed to mix everything good of this genre and turn it into something fresh and wonderful.
Suikoden Tactics,PlayStation 2,Nov-8-2005,Konami,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,RPG Fan,90,I wish the game had been a bit longer but there is a new game+ option and I didnt manage to get everything the first time around so there should be some good replay value in it for me.
NBA Playgrounds,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Saber Interactive,Sports | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Video Chums,80,If you dig arcade basketball then NBA Playgrounds is a great addition to the genre. Ballers of all skill levels can find something to love in its enjoyably cartoony take on the sport although your b-ball career may be over well before youd expect it to.
Strike Suit Zero: Director's Cut,PlayStation 4,Apr-8-2014,Born Ready Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Combat,Playstation Official Magazine UK,80,The theatre of destruction around your ship will leave you in awe. [June 2014 p.90]
Space Giraffe,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Llamasoft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Hardcore Gamer,100,Most importantly Space Giraffe is pure addictive fun constantly demanding one more round as the pulsing light melts your eyes out of their sockets. [Oct 2007 p.66]
G-Force,Xbox 360,Jul-21-2009,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | General | Platformer | 3D,ZTGD,80,G-Force was a shock to me. Rarely do I find myself actually wanting to play a game of this type outside of reviewing it but I found myself coming back to it over and over to finish it out.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PGNx Media,85,Thanks to the top-notch production values this is an easy recommendation for fans of the books or movies.
Way of the Passive Fist,Xbox One,Mar-7-2018,Household Games Inc.,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,TheXboxHub,90,The Way of the Passive Fist is a very enjoyable game with the seamless fusion of fighting and rhythm executed brilliantly. As a concept it shouldn’t work but it just does being a lot of fun and a real challenge.
Infinite Crisis,PC,Mar-26-2015,Turbine Inc.,MOBA | Strategy | Real-Time | MOBA,CD-Action,90,It’s the best MOBA since League of Legends pure and simple. [06/2015 p.66]
Lost Planet 2,PlayStation 3,May-11-2010,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Videogameszone.de,89,Great action game including huge boss fights against over-sized monsters. A must have for those who like to play coop games for up to four players. In case you play the game alone alongside AI partners the difficulty level may frustrate you from time to time.
Pure Pinball,Xbox,Aug-5-2004,Iridon Interactive AB,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Pinball,Official Xbox Magazine,76,The triggers control the flippers and the ball physics are outstanding - every hit feels like it has real weight. [Nov 2004 p.77]
QuickSpot,DS,Mar-19-2007,Namco,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Game Chronicles,78,QuickSpot was a fantastic surprise. I hadn’t even heard of the game until the day it showed up for review and it only took me ten minutes before I was hopefully hooked.
Deadly Premonition,Xbox 360,Feb-17-2010,Access Games,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Open-World,Destructoid,100,There is absolutely nothing in this industry that can compare to how weird and wonderful the whole experience is. Judged as a piece of entertainment as a game that consistently surprises and amazes and leaves jaws hanging I have no choice but to say that Deadly Premonition goes above and beyond. This game is so bad its not just become good. Its pretty close to perfect.
AiRace Speed,3DS,Sep-19-2013,QubicGames,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,Gaming Nexus,80,AiRace Speed may not seem like much but for $4.99 the difficulty curve ensures you’re not just breezing through the game. Some of the turns seem incredibly sharp and will put your maneuvering skills to the test but overall AiRace Speed is a fairly fun game. Just keep the 3D turned off.
World Racing 2,PC,Aug-14-2006,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Gamer's Hell,86,Despite the minor aesthetic flaws World Racing 2 is a success in terms of improvement over its predecessor. The lack of an in-car view with full cockpit might leave some hardcore fans slightly disappointed but the other features of the game more than make up for that loss.
Rag Doll Kung Fu: Fists of Plastic,PlayStation 3,Apr-9-2009,Tarsier Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Fighting | Fighting | Party / Minigame | 2D | 2D,D+PAD Magazine,90,It’s engaging unique humorous and hugely polished and earns its place as one of the top original titles on PSN with ease.
WARTILE,PC,Feb-8-2018,Playwood Project,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,The Games Machine,83,Despite some camera issues and a low longevity Wartile is an enjoyable game and a perfect mix between two worlds: RTS and board games. Even if you love just one of them you should give it a chance.
The Wizards: Enhanced Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-12-2019,Carbon Studio,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Hobby Consolas,84,The Wizards delivers one of the most solid experience we enjoyed in VR. It is immersive comfortable and makes perfect use of motion controls to make us feel like summoning spells and confronting huge creatures.
MotoGP 10/11,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Monumental Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,GamerNode,80,MotoGP 10/11 has a few problems such as touchy controls and a lack of multiplayer options but the challenging races and deep career mode will leave motorcycle racing fans happy.
The Ball,PC,Oct-26-2010,Teotl Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer Limit,85,For $20 The Ball is a perfect way to kill time until Portal 2.
The UnderGarden,Xbox 360,Nov-10-2010,Vitamin G Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Gamers' Temple,92,The UnderGardens unique elements come together to make for an enjoyable and relaxing game experience.
Evil Dead: Regeneration,PlayStation 2,Sep-13-2005,Cranky Pants Games,Action Adventure | Horror,GamingTrend,91,Fast furious funny and a breeze to play through so it’s perfect for the weekend gamer.
The Punisher,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2005,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Maxim Online,100,Its not all brutality. The Punisher is also one of the most immersive strategy games ever created. Aim for the head and enjoy.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Jedi Alliance,DS,Nov-11-2008,LucasArts,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,80,I have seldom awarded a game a higher overall score than it earned in the gameplay category but Jedi Alliance is one rare example whose production values actually counterbalance some of the gameplay shortcomings.
Curious Expedition,Switch,Apr-2-2020,Maschinen-Mensch,Adventure | General,Nintendojo,83,Despite its flaws though Curious Expedition is a fun adventure and a well-crafted experience. With deep gameplay mechanics lots of characters to choose from and a high replayability factor this is worth a look if you like exploration adventures.
Sword of the Stars,PC,Aug-17-2006,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,PC Gamer,89,While Sword of the Stars doesnt possess the battlefield variety of the Homeworld games that inspired it it remains an ambitious and engrossing strategy triumph. [Nov. 2006 p.78]
Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Jaleco Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,GameZone,88,Hands down this is by far the best console RTS that I have played to date and it really helps console owners who haven’t played PC RTS titles to see what all the fun is about.
Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup,PlayStation 2,Oct-28-2003,Magic Pockets,Sports | Alternative | Other,Worth Playing,84,Definitely personifies the magnificence of the sport but it is lacking because its not as advanced as I had hoped it would be.
ATV Quad Power Racing 2,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2003,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,TotalGames.net,81,It’s not going to rock your world but it looks good sounds good plays great and is sure to put a big old smile on your face.
Ultimate Fighting Championship: Throwdown,PlayStation 2,Jun-3-2002,Opus,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpy,86,Fighting game fans will like Throwdown. Mixed martial arts fans will love it.
Freakyforms: Your Creations Alive!,3DS,Nov-10-2011,Asobism | Co. ltd.,Miscellaneous | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,89,The greatest character and planet creation kit ever. If the exploration had been better this would be gold but then youd probably be paying £30 for it.
Gauntlet (2014),PC,Sep-23-2014,Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,GamingTrend,90,Few games can come close to creating the same mayhem and excitement as Gauntlet can.
Typoman: Revised,Switch,Feb-22-2018,Brainseed Factory,Action | Platformer | 2D,The Games Machine,80,Typoman Revised is a brainy and well-designed platformer offering few hours of clever fun and some degree of replayability. The Switch version is by far the better one more polished and with some new ingredients that will please the players. Unfortunately the touch screen is noo longer supported (but it was on the Wii U version).
Men of War: Assault Squad 2,PC,Mar-20-2014,1C | 1C Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,Pelit (Finland),89,Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is just about the best multiplayer experience the World War II games have to offer. [June 2014]
Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate,3DS,Oct-25-2013,Armature Studio,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,77,Lumpy in places thumpy in others this is generally good fun. [Dec 2013 p.86]
Fallout: New Vegas - Dead Money,PlayStation 3,Feb-22-2011,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,Thunderbolt,80,Though the new gear is lackluster the path opened to the level 35 cap and new perks is fair compensation.
Switchball,PlayStation 3,Sep-18-2009,Atomic Elbow,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,D+PAD Magazine,80,It is in many ways a very meek and understated game…but under its mild-mannered exterior lies an engaging diverting and enjoyable title that for the price offers a heap of entertainment.
Tom Clancy's HAWX 2,Xbox 360,Sep-7-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,XGN,85,If youre on the lookout for a great flight game look no further. H.A.W.X. 2 is the best game of its kind and will keep you wannabe pilots busy for weeks to come.
Viking: Battle for Asgard,Xbox 360,Mar-25-2008,Creative Assembly,Action | Action Adventure | General | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Play Magazine,95,Easy to manage hot keys intuitive controls a great map that doubles as an objective outline...everything here is spot on. [Apr 2008 p.55]
Kingdom Come: Deliverance,Xbox One,Feb-13-2018,Warhorse Studios,Historic | Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Action RPG,Xbox Tavern,100,Warhorse have developed a game that’s not only massively in-depth but equally as intriguing and captivating. Their care and attention to detail pulls through in each and every sequence within. This level of realism isn’t going to be for everyone but for those that want the authentic experience Deliverance delivers and then some. It’s engaging it’s deep and it’s thoroughly entertaining.
Space Hulk: Tactics,PlayStation 4,Oct-9-2018,Cyanide | Cyanide Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Digitally Downloaded,80,Space Hulk: Tactics is the most impressive Warhammer 40K effort Ive played in recent memory.
Warhammer 40000: Armageddon,PC,Nov-26-2014,The Lordz Games Studio | Flashback Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | General,Digitally Downloaded,80,Is it disappointing that units in Warhammer 40000 are so simple in presentation? Sure especially when you consider how monotone many of the apocalyptic environments are. But given the choice between a game like this an a major studio producing a Warhammer game that fails to even understand where the real appeal of Warhammer lies Ill take a game like Warhammer 40000: Armageddon any time.
Galcon Fusion,PC,Feb-11-2010,Phil Hassey,Strategy | General | General,PC Format,90,Looks rather simple but is in fact very deep. [Apr 2010 p.101]
FIFA 18,Switch,Sep-29-2017,EA Vancouver,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Everyeye.it,84,Shines in the portable setting.
Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia,DS,Nov-10-2008,HAL Labs | Creatures Inc.,Role-Playing | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,84,A handful of niggles but not enough to stop this from being more accessible and enjoyable than its predecessor.
Dear Esther: Landmark Edition,Xbox One,Sep-20-2016,The Chinese Room,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Brash Games,90,Dear Esther: Landmark Edition is an experience that has held my imagination for days after finishing it. It is beautiful yet haunting sad yet inspiring. It may be short but it is perfectly paced and you owe it to yourself to experience this game it will leave you breathless.
Batman: The Telltale Series,PlayStation 4,Sep-13-2016,Telltale Games,Action | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,GameCritics,85,Batman: The Telltale Series started strong and ended the same way and with many characters’ fates left undecided and new characters appearing in the final act a second season seems inevitable — I look forward to it.
Star Wars Pinball,3DS,Sep-19-2013,Zen Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Pinball | Pinball,DarkStation,80,Despite some technical hiccups I actually think handheld is a better version of the game than a console experience and if you have the system for it definitely get this one on the go.
The Legend of Heroes: A Tear of Vermillion,PSP,Nov-15-2005,Microvision,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | General | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GameSpy,80,A highly entertaining RPG that no PSP-owning fan of the genre should pass up. Your socks wont be blown off but your role-playing desires will be satiated. Isnt that more important?
Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta,PC,Aug-3-2009,Bethesda Softworks,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,Game Revolution,83,A great way to end the downloadable content run for Fallout 3. If its indeed the final DLC were to see for the game its surely an out-of-this-world way to close off our explorations of the Capital Wasteland providing a thoroughly enjoyable ride that is likely to last almost as much as the longest of the packs thats come out so far - Broken Steel.
GORN,PlayStation 4,May-19-2020,Free Lives,Action | General,PlayStation Universe,85,GORN is a bloody good time arriving right at the moment when we need it most. Some strategy is hidden beneath all of the gore and carnage though you might find yourself just dipping into GORN to bash some heads for a few minutes. While there are some technical limitations brought on by the PlayStation Camera GORN works pretty well on the PSVR. As both a workout and a psychological enema GORN succeeds wildly.
NASCAR 07,PlayStation 2,Sep-6-2006,EA Tiburon,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,Next Level Gaming,85,Minus the graphics NASCAR 07 is just as solid as its predecessors. The skill points are nice as are the driver attributes. And a new story mode is always good.
Wii Sports Club,Wii U,Nov-7-2013,Nintendo,Sports | General | General,Nintendojo,83,With only two sports currently available Wii Sports Club isn’t as robust an experience as it could be but what is there will still keep players entertained for hours. With the promise of additional sports in the future there’s a lot of potential for Wii Sports Club and it’s easily worth a download for anyone who owns a Wii U.
Lost in Shadow,Wii,Jan-4-2011,Hudson Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,Multiplayer.it,85,A Shadows Tale is an engaging and enjoyable platform game with a nice artistic direction and a good number of original elements that fit effectively into the gameplay.
Bone: Out From Boneville,PC,Sep-15-2005,Telltale Games,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person,Just Adventure,100,I personally have nothing but good things to say about this game. In fact the only problem I have is that it’s too short and that just means I’m greedy. I think anyone who wants to be whisked away into a brightly colored land of adventure featuring the time-honored themes of good and evil friends and foes and a good dose of real humor will be doing themselves a serious favor by checking out this game.
Hatoful Boyfriend,PC,Feb-15-2012,Hato Moa,General | Adventure | General | Visual Novel,Multiplayer.it,85,Do you ever dream about a love story with a dove? Do you ever feel that your life will be better with a bird on your side? If the answers are yes try Hatoful Boyfriend.
Binary Domain,PC,Apr-27-2012,Devils Details,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,LEVEL (Czech Republic),80,If you can get over the weak beginning the game will catch you – Binary Domain is a breathtaking shooter set in a Hollywood style. A must-have for all fans of robots-went-angry situation. [June 2012]
Test Drive Unlimited 2,Xbox 360,Feb-8-2011,Eden Studios | Eden,Driving | Racing | Simulation | General | General | Automobile,MondoXbox,88,A very enjoyable game despite some blind spots in the graphics and sound areas: the social aspects and the many many things to do in Ibiza and Oahu will keep your interest high for a long time.
Pathway,PC,Apr-11-2019,Robotality,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Strategy Gamer,100,I can’t find many faults with Pathway beyond the occasional bit of bad luck with the map generation that puts camps and traders too far off-track to be worth going to or throws a particularly tough combat at you straight away. Apart from that small issue this game is frankly amazing and it kept me up until dawn trying to find out what the Wrath of God was and I am so distraught that I died just before the finale. Let’s just say I chose… poorly.
Juiced,Xbox,Jun-13-2005,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,GameBiz,85,A pretty good street racing game.
Mario Party: Star Rush,3DS,Nov-4-2016,Nintendo | Nd Cube,Miscellaneous | Party / Minigame,NF Magazine,85,Mario Party: Star Rush is far and away the most fun Ive ever had with a Mario Party game. [Issue #24 – November/December 2016 p.17M]
Major League Baseball 2K12,Xbox 360,Mar-6-2012,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Game Chronicles,85,And thats precisely the group that 2K Sports is trying to target with MLB 2K12 – the hardcore baseball fans. With the slow tactical pitching game the new fielding mechanics and the complex base running – MLB 2K12 is definitely not for the casual gamer. And hardcore fans should really find something to like in MLB 2K12 because it is as accurate a hardball experience as can be found in gaming.
Wii Party,Wii,Oct-3-2010,Nd Cube,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Play.tm,89,But what it does have it wears on its sleeve - hundreds of hand crafted miniature challenges - and thats what I keep coming back for.
Tokyo Crash Mobs,3DS,Jan-17-2013,Mitchell,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Destructoid,85,A game that I truly did not see coming. Fans of surreal FMV and/or match three puzzle games should check it out.
Buzz! Master Quiz,PSP,Sep-23-2008,Relentless Software,Miscellaneous | Trivia / Game Show | Trivia / Game Show,Cheat Code Central,82,Its fun to pick up and play whenever you have a moment but with the lowered production values you might have just as much fun with a mobile trivia game.
Costume Quest 2,PC,Oct-7-2014,Double Fine Productions,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Japanese-Style,Digital Trends,80,Costume Quest 2 is a classic JRPG stripped of all the tedious baggage and wrapped in Double Fine’s impeccable writing and sense of whimsy.
Juiced 2: Hot Import Nights,Xbox 360,Sep-17-2007,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,NZGamer,85,Better than the sum of its parts the game offers an arcade experience with a little more room to muck around and a little more scope for customising things than is usually offered.
Grand Theft Auto,Game Boy Advance,Oct-26-2004,Digital Eclipse,Action Adventure | Modern,Next Level Gaming,90,The game that we have been waiting for. It is the best GTA game on a portable system and it made a smooth transition from console to portable.
Snack World: The Dungeon Crawl Gold,Switch,Feb-14-2020,Level 5,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Japanese-Style,Hardcore Gamer,90,There’s just so much that Snack World does right for a dungeon crawler that even without having any sort of serious story it manages to be one of the best in the genre with the sheer fun variety it offers. Anyone looking for a brand new adventuring title should give Snack World: The Dungeon Crawl – Gold their time as it’s surprisingly fantastic.
Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy,Switch,Mar-26-2020,Aspyr,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,NF Magazine,80,This is where the fun begins. [Issue #46 – May/June 2020 p. 27]
American Fugitive,Xbox One,May-24-2019,Fallen Tree Games,Action Adventure | Sandbox | Open-World,Xbox Tavern,80,Whilst I take issue with the game’s pacing and its hit and miss AI there’s little else to scoff at here. American Fugitive is a love letter to fans of classic Grand Theft Auto. The game’s stunning world is full of varied activities and events with no shortage of choice to take to throughout each and every aspect within. This is all held together by remarkably fluid gameplay putting forward a sandbox that’s deep robust and constantly action-packed.
NASCAR Heat 3,Xbox One,Sep-7-2018,704Games,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,XboxAddict,75,With a couple small personal preference issues I still believe that NASCAR Heat 3 is a fairly solid game. Is it perfect? No game is. With the sheer amount of content modes and overall experience while in gameplay I would have no issue recommending this game to someone if youre a fan of the sport. If you want a fun racing game that you can just sit back relax drink a beer or two and race this is the game for you. 3... 2... 1... Race!
The Council - Episode 3: Ripples,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,GameCritics,85,The Council once again manages to make player actions feel vital in a way that few narrative choice titles accomplish – in fact there are some diverging plot points that are so significant I have a difficult time imagining how many versions of conversations will have to be crafted for the last two episodes. This is also an episodic series where major characters can die and that adds a level of danger to every interaction that few in its genre can match. Episode four can’t arrive quickly enough!
The 25th Ward: The Silver Case,PlayStation 4,Mar-13-2018,Grasshopper Manufacture,Adventure | Visual Novel,Digitally Downloaded,90,To say that The 25th Ward is niche would be an understatement but that’s what’s so impressive about it. It respects the intelligence of its players allowing them to wade through the feverish surrealism that the game often depicts and melds that perfectly with a traditional noir thriller than Raymond Chandler himself would have been proud of. Goichi Suda might be known for his action games today (and they’re usually very fine games in their own right) but what I wouldn’t give for him to go back for another spin or two at the visual novel.
One Piece: Unlimited World Red - Deluxe Edition,Switch,Sep-29-2017,Ganbarion,Action | General,God is a Geek,80,One Piece: Unlimited World Red Deluxe Edition on Switch is the best way to experience Unlimited World Red and exactly how a licensed game should be.
LEVEL 22 Gary's Misadventures,Xbox One,Jan-29-2016,Moving Player | Noego,Action | General,We Got This Covered,80,Level 22: Garys Misadventures is a delightful twist on a genre that can take itself way too seriously at times. It manages to make fun of how ridiculous stealth games can be and provides a solid challenge itself even if it doesnt last that long.
Kromaia Omega,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2015,Kraken Empire,Action | Shooter | Rail,PSNStores,90,In all Kromaia Ω is a diamond in the current outpouring of PSN titles that shouldn’t be overlooked based on its price tag. There are a couple of other game modes included in this new package but the main campaign will take around eight enjoyable hours to complete. I didn’t even mention the unlockable grapple hook a feature that opens up new levels of piloting expertise.
Five Nights at Freddy's 3,PC,Mar-2-2015,Scott Cawthon,Action | General,PC Gamer,77,The excellently revised camera system and eerie villain makes Five Nights at Freddy’s 3 one of the better scare-fests out there.
Assassin's Creed Unity: Dead Kings,PlayStation 4,Jan-13-2015,Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Historic | Open-World,IGN Italia,90,Its got a couple of badly designed puzzles but its a meaty DLC and it comes for free!
Neverending Nightmares,PC,Sep-26-2014,Infinitap Games,Horror | Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,Game Revolution,90,While I do believe some players may dismiss the game as a walking simulator (as they are wont to do nowadays) Neverending Nightmares falls into the must-play section of the horror genre. Whether or not you find it scary you’ll definitely be disturbed and intrigued as you seek resolution to the madness.
Major League Baseball 2K12,PlayStation 3,Mar-6-2012,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),80,While 2K12 plays a solid game and displays improvements over the past version it doesnt add enough to achieve its lofty aspirations. [Apr 2012 p.85]
Bejeweled Blitz Live,Xbox 360,Feb-23-2011,Torpex Games LLC,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Matching,Planet Xbox 360,87,If youre a dedicated Bejeweled player or youre looking for a great party game to tackle with your friends Bejeweled Blitz Live is a smart choice. Its only 800 Microsoft points ($10) and well worth every penny as you gain new skills and bump up your score into the stratosphere.
Tenchu: Shadow Assassins,PSP,Mar-24-2009,From Software | Acquire,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Vandal,85,The new Tenchu installment will surprise positively series followers apart from genre fans. It is a slow game in which well have to think twice each of our steps in order to survive. It has great hours of action and fun and also offers a story worth being followed up to the end.
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Sep-16-2008,Krome Studios,Action | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),80,If you havent upgraded to a PS3 the action story and exclusive levels here wont disappoint. [Oct 2008 p.76]
Brain Challenge,DS,Jan-8-2008,Ubisoft,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Extreme Gamer,78,Brain Challenge is a fun adventurous take on the brain game genre. The amount of mini-games keep the stress and brain training fun and exciting even on daily plays
My Word Coach,Wii,Nov-6-2007,Ubisoft,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,GamingTrend,81,I was taken aback by the difficulty of the intro. The tutorial word in the fill-in-the-blank game is Villain. That was something a little over the top for my 7 year old.
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,DS,Oct-17-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameZone,73,Its a fun game that takes advantage of the DS touch screen without being gimmicky. Hats off to the developers for keeping the spirit of Spyro alive and well.

A huge bonus.

Army Men: RTS,PlayStation 2,Mar-27-2002,Pandemic Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,GameZone,85,The real joy of Army Men RTS is the creativity of the game. The cut scenes are downright hilarious and the movie spoofs are frequent.
Ultimate Ride,PC,Sep-30-2001,Gigawatt Studios,Action | Strategy | General | Management | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,84,Its as realistic as a virtual coaster could possibly be and once its over you cant wait to get back in line to ride it again.

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,PlayStation 3,Sep-25-2012,Arkedo Studio,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Game Informer,85,Hell Yeah is an enjoyable 2D sidescroller that waxes nostalgic about classic games just as much as it establishes its own identity as a how-to guide to murdering monsters in ridiculous ways.

Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny,PlayStation 2,Apr-25-2006,Gust,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,netjak,89,Its the kind of game that made me feel disappointed it was over. If all games that were just polished versions of older games like Atelier Iris 2 is then Id never want for an original game again.

Treasure World,DS,Jun-30-2009,Aspyr,Simulation | General | General,Nintendojo,84,By utilizing tech that is now much older than the five years that DS has been around Aspyr managed to create a unique experience something it should be commended for.
Zendoku,DS,Jun-26-2007,Zoonami Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Logic | Logic,Digital Entertainment News,85,This is an addiction not a game. As hard as you may fall for it there are rewards for sticking with it but the later levels will make it harder to do so.

TSIOQUE,PC,Nov-7-2018,OhNoo,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Digital Chumps,90,Overall the gameplay of TSIOQUE is a layer of entertaining complication. It offers up a little bit of new and a little bit of old and sprinkles it with a helluva protagonist that is fun to play. It doesn’t necessarily redefine the point and click genre but it shows that there is more to it than you might remember. The gameplay is simply a methodically well put together masterpiece that will certainly make you wish for those LucasArts days when they ruled the roost in this genre.

Pure Pool,Xbox One,Nov-14-2014,VooFoo Studios,Alternative | Other | Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards,MondoXbox,85,A very good pool simulation with great ball and shot physics. It could have used some more play modes but it remains a recommended game at a very good price.

The only real negative is its short runtime which leaves you wishing the developers had waited to release the entire game at once.
Effie,PlayStation 4,Jun-4-2019,Factoria Cultural Gestio | S.L.,Action | Platformer | 3D,Hobby Consolas,80,Effie is without any doubt one of the best games that has come out of the PlayStation Talents initiative.

Its this feeling that sets EA Sports Active 2 apart from the rest of the exercise games on the market and its why if youre serious about getting into shape (and you can deal with the hefty price tag) you should definitely try EA Sports Active 2.

Light Tracer,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Oasis Games,Puzzle | Action,VRFocus,80,Overall Light Tracer is a well-crafted VR platform title. Once you get used to the controls it becomes challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. There are some very frustrating elements but not enough to spoil the gameplay entirely. Having said that Light Tracer is at its best when played in relatively small doses. Like a plate of snacks to nibble on instead of a feast but still just as tasty.

iO,PlayStation 4,Feb-14-2017,Gamious,Puzzle | Action,PSNStores,80,iO works great in situations where you might only have a few minutes to work through a level or two. It’s fun to jump in solve a course and move on to the next. The focus on momentum makes this feel pretty unique and the game’s 225 courses get a good deal of mileage out of the grow/shrink mechanic. Considering this is a game that I only heard about a week ago this turned out to be a pleasant little surprise.
Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis,Wii,Oct-16-2007,Rockstar San Diego,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Other | Tennis,Worth Playing,90,Ultimately its a good version of a good game that originated on a very different platform — an even better game really just as Resident Evil 4 for Wii is the definitive version of an already excellent title.

DanceStar Party Hits,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2012,SCEE,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Pelit (Finland),84,Sonys debut in the dancing game franchise is quite good. This easy-going dance experience works quite nicely with Move although theres no match for the precision what Kinect gives. This game proves the fact that dancing is fun. Instead of making the right moves the focus is on the experience. [Dec 2011]
Samba de Amigo,Wii,Sep-23-2008,Gearbox Software,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Nintendo Power,90,Of course the big question on the minds of Samba devotees is how the controls stack up to the Dreamcast version and its beloved maracas peripheral.

Rango,Xbox 360,Mar-1-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Game Chronicles,92,Rango is one of those rare movie games that is actually good. Actually its fantastic! It also doesnt require you to have seen the film or know anything about these characters.

The Long Journey Home,PC,May-30-2017,Daedalic Studio West,Action Adventure | General,Impulsegamer,88,Each play through is going to be different and it’s simple enough that it makes for a good pick up and play title. It also has one of the nicest notes I’ve seen on a game recently when you go to quite it tells you your game will be saved… to often these days (especially with console ports etc) you can’t be too sure if you’re at a point that will be saved or if when you return you will find yourself some way back in your journey… so it’s a small but nice element.

Deadlight,Xbox 360,Aug-1-2012,Tequila Works,Action | General | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,XboxAddict,90,The quality of content is amazing and when you combine the psychotic storyline with the fluid gameplay and top it off with amazing use of the Unreal engine for graphics and a soundtrack that will drive suspense deep into your soul Deadlight is easily one of the best Xbox Live Arcade games to come out this summer or arguably this year.

Zwei: The Arges Adventure,PC,Jan-24-2018,Falcom,Action RPG | Role-Playing | General,GameSpew,80,While there’s a lot to love within The Arges Adventure it’s mostly superficial due to a frustrating combat system that forces most of the game to become a slog.

Red Wings: Aces of the Sky,Switch,May-21-2020,All in! Games,Simulation | Flight | Combat,NintendoWorldReport,80,Red Wings: Aces of the Sky is a surprisingly addictive game. It is a prime example of a very simple gameplay loop executed extremely well. It is a focused experience and I think that is for the best. While I did run into some mild colorblind accessibility issues they didn’t slow down my enjoyment too much. Arguably where it stumbles most is in trying to force in diversity via the bombing missions. When Red Wings accepts its own simplicity it is brilliant. The local co-op makes for a wonderful and unexpected addition and strong art design helps to maintain its charm for many hours. Red Wings: Aces of the Sky is no doubt destined to become a hidden gem of the Switch eShop.
Dry Drowning,PC,Aug-2-2019,Studio V,Adventure | Visual Novel,SpazioGames,85,Dry Drowning is a very good game with great narrative experience.

Mass Effect 2: Arrival,PlayStation 3,Mar-29-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Destructoid,85,Dont get me wrong Arrival sits comfortably between Overlord and Lair of the Shadow Broker in terms of quality and I still want to play Mass Effect 3 badly but I dont want play it that much more badly after having played Arrival.

Strong personality in the combat mechanics but aged and turned slightly simplistic. Great character design with good HD fine tuning. The price sadly is a total turnoff.
Oninaki,Switch,Aug-22-2019,Tokyo RPG Factory,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Japanese-Style,Nintendo Enthusiast,90,On the surface Oninaki might seem like a rough-around-the-edges action RPG lacking depth to its combat alongside an anime-inspired melodramatic story. However for those who are patient enough to explore its world characters and ability-based battle system there’s a lot to like an dive into after all. If you have even the slightest curiosity in this title Oninaki‘s refreshing take on JRPGs is most definitely worth your time.

Ultimately it’s a great example of what can be done in VR and a well polished game. Touted as a multiplayer game it’s no slouch as a single player game and is certainly worth a play through.

Outlast 2,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2017,Red Barrels,Action Adventure | Survival,GameGrin,90,Outlast 2 could well be the scariest horror game I have played to date. There were a few very minor gripes but the isolation desolation and desperation were noticeable throughout. The sense of fear was more impactful than in the first game and there were parts where I played hiding behind anything I could get my hands on. I went to Temple Gate and I did not enjoy my stay. And by that statement alone I have to applaud Red Barrels for creating such a brilliant game.

Sudden Strike II,PC,Sep-26-2002,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,ActionTrip,84,Instead of investing time and energy into making demanding 3D graphics the crew at FireGlow has concentrated on improving the gameplay by increasing the number of missions units and tactical possibilities.
Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO,GameCube,Sep-23-2002,Capcom,Action | Fighting | 2D,Gamer's Pulse,94,The extra additions of the grooves and super combos was also a stroke of genius and now that I look at this tiny little disc I have to ask myself How did they fit it all in there?
WWF Raw,Xbox,Feb-11-2002,Anchor,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Electric Playground,95,It is just the Total Package (yeah I know I am embarrassed of myself for that one) combining great gameplay with fantastic visuals to create one of the finest sports game ever.

Rad,Switch,Aug-20-2019,Double Fine Productions,Adventure | Action Adventure | General,GameSpace,85,RAD is a nice throwback to the eighties alongside being a decent roguelite. It wont be a roguelike you put over a hundred hours into but it will give you enough value for its $19.99 price point. Double Fine hit the mark on making RAD stand out despite having shortcomings around combat and performance issues when too much is going on.
My Hero One's Justice,PlayStation 4,Oct-26-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General | Fighting | 3D,COGconnected,83,This is going to make me sound insane but I never saw these titles as fighting games until now. They were just flashy vehicles for whatever Shonen Jump series Bandai Namco had gotten the rights to. And yet underneath all that is a complex yet accessible game that rewards exploration experimentation and practice. A proper fighting game in other words. If you’re looking for another 3D fighter give this one a shot. If you’re a My Hero Academia fan however you absolutely can’t miss My Hero One’s Justice. This could be the start of something beautiful after all.
Just Cause 4,PC,Dec-4-2018,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Windows Central,100,Everything is absolutely fantastic and while in-game performance isnt perfect its hardly enough of a downside to affect my view of the game overall. Avalanche has truly brought the thunder.

Men of War: Vietnam,PC,Sep-8-2011,Best Way,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military | Tactics,Game Chronicles,86,I enjoyed Men of War: Vietnam a lot more than I initially thought I would.

The Blind Prophet,PC,Feb-5-2020,ARS GOETIA,Adventure | General,CD-Action,85,Despite its dark theme the game gets more fun by the minute and the ‘Hellboy’ and ‘Sin City’ inspired graphics are as pleasant to look at as the soundtrack is to listen to. [04/2020 p.72]
Smoke and Sacrifice,PC,May-31-2018,Solar Sail Games,Action Adventure | General,games(TM),80,While its story doesnt quite have the emotional heft it could have had with more character development it nonetheless gives players a drive and a reason to persist through a harsh world. [July 2018 p.73]

Tennis in the Face,PlayStation 4,Dec-9-2014,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Action | General,Gaming Age,83,Tennis in the Face may not push the PS4 to its limits (I doubt the eventual Vita version will even do that either) but its still a lot more enjoyable than any number of other more complex games — and quite frankly Ill take enjoyable over complex any day of the week.
Azkend 2: The World Beneath,Switch,Jan-12-2018,10tons,Puzzle | Matching,GameGrin,75,Azkend 2 has a threadbare story that basically gives context for going from one puzzle to the next and it definitely won’t be the reason anyone picks this game up. The events are narrated by the female protagonist whose voice was more akin to that of a children’s TV presenter. The wonderful artwork fuses well with the game’s musical score both of which set a suitably mysterious and adventurous tone.
Slain: Back from Hell,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,God is a Geek,80,Slain: Back from Hell is a more metal and modern Castlevania that looks and plays great but is held back by a few sections which feel unfairly difficulty.
WRC: FIA World Rally Championship,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2010,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,80,Its a superb rally game capturing the spirit and the thrills. Recommended. [November 2010 p74]

Gungrave: Overdose,PlayStation 2,Sep-15-2004,Seta Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Gamezilla!,91,Has it where it counts however as it offers a really good looking version of the anime characters.

Potata: Fairy Flower,Switch,Jun-6-2020,OverGamez,Action | Platformer | 2D,Pure Nintendo,80,While it may not be critically riveting Potato: Fairy Flower is a game that is simply meant to be played and enjoyed. There is some storytelling some sense of adventure some pattern learning and an adversary to overcome. There are also some areas where it could use some polishing but taken for what it is this is a fun game.
The Complex,Xbox One,Mar-31-2020,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Adventure | General,God is a Geek,95,The story and acting are superb and with so many endings it’s almost impossible to predict how each decision will play out and affect the overall conclusion. A must play for fans of live-action games.

Vanishing Point,PlayStation,Feb-5-2001,Clockwork Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Sports Gaming Network,90,I have yet to notice any pop-up or draw-in in the game. The developers did a tremendous job of hiding these artifacts behind tunnels and turns such that once you make a curve or pop over a hill the images flow naturally.
Senran Kagura: Estival Versus,PlayStation 4,Mar-15-2016,Tamsoft | Marvelous Inc.,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,Senran Kagura: Estival Versus is great fun combining the rawest of Japanese-style raunch humour with a tight and mechanically sound combat system.

Giga Wrecker Alt.,PlayStation 4,Apr-12-2019,Game Freak,Action | Platformer | 2D,PlayStation Universe,85,Giga Wrecker Alt marries puzzling with Metroidvania beautifully offering up just enough challenge without getting in its own way. Despite its few stumbles Giga Wrecker Alt is one of those out-of-nowhere games thats well worth your time.
Record of Agarest War,PlayStation 3,Apr-27-2010,Compile Heart,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,Gaming Age,75,I think Record of Agarest War is definitely a pretty niche SRPG thats not going to appeal to players that arent already familiar with this particular game type. However I dont think its meant to bring in new players and as far as fan service games go this is pretty tame and playable by teens on up.
Knights of Pen & Paper 2,PC,Oct-20-2015,Kyy Games,Role-Playing | General,Gaming Nexus,85,While it might not be the most complex role-playing game available its a worthwhile and entertaining purchase for players eager to set out on a casual fantasy adventure.
We Ski,Wii,May-13-2008,Bandai Namco Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,1UP,100,We Ski offers an absurd amount of events objectives and extras -- and its all icing on the mountain as this would be a great game without most of it. The comfortable motion controls ensure that even a simple leisurely ski around the resort is usually a joy.

Beatmania,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Konami,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,GamePro,90,Being the mother of rhythm games Beatmania has been around before Dance Dance Revolution ever got popular. It took a long time but its finally here and rhythm game fans everywhere should be rejoicing.
One Piece Grand Battle,GameCube,Sep-7-2005,Ganbarion,Action | Fighting | 3D,AceGamez,100,A title perfect for gamers of any age.

Darius Cozmic Collection: Console,PlayStation 4,Jun-16-2020,M2,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Impulsegamer,72,Overall if you are a fan of retro gaming especially if you were a fan of Darius then this may well be just the right fix you have been looking for. In terms of buying the collection… that may be a bit trickier as you can choose either Arcade or Console… not both… well you can choose both but you will be buying two separate collections rather than one. So I would suggest if you had a preference or if you have experience I should say with one over the other… go with what you know. Or if you are feeling like throwing money around then by all means get both. A worth while trip down memory lane!
Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment,PlayStation Vita,Aug-19-2014,Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Gaming Nexus,88,Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment transcends its license to become a truly engrossing portable role-playing game. Unfortunately this lengthy adventure is far from perfect with problems ranging from bad translation to simplistic missions. But none of that gets in the way of one of the most ambitious anime games ever constructed.
Star Fox: Assault,GameCube,Feb-14-2005,Namco,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Thunderbolt,90,While certainly not perfect – the game is short and could have benefited greatly from LAN or online multiplayer support – there really isnt a more versatile arcade-style shooter for the GameCube system.
Shoot Many Robots,Xbox 360,Mar-14-2012,Demiurge Studios,Action | General | General,ZTGD,94,Of course if you do find a level to be too challenging you can always jump online with some fellow rednecks and have a blast cooperatively.

[Mar 2008 p.86]
JYDGE,Switch,Oct-19-2017,10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Vooks,100,I love the look of Jydge. It’s like The Sims and Blade Runner got together one night and decided it would be a good idea to combine their aesthetics into a joint venture of top-down/isometric and bleak futuristic stylings and then spiced it up with pops of neon. The soundtrack is pretty good too. You could say it’s like a box of chocolates; you never know what you are going to get until that one track kicks in that is as annoying as coming across a chocolate with a concealed almond inside. Not to worry there are plenty of chocolates in the box and they are random any time you enter a stage. The music tracks that is not the chocolates.
Silent Hill 4: The Room,PC,Sep-7-2004,Konami,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Stuff,85,The large number of cut scenes seems a little distracting at first but once you get used to them they add a lot of depth to the game.
UFO: Aftermath,PC,Oct-15-2003,Altar Interactive,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GameZone,85,An interesting mix of RTS turn-based and straight strategic gameplay and varied mission designs. However the turn-based/RTS system may seem a bit convoluted for some gamers who expect a more simplistic action-oriented approach to squad-based strategy.
K-1 World Grand Prix,PlayStation 2,Jul-9-2003,Konami,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Cheat Code Central,90,Its not a button masher. Energy and strength must be conserved. The key to good gameplay is looking for and finding openings. Taking advantage of your opponents weakness is the strategy that will separate the men from the boys.
Incoming Forces,PC,Sep-25-2002,Rage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,ActionTrip,84,The gameplay is intense and the visuals are impressive which means that all the shooter basics are in place.

Blood Omen 2,PlayStation 2,Mar-21-2002,Crystal Dynamics,Action Adventure | Horror,GamePro,80,Kain’s modus operandi of grim human slaughter is so distressingly delightful.
MotoGP,Game Boy Advance,Mar-8-2002,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Street,Cinescape,83,Probably the best racing game on the Game Boy Advance. It has great graphics good control and is a lot of fun to play. The password system is the only real problem I’ve found.
Iron Aces,Dreamcast,Feb-6-2001,Marionette,Simulation | Flight | WWII,Playboy,85,Basic gameplay mechanics combine with real-world charisma to form the most solid Dreamcast flight simulator seen to date.
Shattered Union,PC,Oct-17-2005,PopTop Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | General | Historic,Gamezilla!,90,So overall its a buy except possibly for those who might find the apparent wishful-thinking anti-Americanism of the setting disturbing (It depicts Washington DC as a post-nuke grease spot with a ruin of the Washington Monument in the middle.)
MediEvil,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2019,Other Ocean Interactive | Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action Adventure | General,App Trigger,100,MediEvil is a colorful trip down memory lane filled with gorgeous updated graphics the same amazing OST and improved (yet still retro) gameplay mechanics. This will make you feel like a kid again.
Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Her Interactive,Adventure | First-Person | General | Point-and-Click | Modern,IGN,75,Another engaging Nancy Drew mystery full of colorful characters.

Pony Friends,DS,May-30-2007,Tantalus,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Digital Entertainment News,78,If you have a little girl (or perhaps a somewhat effeminate little boy) that loves ponies you really can’t go wrong with Pony Friends. While it’s not quite as polished and ambitious as Nintendogs was it’s still surprisingly good and head and shoulders above most other virtual pet games.
The Escapists: Complete Edition,Switch,Sep-25-2018,Mouldy Toof Studios,Action | General,COGconnected,82,Filled with humor cuddly visuals and some surprising depth The Escapists: Complete Edition is a big game in a tiny little package. You might feel like a real prisoner at times trying to survive its grueling difficulty but its charm and reasonable price help to make this stint in the big-house a surprisingly fun experience.
Monster Monpiece,PlayStation Vita,May-27-2014,Compile Heart,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle,Digitally Downloaded,90,Managing your deck is nearly as exciting as the battles in its own way. Nabbing new booster packs and busting them open with the touch screen is a simple joy that offers a little joyful suspense every time you acquire new cards.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD,PlayStation 3,Aug-28-2012,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skating | Skating | Skate / Skateboard,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),80,But even with a limited breadth of content Tony Hawk HD manages to dish out more nostalgic fun for $15 than our last few retail purchases combined. [Oct 2012 p.83]
Zombie Apocalypse: Never Die Alone,PlayStation 3,Oct-25-2011,Konami,Action | General | Shooter | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,IGN,75,The interesting skill-based challenges and snappy funny writing give Never Die Alone surprising legs the flop first game wrongfully assumed it had.
NCAA March Madness 08,PlayStation 3,Dec-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,PSX Extreme,81,All in all NCAA March Madness 08 is not a bad game its just yet another bad PS3 port.
Nin2-Jump,Xbox 360,Apr-27-2011,Cave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,GamePro,90,For $5 you get a great-looking game as finely-tuned as any of Caves other arcade-style games making it more than the sum of its parts. Anyone into platforming action should give Nin2-Jump a go.

LEGRAND LEGACY: Tale of the Fatebounds,PC,Jan-24-2018,SEMISOFT,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,GameSpace,80,Legrand Legacy is a great indie JRPG that brings a lot of cool ideas to the genre. While it has its quirks and definitely bad controls with the keyboard the gorgeous visuals and gameplay make up for it tenfold.
King's Quest Chapter 2: Rubble Without a Cause,PC,Dec-15-2015,The Odd Gentlemen,Adventure | General,GamingTrend,75,While Rubble Without a Cause can be a little obtuse and less intuitive than A Knight to Remember it is still a worthy installment.
The Fancy Pants Adventures,Xbox 360,Apr-20-2011,Over the Top Games | EA 2D,Shooter | Scrolling | Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gaming Nexus,83,For someone who has never had the best relationship in the world with old-school 2D platformers The Fancy Pants Adventures acquaints it itself quite well. Exceptionally strong art design level design and music more than make up for the fact that sometimes no matter what you do Fancy Pants Mans momentum is going to kill you. However with all the secret areas and collectibles smartly hidden in each level theres bound to be something new to do when you try again.
The Legend of Legacy,3DS,Oct-13-2015,Cattle Call | FuRyu,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,100,Thank goodness The Legend of Legacy is on a portable system because once you start you’ll find time anywhere to play: you’ll get in a few more rounds of grinding on the bus or a few steps closer to your self-imposed goal while waiting in line in a government office. The classic JRPG elements combined with the characters the story the graphics and the music make this a game not to miss out on.
Super Bomberman R,PlayStation 4,Jun-12-2018,Konami,Puzzle | Action | Arcade,Video Chums,82,If you dont own a Switch and enjoy Bomberman then Super Bomberman R Shiny Edition is certainly worth picking up. Even though it doesnt improve everything from the original release theres so much content here that youre bound to have a blast.
Lichtspeer,PlayStation 4,Sep-27-2016,Lichthund,Action Adventure | General,ZTGD,80,Lichtspeer is a fun distraction from the current avalanche of triple-A fall titles; one that you will be able to dip in and out of as you please thanks to its simplistic gameplay and control mechanics. Never demanding a huge investment from the player but rewarding them if they put the time in.
Citizens of Earth,Wii U,Jan-20-2015,Eden Industries,General | Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,ZTGD,90,If you’re looking for a title with both style and substance and a hint of nostalgia Citizens of Earth is your next RPG purchase.
Metal Slug XX,PSP,Feb-23-2010,SNK Playmore,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,Worth Playing,80,As far as the franchise goes Metal Slug XX is pretty accessible and most action-oriented gamers will enjoy it.
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Classic Trilogy HD,PlayStation 3,Sep-27-2011,Ubisoft,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Digital Chumps,86,The original Splinter Cell games are classic and its nice to see Ubisoft give them the HD treatment. While not as complete as I was hoping for this Trilogy is still a great addition addition to your collection.
Brut@l,PlayStation 4,Aug-9-2016,Stormcloud Games Limited,Action Adventure | General,GameGrin,85,I really liked Brut@l. It has vivid graphics good depth a strong solo mode with its presentation of dungeons and the enemies and this was topped off with a really intuitive Dungeon Creator. There is plenty on offer here and it certainly doesn’t restrict itself to fans of the genre.
Oil Rush,PC,Sep-23-2011,Unigine Corp | Russia,Strategy | Real-Time | Modern | General | Modern,CD-Action,85,The only real flaw I can point out is optimization – Oil Rush slows down randomly once in a while. It does not impair its great playability though. [March 2012 p.46]
Golazo!,Switch,Sep-12-2019,Purple Tree Studio,Sports | Team | Soccer | Arcade,NintendoWorldReport,75,Golazo does a lot right even in spite of a few nagging issues with shooting and passing. I sincerely enjoy the presentation as it has a wacky yet still grounded feel. The single-player offerings aren’t all that deep but in a multiplayer setting this is an enjoyable sports game. It’s light and breezy with just enough strategy that it could rouse amusing competition out of a local multiplayer session.
Atari Flashback Classics,Switch,Dec-13-2018,AtGames,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Video Chums,85,Atari Flashback Classics for Switch is one of the biggest and best classic game compilations ever produced. Not only are there a ton of enjoyable games for any kind of gamer everything is implemented spot-on for big screen or on-the-go retro fun.
Yo-kai Watch Blasters: Red Cat Corps,3DS,Sep-7-2018,Level 5,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,90,Overall the game is fantastic. It’s fun for solo play and is even better when working in co-op. I’ve poured hours into the game and have still not completed every possible task available. There’s so much replayability and it’ll have you craving for more Yo-kai madness… or maybe a Yo-kai is making you think that. Regardless the game is definitely fantastic and I’d highly recommend adding it to your 3DS’s library.
Gravel,Xbox One,Feb-27-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Game Over Online,80,Overall Gravel is Milestone’s finest game to date. It combines a surprisingly high amount of racing types together and does an exceptional job with all of them. The handling is far better than most of their prior work and the level of on-screen excitement is at its highest point yet as well. There are some rough edges when it comes to the overall presentation and the FMV-laden story mode of sorts is somewhat of a groaner but it doesn’t take away from how fun the core racing action is. It uses rumble better than most games on the market today as well – at least for Xbox One controller users and is a solid pickup for anyone craving some off-road racing.
Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls,PlayStation 4,Jun-27-2017,Spike Chunsoft,Action Adventure | General,Digitally Downloaded,80,As with the main Danganronpa games there’s a number of serious subtexts to Ultra Despair Girls and actually digging into these themes makes it clear that the game’s a lot smarter than it might appear at first.
Vikings: Wolves of Midgard,PlayStation 4,Mar-28-2017,Games Farm,Role-Playing | Action RPG,COGconnected,80,It didn’t take long for Vikings to bludgeon those expectations into a meaty undulating pulp.
FORCED SHOWDOWN,PC,Mar-29-2016,BetaDwarf,Role-Playing | Action RPG,COGconnected,85,I think Forced Showdown has done a great job of incorporating different strategic layers on top of a twin stick shooter.
Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus,PlayStation Vita,Oct-14-2014,Tamsoft | Marvelous AQL,Action | General,The Vita Lounge,88,With a great combat system tons of customization options some great characters and a few hundred missions to go through Shinovi Versus is a must have for anyone who enjoys great combat - as long as theyre not overly sensitive to fanservice or sex jokes.
Rayman Raving Rabbids 2,Wii,Nov-15-2007,Ubisoft Montpellier,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,AceGamez,90,If you have more than one friend or family member to play Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 with then there are few excuses not to own it.
Ice Age 2: The Meltdown,GameCube,Mar-14-2006,Vivendi Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN,79,The game delivers a fairly conventional adventure packed full of collect-a-thons and tried-and-true been-here-and-done-that challenges. But it does them well. Control is tight levels varied and there are some genuinely funny moments.
Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir,PlayStation 2,Jul-12-2005,Racjin,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Game Chronicles,84,Extremely fun to play with fast-paced fights and a great combo system that puts the first game to shame. This latest installment is a huge step in the right direction for the series.
Tomb Raider: Legend,PSP,Jun-21-2006,Buzz Monkey,Action Adventure | Modern | Modern | Linear,Game Informer,83,But if you like to game on the go Tomb Raider Legend is a solid little addition to the PSP library and an adventure that is worth experiencing on any console. [July 2006 p.113]
Lollipop Chainsaw,PlayStation 3,Jun-12-2012,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | General | General,Digital Chumps,86,Amidst an important layer of absurdity brought to you by the likes of Suda51 James Gunn and Jimmy Urine Lollipop Chainsaw has a lot in common with the delightful 8-bit games of my youth.
Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games,Wii,Nov-6-2007,Sega | Nintendo | Sega Sports R&D,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,90,Its ideal both as a family game or as great post-pub entertainment. [Christmas 2007 p.64]
Warhammer 40000: Mechanicus,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2020,Bulwark Studios,Action | General,GameCritics,90,Warhammer 40000: Mechanicus is a clear win for fans of tactics and 40K alike. The gameplay is rich detailed and nuanced and the concept aesthetics and style are some of the best uses of the Warhammer license to date. No matter which way it’s sliced by a sharp articulated tentacle this one’s a winner.
Crystar,PlayStation 4,Aug-27-2019,FuRyu,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,100,I always have been whether its the writings on T.S. Eliot and Poe films from The Cabinet of Dr Caligari through to Blade Runner the music of Nick Cave or games like I Am Setsuna and now Crystar. That Crystar manages to be so layered and nuanced with that theme makes it all the more impressive. FuRyu continues to be the publisher to watch for anyone who likes their games with a bit of genuine artistic credibility.
InnerSpace,PlayStation 4,Jan-16-2018,PolyKnight Games,Simulation | Flight | Civilian,PlayStation LifeStyle,90,InnerSpace is a game that you should be playing. The well-realized worlds exceptional aesthetic and compelling exploration mechanics complement each other tremendously well. If you can get past the occasional bout of unnecessary complex exposition the evolution of each environment tells a compelling enough story to keep you enthralled from start to finish. Drop everything and check out what deserves to be one of the sleeper hits of 2018.
The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer,GameCube,Nov-1-2005,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,AceGamez,80,Worth a purchase for sure. Obviously younger audiences are going to enjoy the game more than older players but for any self-respecting Incredibles fan the story and the teamwork gameplay is enough to warrant a look.
The King's Bird,Switch,Feb-12-2019,Serenity Forge,Action | Platformer | 2D,Video Chums,80,Hardcore platformer fans will love the challenges that The Kings Bird presents while less skilled gamers can still appreciate the gorgeous game world via the incredibly helpful Assist Mode. Talk about going above and beyond!
Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds,PlayStation Vita,Aug-12-2014,Division2,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Nexus,80,As lovable as ever Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds is right at home on Sonys portable. It feels as though this is where the game belonged all along. Everything has carried over: the old school beat-em-up charm along with a heavy dose of gameplay variation and customization but the added portability makes it even better than before.
Dragon Age: Origins - Leliana's Song,PlayStation 3,Jul-6-2010,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,Gamer 2.0,75,Lelianas Song is an admirable addition to the Dragon Age: Origins storyline but with only three hours of content there really is nothing here to write home about. Fans of the game that are looking to gain some back-story on one of the games main characters should definitely check it out as it offers insight to some of the dialogue and story segments mentioned during Origins.
Shark Tale,Xbox,Sep-27-2004,Edge of Reality,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamingTrend,87,Shark Tale isn’t aimed at me. That said I’m having a ball playing it with my wife. The game is squarely aimed at those who loved the recently-released movie but there is enough nostalgia there for the whole family to enjoy.
The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring,PC,Nov-4-2003,Liquid Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Over Online,83,Being one of the first strategy titles based on Tolkiens locus classicus War of the Ring should introduce a good many movie fans to the strategy genre -- and most likely no greater percentage of Ring fans exists than amongst the gaming demographic -- but veteran real-time strategy players might want to look elsewhere if depth is what theyre seeking.
Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo,PlayStation 2,Oct-7-2003,Frontier Developments,Action | Platformer | 3D,Total Video Games,80,Its fun to play but more importantly captures the Wallace & Gromit spirit perfectly.
Naval Ops: Warship Gunner,PlayStation 2,Jun-25-2003,Micro Cabin,Simulation | Ship,PSM Magazine,80,Its an arcade game at its heart and its a whole lot of fun. [Aug 2003 p.32]
Star Wars Bounty Hunter,GameCube,Dec-7-2002,LucasArts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GameZone,90,While the game is a bit on the linear side it does a fantastic job of telling an interesting original story.
Dungeon Hunter: Alliance,PlayStation 3,Apr-12-2011,Gameloft,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Gaming Age,83,I like the dungeon crawling. I like the character customization. I like the loot. But most of all I like the multiplayer. With four players going at it the battles become pandemonium and I love it. Dungeon Hunter: Alliance has everything I look for in a downloadable title.
Teenage Zombies: Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingys,DS,Apr-15-2008,InLight Entertainment,Adventure | General | General,Hardcore Gamer,85,Teenage Zombies is pretty much the perfect platformer. [Spring 2008 p.52]
Fret Nice,PlayStation 3,Feb-4-2010,Tecmo | Pieces Interactive,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Gaming Age,83,Its a unique little platformer thats pretty much perfect for the service and while its ideal control scheme might have a few flaws to it the overall enjoyment I gained from playing it definitely outweighed the bad.
Just Cause,PlayStation 2,Sep-27-2006,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,Times Online,100,Fans of the Nintendo SNES classic Pilotwings will literally jump at the chance to parachute from any of the aircraft for spectacular views of the vast landscape below. There is bound to be a sequel because this original is so good.
Nelke & the Legendary Alchemists: Ateliers of the New World,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Gust,Role-Playing | General,GameCritics,85,The perfect melding of two genres Nelke and the Legendary Alchemists: Ateliers of the New World succeeds by taking the best elements of both and cutting all the fat. It’s an experience casual enough on both the management and RPG fronts that it’s the perfect game to introduce newcomers to the series. Most importantly Nelke is in touch with the series’ heart — at every turn this is a story about how anything can be accomplished if people are willing to work together and as saccharine as that may sound the heroine is so guilelessly positive that it works.
Katana Kami: A Way of the Samurai Story,PlayStation 4,Feb-20-2020,Acquire,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Action RPG | Linear,Digitally Downloaded,90,While I probably enjoy Katana Kami more as a cultural work than a game such as it is that’s so much more important to me anyway.
How to Survive 2,PlayStation 4,Feb-6-2017,505 Games,Action Adventure | Survival,God is a Geek,80,How to Survive 2 is a much improved sequel featuring some beautifully looking environments. There are plenty of upgrades for you and your haul and you’ll lose yourself in the menus if you’re not careful. The music is wonderful at times and it makes tense moments even worse even if it does remind you of the opening theme song of The Walking Dead. Whether you’re playing with friends strangers or on your own How to Survive 2 offers an authentic survival experience that has plenty of replayability.
White Night,PlayStation 4,Mar-3-2015,OSome Studio,Action Adventure | Survival,Hobby Consolas,80,A very special horror game that will leave something inside you after you play it. The attractive visuals intelligent use of light and morbid story behind it are its greatest assets.
Sniper Elite V2,Xbox 360,May-2-2012,Rebellion,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Game Informer,83,I went into Sniper Elite V2 with one desire: Disfigure Nazis from hundreds of meters away. The game delivers on this core mechanic beautifully. While I would have preferred enemies with less superhuman vision and better stealth options at the end of the game I couldnt recall a scenario I didnt enjoy. Sniper Elite V2 is a must for anyone interested in a smart shooter with an emphasis on gore.
We Happy Few,PlayStation 4,Aug-10-2018,Compulsion Games,Action Adventure | General,Cubed3,90,Whether interest lies in the survival horror genre or the first-person action adventure this is a title that delivers an amazing and heart-pounding 25+ hours. Its also noteworthy that a sandbox mode is coming to the game but as of release it is not an available option. Hopefully that means a lot of content post release.
The Spectrum Retreat,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Dan Smith Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,PSX-Sense.nl,85,A story-based puzzle game which excels mainly in the latter. Puzzles quickly become challenging and that makes for a fun experience due in large part to great audiovisuals. The image sometimes stutters while turning the puzzle but apart from this minor issue this game is plenty of fun.
Disney Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse,Xbox 360,Sep-4-2013,Sega,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Games Master UK,85,Superb remake that recaptures the originals magic while adding new twists to classic ideas. [Nov 2013 p.70]
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PlayStation 2,Nov-8-2005,Point of View,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,Worth Playing,87,In a sea of look-alike poker game clones WCP2 stands out as the one that feels most like playing an actual game of poker against actual people for better or worse.
Rise of the Triad,PC,Jul-31-2013,Interceptor,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,PC PowerPlay,90,This is the first-person shooter distilled a tribute to PC gamings glorious days of yore. You need to play it. [Sept 2013 p.88]
Another Sight,PC,Sep-6-2018,Lunar Great Wall Studios,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,The Games Machine,87,Another Sight deals with a difficult subject such as blindness through a skillful realization various mechanics beautiful graphics and an evocative soundtrack. Highly recommended.
Assault Suit Leynos,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2016,Dracue,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,Hardcore Gamer,80,Assault Suit Leynos is exactly what a remake should be. It takes everything that worked about the original and improves upon it with modern flourishes.
Train Fever,PC,Sep-4-2014,Urban Games,Simulation | Vehicle | Train,GameStar,82,Extremely addictive despite some weaknesses. A captivating world of model railroads.
Alien Shooter: Vengeance,PC,Feb-16-2007,Sigma Team,Action | General | General,AceGamez,90,As a no-frills action RPG this game knows what it is and does what it does exceptionally well in all areas - and I for one couldnt be any more ecstatic over how it turned out.
Fallout 4: Automatron,PC,Mar-22-2016,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,GameCrate,78,All in all Automatron is a good bite of DLC not a huge sandwich like were used to seeing from Bethesda and not out of the norm for the current DLC market. But like a lot of good bites it leaves us wanting more.
Penumbra: Requiem,PC,Aug-27-2008,Frictional Games,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamerNode,80,A sort of mixed-breed game thats fun but ultimately less captivating than its predecessor. For $10 by itself or $20 bundled with Black Plague its still worth picking up.
SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs,PlayStation 3,Apr-19-2011,Zipper Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,91,Ive played less than ten games on my PS3 and reviewed only three and Im proud to count SOCOM 4 as one of those games. Playing this game solo brought back memories of Full Spectrum Warrior with all the squad-based tactics and ordering options and playing co-op was like reliving all my best Tom Clancy moments and the online versus modes had all the fun of MAG with the added bonus of the incredible Bomb Squad mode. And while it may never be able to compete with Call of Duty in sheer popularity SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs definitely wins when it comes to reality.
Space Ark,Xbox 360,Jun-16-2010,Strawdog Studios,Action | General | General,DarkZero,80,Space Ark is a charming hybrid of a handful of classic arcade games. Its combination of score-beating arcade mentality and devious puzzle elements in the later stages make it shine against the murky backdrop of lesser XBLA titles.
WRC: FIA World Rally Championship,PSP,Apr-18-2006,Traveller's Tales,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Boomtown,90,The real meat and potatoes of the game lies in the championship mode. Hardcore fans of the sport will be delighted to know that it is an exact reproduction of the real life version.
Deception IV: Blood Ties,PlayStation Vita,Mar-25-2014,Koei Tecmo Games,Action Adventure | Modern | Strategy | General,Gaming Age,83,Is it repetitive? Sure if you dont get a perverse thrill out of launching people through the air and into the path of an oncoming boulder. But if you do — and boy do I ever — then Deception IV should be right up your alley.
NIER,Xbox 360,Apr-27-2010,Cavia Inc.,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GamingTrend,90,Its a game I adored without really being able to put my finger on why and even with the heavy-hitter AAA titles that have come out this year Id say Nier is simply one of the most enjoyable and unique gaming experiences of 2010.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China,PC,Apr-21-2015,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action Adventure | General | Linear,PC Gamer,83,A stripped down stealth offering that reinvigorates Assassins Creed by putting attention back on the sneaky stuff.
The UnderGarden,PC,Nov-10-2010,Vitamin G Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,GamingTrend,83,A higher level of difficulty and a lengthier campaign might have elevated The UnderGardens score but as it stands its still a terrific title that straddles the Zen and puzzle genres with style.
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts,Xbox One,Nov-22-2019,CI Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Jeuxvideo.com,75,With Contracts the Sniper Ghost Warrior series finally gets on the right track by focusing on the level design of closed environnements and featuring strategic gameplay.
Riverbond,Xbox One,Jun-9-2019,Cococucumber,Action | General,TheXboxHub,70,If you can look past the repetitive edge there is no reason not to pull friends and family together to sit down with this cutesy adventure.
Steel Rats,PlayStation 4,Nov-7-2018,Tate Multimedia,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,GamingTrend,85,Steel Rats is an awesome 2.5D platformer that makes great use of motorcycle based combat. The team of four bikers are badass and unique prompting you to try them all out and being able to switch between them on the fly keeps gameplay fresh.
My Memory of Us,PlayStation 4,Oct-9-2018,Juggler Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,PlayStation Universe,80,Where the game really exceeds is the beautiful and haunting retelling of the Holocaust as a robot invasion through the eyes of two children that won’t let their friendship be torn apart by hate and prejudice.
TurnOn,PC,Jun-1-2016,Brainy Studio LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,GamingTrend,85,TurnOn is an enjoyable and heartwarming little game. With electrical wires instead of platforms it offers gameplay that feels fresh piquing your interest at every turn with whatever new adventure or obstacle you’ll face next.
MXGP: The Official Motocross Videogame,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Motorcycle | Other | Motocross,Gamestyle,80,A great Motocross experience with enough to keep you playing for months on end.
Strength of the Sword 3,PlayStation 3,Dec-10-2013,Ivent Games,Fantasy | Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,Play UK,81,Brutally tough...As stylish and robust an indie debut as weve seen in a long time. [Issue#234 p.84]
Xotic,PC,Sep-16-2011,WXP,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Fantasy | Arcade,BigPond GameArena,80,Great for those moments when you have time to spare and you can outdo your previous performance. For most it will be just that - a great game to play for a bit but not particularly addictive. In some however it will inspire marathon gaming sessions into the early hours of the morning bettering your scores and those of others.
Fantasy Wars,PC,Nov-8-2007,Ino-Co,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Tactics,Pelit (Finland),88,A true blast from the past turn based fantasy strategy in the spirit of old classics from 90s. A bold move that succeeds. Commanding your own orc horde or mercenary army to victory through the linear campaign is simply fun especially when the game mechanics have nothing to be ashamed of and there’s plenty of complexity to keep you thinking. We need more of unhurried turn based goodness like this in the future. [Nov 2007]
Criminal Girls 2: Party Favors,PlayStation Vita,Sep-22-2016,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,While I don’t think Criminal Girls 2 goes anywhere near far enough to be the extreme Sadean experience that it clearly wants to be at least we have a game that achieves something down that path. Art needs extreme experiences and genuinely extreme experiences (aside from those laden with gore) are rare indeed in this industry. Kudos to NISA for not only taking a chance on the first Criminal Girls but backing up its faith that people do appreciate this kind of experience by localising the second too.
Do Not Fall,PlayStation 3,Jul-23-2013,Xpec | XPEC Entertainment Inc.,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,DarkStation,80,Do Not Fall was a bit of a pleasant surprise offering some nice challenge with an interesting mechanic.
Digimon World: Dusk,DS,Sep-18-2007,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General | Trainer,RPG Fan,75,Give this one a chance especially if youre into this unique brand of games. If you were surprised by the quality of the new Pokémon games or if youre a long-time Digimon fan this might be a game worth playing.
The Punisher,PC,Jan-18-2005,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Maxim Online,100,Its not all brutality. The Punisher is also one of the most immersive strategy games ever created. Aim for the head and enjoy.
Spider-Man: Web of Shadows,PlayStation 3,Oct-21-2008,Treyarch | Shaba Games,Action | General | General,Game Chronicles,96,Web of Shadows assembles a great cast of heroes and villains combines them with a fantastic story and integrates an intuitive and exciting control scheme and evolving combat system that easily makes this the best Spider-Man game ever made to date for any system.
Wreckateer,Xbox 360,Jul-25-2012,Iron Galaxy Studios,Action | General | General,Destructoid,90,While the storyline may be a bit hokey and the voice-acting a bit childish the fun that can be had with the gameplay and smooth easy motion controls just cant be denied. Its the best kind of fun: simple to play but hard to master. Its a casual motion controlled game that actually works well and offers up real satisfaction when that control pays off it high scores and massive destruction.
King's Quest Chapter 4: Snow Place Like Home,PlayStation 4,Sep-27-2016,The Odd Gentlemen,Adventure | General,Vandal,88,We loved this episode. It shows a sensible evolution being more mature and rising its difficulty. If you havent played this series yet its time to start.
Beat Sketcher,PlayStation 3,Nov-23-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Music | Dancing,Play UK,85,Its not only a fun game but shows off the Move brilliantly. [Issue#201 p.99]
Panzer Tactics DS,DS,Nov-6-2007,Sproing Interactive Media | Sproing,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | Historic | Tactics,Cheat Code Central,80,Panzer Tactics offer a great turn-based military combat alternative to the popular Advance Wars series.

Assassin's Creed II: Bonfire of the Vanities,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2010,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Pelit (Finland),81,Bonfire of the Vanities completes Ezio’s memories and is at least for now the last DLC pack for Assassin’s Creed II. This time around Ezio is tasked with the assassination (surprise surprise) of Girolamo Savonarola and his men. Removing Savonarola’s underlings is quite rewarding after Forli’s Cakewalk and you get to admire the full extent of Florence yet Bonfire of the Vanities offers nothing new. The adventure is worth its price tag particularly if you buy the Secret Locations along with it but nothing to exult about. [Apr 2010]

SpinTires,PC,Jun-12-2014,Oovee Game Studios,Driving | Rally / Offroad | Simulation | Racing | Vehicle | Automobile | Civilian,Quarter to Three,100,It’s not survival horror with trucks. It’s survival horror for trucks. You as a driver as a person as a foot on a gas pedal and a pair of hands don’t exist. Whether it’s because Oovee didn’t want to fuss with character models or because it’s an intentional effort to focus on the element of machines vs nature without mere humanity in the middle to muck it all up the world of Spintires is like Maximum Overdrive that dopey horror movie where trucks come alive and drive themselves around. Not for the cheese factor of course.

While there are still a large number of arcade-to-NES ports here the genre variety is much broader and fewer games have made appearances on previous compilations. There are still a few clunkers here but most of the titles are solid and while nothing is as sought-after as Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti was theres still a good collection here. For the retro fans this is worth checking out for $19.99.
Stela,PC,Mar-13-2020,SkyBox Labs,Action | Platformer | 2D,PC Invasion,90,Stela is a nice break from the hectic shooters and other competitive style games. It opts for impeccable sounds and visual design in order to convey emotion throughout the three-hour playtime. But dont let the overall length steer you away from something thats more akin to a short story than a full AAA produced title. Its a worthy experience from start to finish providing the right escape for those without a lot of free time on their hands.
The Council,PC,Mar-13-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,The Indie Game Website,90,The Council is a fantastic example of what adventure games are capable of with tons of content choices and characters you won’t soon forget.
