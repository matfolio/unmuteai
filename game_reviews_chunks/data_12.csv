Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,IGN,40,Its a fairly dull game with all of its pieces done well enough there just wasnt much put into this. And as a game on its own it doesnt hold up too well.
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Game Revolution,25,Too many technical problems and not enough fun drive this bike straight into the ground. Youll have more fun playing Hang On again with Shenmue.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,Stevivor,35,Ace Banana in its present state is barely playable with Move controllers.
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,GameSpot,38,Just about as broken as it was on the Xbox and PlayStation 2 last year and thanks to the ill-conceived introduction of a mouse and keyboard into the mix it manages to be even worse overall.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,IGN,40,Screwjumper! just should not have been green lit by Microsoft. There’s nothing redeeming about Screwjumper! no reason for anyone to give it a second look and absolutely no way you should spend ten bucks for the download.
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,PC Zone UK,39,The problems with the lack of inspiration or effort. [Christmas 2006 p.81]
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,RPGamer,30,At first I was enraged when I started to get killed all the time. Then I figured out how to just grind and the game became easy again until the final boss demanded further statistic embellishment to take down. Now that I have experienced the entirety of a Kemco title I too understand why this constantly-reviled publisher gets so much flak. Maybe other games under the Kemco banner are better: it wouldnt be hard.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,40,It isnt terrible its just dull. [Feb 2014 p.84]
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,GameShark,33,The game is extremely easy to finish in a single afternoon. Not that you should play it mind you. There are far better choices out there than Emergency Mayhem.
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GamePro,30,Protötheas music is the worst offender though -- its muffled tunelessness recalls the early days of hack composers attempting to extract vaguely music-like noise from the Super NESs default sound libraries. Expect lots of muddy bass and cheesy synth guitars.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Computer and Video Games,35,For every second of satisfaction there is a minute of monotony; where cardboard enemies fall under a cloud of red paint physics offer no value whatsoever AI is largely non-existent and gameplay follows the worn-ragged formula of coloured keycards and enemies that appear from thin air. [PC Zone]
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,You can enjoy the straightforward gameplay in some moments you can be surprised by the horror atmosphere. But those are only small details in the overall game of boredom disturbing mini-games and a bunch of bugs. [Mar 2009]
Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,PALGN,45,If you’re a pool enthusiast who finds they can’t get a table at the pub then Actua Pool will fix your cravings just don’t go expecting anything special.
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer,40,We saw plenty of good action/adventures in the year 2000. This wasnt one of them. [Mar 2001 p.82]
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GameDaily,40,Despite the differing game play at least one element remains shared between the various situations and scenarios of Eureka Seven Vol. 2: boredom. With no real skill required to complete the simple challenges most gamers will breeze through the dull segments given enough time and button mashing leaving them to question the point in repeating those same bits of play over and over again.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,35,Unlike the show it’s based on it’s both deeply boring and devoid of imagination. For a real sense of adventure play Spelunky.
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Games Radar,30,Xiaolin Showdown is a bad game plain and simple. In a genre where speed and chaos is an important part of gameplay Xiaolin Showdowns fights are out and outright tedious.
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,No amount of ragdoll-fumbling can save this Gothic horror show. [Sept 2013 p.94]
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,Games Master UK,35,Theres farming but little of the promised simulation. [Dec 2013 p.73]
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,LevelUp,40,Escape Dead Island is a terrible game with substandard graphics unimaginative and rigid gameplay convoluted story and unforgivable optimization issues.
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,CD-Action,40,With its fantastic art direction Inner Chains could have been a great walker. Unfortunately what the developers decided to make is a lame uninspired awfully boring first-person shooter that has absolutely nothing to offer in terms of gameplay. [08/2017 p.72]
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,TeamXbox,44,So if you can get past its many flaws—or you just enjoy repeatedly having your ass handed to you—there’s quite a bit to do here for 800 Microsoft Points (about $10).
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Yahoo!,30,For the price youll pay for both these games -- which is what youll need to do if you want a half-decent selection of activities -- you could buy the far superior Brain Age. Or for that matter you could buy just about any of the other genuinely good games on the DS and pass over this cash-in altogether.
MTV Sports: Skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald,PlayStation,Sep-12-2000,Darkblack,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,CNET Gamecenter,30,A slovenly title that drowns in its own inferiority.
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,IGN,30,There’s no reason any self-respecting gamer would pick up Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury. The game is broken at times painful during others and sports and overall felling of frustration for anyone brave enough to endure it.
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,MEGamers,30,Blood Drive is like a radioactive element - admired from a distance but never to be touched.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,40,Not even the most dedicated fan of the TV show could find this piece of garbage entertaining. Lock this let-down up and throw away the key.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,40,The gang vernacular and the gratuitous use of swearing may make this game appear cool but you may as well listen to an Andrew Dice Clay recording and play with a string-less yo-yo.
Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu,Game Boy Advance,Nov-24-2003,Webfoot Technologies,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameZone,40,Taiketsu just doesnt work. With bad gameplay graphics sound and multiplayer it leaves this reviewer complaining more than Andy Rooney.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Push Square,40,Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse doesnt make the best use of its licence. The humour isnt as funny in this format and the experience is padded by repetitive fetch quests. Fans of the show may derive some enjoyment out of the in-jokes and multiplayer but everyone else should avoid at all costs.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Kombo,40,The Golden Compass the book has received more critical praise than it can count. Unfortunately the same doesnt hold true for the movie or the video game.
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,35,Predictably you’ll have a much better time blasting away in by-the-numbers deathmatch team deathmatch and capture-the-flag engagements — well if you can find any other players in the ghost town that passes for Scourge’s multiplayer lobby. Given the game’s crippling problems it’s hard to blame folks for staying away in droves.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,Vandal,40,Maybe Motionsports original idea to make use of Kinect possibilites to offer a varied set of sport challenge. was a good one but ultimately it has been poorly developed and executed and control doesnt work well enough.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,GamesRadar+,30,The biggest problem with Acme Arsenal is that it doesn’t contain an inkling of the depth on display in the classic cartoons its levels attempt to emulate.
Real Steel,Xbox 360,Oct-12-2011,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Vandal,30,Real Steel is not a noteworthy videogame. It is a shame because the idea could have been great if it had been well executed. It has a very limited and repetitive gameplay and a lackluster appearence.
Soldier Elite,PC,May-29-2006,Metropolis Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer,35,If theres one thing that blows chunks more than a bad console-to-PC port its a recycled low-budget PC game thats past its due. [Oct. 2006 p.58]
Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,Underwater third-person shooter is good for one and only one purpose: if you want to see every possible game mistake bug and bad design decision packed into one you just got it. [Apr 2012]
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,35,Easy short linear and with embarrasing flaws in AI this game is a huge disappointment.
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,Multiplayer.it,40,Montagues Mount is a bad graphic adventure plagued by the backtracking and some of the worst bugs seen in recent years.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,GameSpot,40,The console releases are better than the truly execrable PC game of the same name but theres still no reason for it to exist.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Yahoo!,40,With the bugs fixed and the gameplay tweaked and polished Superpower could be pretty decent. At the moment its disappointing.
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamePro,40,Its too bad because Cursed Crusade has fleetingly interesting ideas like forcing you to push a very slow-moving mantlet towards an enemys defensive line or the way the timing of tapping out combo strings actually encourages thoughtful player response. Co-op can actually be fun in short bursts with a friend and even the detailed aesthetic is surprisingly competent.
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Armchair Empire,35,Gameplay is where UBS really screws up.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Game Over Online,40,It’s something you’ll play for a little while but you’ll soon realize that watching the real thing is far more exciting. It sounds better. It feels faster. And you’ll get to see the podium and hear the anthem of the victor’s nation.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,30,Tiresome nonsense. [Sept 2007 p.40]
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,God is a Geek,40,Drive Girls is a disappointing game in almost every aspect with only a few redeeming factors.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,Computer Games Magazine,40,You have to be jonesing for a decidedly old school arcade experience to appreciate Air Raid and even then its fun for maybe 20-30 minutes at a time if not in total. [Nov 2003 p.101]
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Electric Playground,35,Hmmm...step on a landmine play Green Rogue. Landmine Green Rogue...Ah! Landmine it is!
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PC,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PC Format,34,A perfect storm of cynical derivative design and slipshod implementation. [June 2008 p.102]
25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,ActionTrip,32,The bottom line is that it doesnt come even close to the open-ended gameplay of GTA and the overall quality of Max Payne. Drawing any further comparison with these two well-known titles would be a waste of time. In fact the entire game is a waste of time and money.
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GamerNode,35,Incredibly easy to use driving flop.
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Play UK,32,Unforgivable bugs. [Issue#220 p.81]
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Nintendo Gamer,35,Experimental racing concepts should be tested in the developers studios not on shop shelves. [Sept 2008 p.54]
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,A longer development period might have made this into something more playable but it would still be a game of rehashed concepts notable only for its sheer banality. [May 2017 p.96]
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,FNintendo,30,Its hard to recommend Senran Kagura Reflexions to anyone at all. Rather than a game this is more like a collection of screens that test the accuracy of the Joy-Con movements and at that it does work. Unfortunately it fails at everything else and it simple does not provide the content the sense of purpose and the structure necessary to call this a fun interactive experience.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Level7.nu,40,Manage a theme park and build grand roller coasters. A poorly designed user interface old-fashioned graphics and the lack of certain mechanics makes sure that this game never lives up to its PC predecessors.
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Yahoo!,30,For the price youll pay for both these games -- which is what youll need to do if you want a half-decent selection of activities -- you could buy the far superior Brain Age. Or for that matter you could buy just about any of the other genuinely good games on the DS and pass over this cash-in altogether.
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,31,An ugly collection of poorly conceived minigames The Polar Express is a failure by the standards of any medium.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,38,The game isnt funny and thats inexcusable.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,GameBiz,35,The musical score of the game will get on most peoples nerves within the first 20 minutes.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameShark,33,25 to Life does include a somewhat entertaining multiplayer aspect but not enough to keep your attention for very long.
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,NintendoWorldReport,40,You might be able to derive some enjoyment from this game but it requires overlooking absolutely essential elements gone awry making Hello Neighbor very difficult to recommend. If you don’t mind solving abstract puzzles and throwing everything (including the kitchen sink) at your objectives all while constantly avoiding a particularly annoying antagonist then you might give this game a try.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,IGN,35,The controls are awkward there’s no Xbox 360 Chatpad support and the puzzles are mediocre at best (and repetitive at worst).
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Meristation,35,Theres nothing worthy on the latest feelPlus work or at least nothing truly enjoyable. Were supposed to be very frightened by the scares that The Grudge repeatedly shows on the screen but the only scary thing here are the gameplay mechanics and the incredible stupidity of our main enemies.
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Portugal,30,Thor: God of Thunder is a game to avoid.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamingTrend,34,I have reviewed some bad games but this is even bad even for movie tie-in games. This is bad on the level of Aquaman bad.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,PC,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | Shooter | General | First-Person | Modern,3DJuegos,32,Raven Squad is bland boring and definitely not fun. Avoid it at all cost.
Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendophiles,30,Scream Arena takes a line from the movie and creates and entire game from it. It’s so thin that the single line in the movie is more entertaining.
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,33,So this is a pretty ordinary game that has potential in some areas.
Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,Xbox 360,Feb-10-2009,Tamsoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,Gaming Age,33,For me Onechanbara represents one of the biggest disappointments Ive felt in a game—it looks silly action packed and a little fun. Instead its just repetitive drivel with a bit of cheesecake.
Tony Hawk's Motion,DS,Nov-18-2008,Creat Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Pocket Gamer UK,30,Saddled with poor visuals ineffective controls and a complete lack of engaging content Tony Hawks Motion is a crushing disappointment .
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,Wii,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Nintendo Gamer,36,Instead of giving you the game disc the sales assistant could open the box and curl out a steaming log in there and youd have almost as much fun playing with it. [Dec 2008 p.56]
Cartoon Network Racing,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade,IGN,34,A bad kart racer in every sense of the word. The track design is poor the game feels slow and worst of all the controls are terrible.
The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,GamingTrend,35,I stared deep into the eyes of the deer waiting for it to speak. There was no grass no trees; just a white void surrounding me and her heavenly grace as she judged me and my actions. But she did not speak. She did not even blink. As the silence dragged on I grew more desperate bargaining with her to just make sense of this please! What should I be feeling? What should I be believing!? Deer God what lesson do I need to learn? She screamed for she did not know. I screamed for I did not know. Perhaps that was the lesson to learn that there is nothing to know. Don’t buy this game.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,Game Chronicles,23,You do nothing else while playing but hit the start and end button occasionally buy things for your store and manage employees.
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,TotalGames.net,37,To think this dire piece of programming is worth 40p let along £40 is an insult to everything we believe in as dedicated gamers. Buy it...go on we dare you. You’ll be the only fool that does...
Resident Evil: Survivor,PlayStation,Aug-30-2000,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,CNET Gamecenter,40,This lame first-person shooter with no visual or visceral delights is an insult to the brand name that is Resident Evil.
Realms of Ancient War,PC,Oct-4-2012,Wizarbox,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,XGN,35,In every review the main question is why would the consumer buy this? For R.A.W. Realms of Ancient War that is a question hard to answer. Yes it is an action RPG like great titles such as Diablo III and Torchlight II. But no we wouldnt recommend this game to anyone.
Inkheart,DS,Jan-12-2009,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | General | General,Armchair Empire,30,If you love the movie you might want to try this out just to see what it’s all about. If you are hankering for a decent adventure game with a book twist go grab Hotel Dusk: Room 215. It’s a much better read.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,Despite some noble efforts to take Tony Hawks back to its roots Pro Skater 5 is ruined by glitches sluggish movement and dull lifeless levels. What might have been a glorious return ends up an unfortunate swan song. [Issue#130 p.78]
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,PALGN,35,Quirky minigames can be excellent fun but the best collections offer variety. Spinning a wheel ad infinitum just doesnt cut it.
Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,3DJuegos,33,Pacific Rim is a very bad fighting game with a popular license.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,IGN,31,Nearly every gamplay mechanic fails in one way or another. While the game is functional Alone in the Dark is a clear case of something that needed to be baked in the oven longer. The overall concept is solid but the testing phase seems to have been glossed over.
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Next Level Gaming,40,The game is hampered by very bad laggy gameplay that seems like in some of the game levels (mostly all of them) it is running at 5 fps.
Putty Squad,PlayStation 4,Mar-11-2014,System 3,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Metro GameCentral,30,It seems very unfair to suddenly thrust such a dated game back into the limelight but it ready would’ve been better if Putty Squad had stayed in retirement.
Motocross Mania 3,Xbox,Apr-27-2005,Deibus Studios,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,IGN,38,Poor controls buggy gameplay and a lack of variety make this game a tour de garbage.
Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,PALGN,25,Saying that the DS version of Burnout Legends is bad is quite generous. Abomination is a much more fitting word.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,VideoGamer,30,While Dead or Alive: Paradise may appear exciting to a sex-starved 16-year-old the game is insulting to all other audiences; a huge backwards step in an industry desperately trying to mature. Remember this kids: ultimately youre getting yourself worked up over polygon meshes skin coloured textures and clever algorithms. Unless youre really struggling for ways to entertain your libido the game should be categorically avoided.
Battleship,Xbox 360,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Tactical,GameSpot,35,Bland presentation and sloppy mechanics sink Battleship more effectively than a torpedo ever could.
Battle: Los Angeles,PC,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Gamer,30,Good grief--I could buy Half-Life 2 with that $10. [Aug 2011 p.76]
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,Thunderbolt,30,Better yet let’s just leave the on-rails style in the ’90s where it belongs. It’s been a nice ride but we need to start moving on.
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,Everyeye.it,35,You need an extra dose of Painkillers to play Resurrection without headache.
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Wccftech,36,Umbrella Corp is a game that should have been scrapped not released. It may have started with the best intentions but the end result is a game that relies on tired gameplay and a familiar name. Going back to the drawing board would have been better than what was released now.
G.I. Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,GameSpot,30,G.I. Combats biggest shortcoming is that it has very little gameplay. Instead it has a heap of confusion.
Driven,PlayStation 2,Nov-6-2001,Bam Entertainment,Driving | Racing | Formula One,GameSpot,29,You can accelerate up to 200mph within seconds and survive a brutal wall impact but a low-speed scuff on the turf sends your car spinning.
Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Planet Xbox 360,33,If mind-numbingly easy repetition is what you enjoy in a game knock yourself out.
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameShark,33,Godzilla Unleashed lacks the vibrant larger-than-life destructive mayhem of other Godzilla titles and there really arent enough redeeming qualities otherwise to warrant a purchase…or even a rental.
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Games.cz,30,Darks concept is totally out of line and its technical issues are not helping it. Sometimes a good theme occurs but its bad gaming mechanics tread in the game quickly. Its bad as a stealth-action game. Its even worse as a vampire title.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,CD-Action,40,None of its elements is done well enough. The combat system is primitive and slapdash there’s practically just one enemy type with several skins and the level design based on simple greyish blocks is trivial. [CD-Action 06/2013 p.68]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,The Digital Fix,30,What we are left with is a dull broken button-masher of a campaign a risible barely playable multiplayer game and a couch co-op which puts most players on a level playing field with Mr. Magoo.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,GameSpot,35,Shallow combat frustrating exploration and crippling technical issues make Dragon Blade Chronicles a Naruto adventure to avoid.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamePro,35,In truth the biggest mystery here isnt how vampires evolved and rose to power but how any publisher could justify a $60 price tag for a tiresome exercise in imitation and slipshod execution.
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,IGN,30,If I havent made my point excruciatingly clear by now let me be very blunt -- do not play this game. Its plodding and dull and isnt even fun in an unintentional way. Just stay away.
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,MondoXbox,40,Project Root presents a very good base idea but with a poor implementation; we liked the idea of a top-down 360 degrees non-linear shooter but its generic art design many glitches and bad game design decisions keep it from even touching its full potential.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,IGN,35,It’s impossible to give that feeling when players have so little control over their own performance. If you’re looking for a golf game to play on Wii there are plenty to choose from. This one’s definitely not worth the price of admission.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,Destructoid,30,Just another ruined idea to throw on the ever-increasing pile. Not even the fact that one of the lines includes the term Satans little piss-pot could save this.
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,Game Over Online,30,Believe me Seven Kingdoms Conquest is a wreck you want to avoid.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,IGN,35,Kengos environment-based attacks nine storylines and Combat Mode simply arent enough to recommend what amounts to a boring and repetitive gameplay experience.
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,TotalGames.net,38,It’s sluggish and unresponsive and absolutely riddled with annoying bugs that should have been detected early in the production process.
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,Gaming Age,33,It was a mediocre game when it first came out seven years ago and if anything the benefit of time has made the mediocre assessment seem generous.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GamesRadar+,30,Rock Revolution is inferior to its competition in every single possible way. If you absolutely have to try it we urge you to think of it as a track pack of guitar-only songs for Rock Band or Guitar Hero and buy just the game (instead of the drums-included bundle).
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GamesRadar+,30,You’ll need the patience of Buddist monk to progress through the archaic Quest mode without consistently resorting to a cheap Ring Out.
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GamingTrend,30,Honestly the nicest thing I can say about Heavy Fire: Red Shadow is that it’s over in two hours. It is at least technically playable with some interesting mechanics. But even if you are specifically looking for a wave-based arcade-style turret game I’d still stay away. This game offers little of value and is fun only if I stretch that word beyond its absolute limit.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameSpot,37,Feels like a rushed hack-job of a game with just barely enough cohesive action to keep it from completely falling apart at the seams.
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Eurogamer Germany,30,In some weird way all of Lost Swords bad ideas remind you why you once loved the series.
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Not buying this would be the ultimate lucky escape. [May 2017 p.92]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,NZGamer,35,Maybe EA Games could rename Part 2 Harry Potter and the Multiple Revenue Streams. Because if we are going to be honest thats all this title really is.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,PC Gamer,38,Frustrating buggy and overly dependent on trial-and-error this is a missed opportunity.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PALGN,35,Unfortunately Acme Arsenal never really delivers. The gameplay is repetitive and bland never really offering a great deal of enjoyment. One of Bug’s quips as he topples enemies in the game is now this is fun. We’re sorry Bug’s but you’re sorely mistaken.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,DC Swirl,20,Acclaim needs a new engine and they need it to be radiclly different.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer UK,37,Smug poorly made and incredibly frustrating to play they managed the fearfully but not the wonderfully made. [Apr 2007 p.86]
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,30,Its an infuriatingly unbalanced unpolished and underwhelming experience that nobody -- not even fans of the movies -- should spend money on.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,GMR Magazine,30,This game is underthought quarterbaked and hopeless. Its one of the worst games on the PS2. [Feb 2003 p.66]
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Electronic Gaming Monthly,22,Its one of the worst games Ive ever played. [July 2002 p.128]
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Nintendo Power,32,Hit-and-miss action. [May 2002 p.140]
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,GameFocus,30,Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor is a great game when Kinect decides to obey to your actions but when there are simply too many switches levers and buttons in the game for Kinect to decipher what you are actually wanting to do it just makes the experience extremely aggravating.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,35,While it does have a lot of fan service it really doesn’t have much else besides clunky gameplay horrible visuals and repetitive gameplay.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Worth Playing,32,Normally a title like this would garner a much higher score; due to the inherent bugs however it feels like the game is half-finished. Since it seems only halfway complete the score will also be roughly half of what it would be in normal circumstances.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,Kombo,35,Soccer is a simple sport that relies on execution and precise play. Pure Futbol is executed poorly and is an imprecise mess.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameZone,30,Its not shocking that a movie game is terrible but it is somewhat surprising since Harry Potters last two games have been fairly good. The uninspired levels horrendous shooting mechanics lackluster controls and a tacked-on Kinect mode make this one Harry Potter piece of merchandise fans should stay far far away from.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,32,A bad conversion of an almost year-old Xbox game. Vengeance is playable but its a massively disappointing Wii debut for the Far Cry series and the worst FPS on the console so far. [Mar 2007 p.84]
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,35,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle originally started out as a PlayStation Vita game and would have released there a few months ago but for NIS Americas desire to do a simultaneous multiplatform release. A game of this quality wouldnt have been acceptable on the Vita and being on the Switch is only serving to expose its myriad flaws to more people. If you need to see girls beat the snot out of each other on the Switch theres already plenty of better options.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,New Game Network,34,The metroidvania-lover in me wished Randall turned out to be more enjoyable. There are some interesting ideas here like the use of mind control but the good of that is buried under a litany of technical problems and just general sloppy design. Like the titular hero I found myself frequently battling headaches during my time with the game.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,eToychest,30,Fans of the series will find absolutely nothing to like here and it’s likely that any gamer making Dark Secret their first Tenchu game will never buy another one.
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,AceGamez,40,This shovelware deserves no space in your home.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,GameSpot,39,Its not as if the Olympics be it summer or winter has had anything special to call its own when it comes to video game adaptations over the years but Torino 2006 is especially egregious in that it pares down the number of included events to a fairly measly number manages to make every single one of them completely uninteresting and skimps entirely on the presentation.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,GameTrailers,33,Pocket Pool is just another miserable attempt at using sex to sell a terrible game. While there aren’t many billiard options for the PSP pool fans should look elsewhere and avoid the embarrassment of their girlfriend catching them playing with it.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,Kombo,35,There are parts to like about Speed Zone and it wins some merit badges for the split-screen option. What doesnt go over well is perhaps one of the most crucial parts to a racing game the ability to control your vehicle.
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Cheat Code Central,30,The PSP version has so many things against it: the gameplay is terrible the story is non-existent and the entire game experience ranges from boring to enraging depending on how long youve been playing. I feel almost guilty giving ANY game this bad of a review. But trust me this one earned it.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,GameDaily,40,If you love the antics of Aqua Teen Hunger Force consider yourself warned -- Zombie Ninja Pro-Am is a bland affair. You get a subpar (no pun intended) golf game a lame cart-racing game and heaping amounts of monotonous combat.
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Electronic Gaming Monthly,30,Cmon were talking about a hack-and-slasher with stationary pinatas for targets here! [August 2002 p.126]
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameZone,32,There’s very little to like about the Nintendo Wii version of Legend of the Dragon and the fact that very little effort was placed in making the Wii technology fit the game is reason enough to skip this one.
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,A truly rubbish shooter that lies deep in Gears shadow pillaging it for set pieces designs and mechanics with zero subtlety. [Issue#64 p.89]
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,IGN,40,Like I say then leave this sucker alone.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,TeamXbox,36,Poor combat mechanics coupled with simplistic controls is where Fight Club begins to fall apart. A weak storyline that feels more like bits and pieces from a larger story told through still images rather than animated scenes takes so much more away from the game then they add making the process of playing through Fight Club more of an exercise in futility than entertaining.
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Games Master UK,31,Frustrating stealth sections uninspired puzzling and dull action make Agony gaming hell. [Aug 2018 p.73]
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,PALGN,30,A dull and poorly designed game. The mini-games are boring you cant save in-game and youll be waiting around a lot of the time. This is just a quickly rushed license title.
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,IGN,30,Its a slow and dull action game with very little technique. Top that off with NO MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT and theres really no reason to play this game. Its not fun.
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Gamestyle,30,Overall this is a hugely disappointing release from Midway who had seemed to be on an upward trend over the past few years. Hopefully Hour of Victory is the exception as this should have been binned long before arriving exclusively on the Xbox 360.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,35,Blackwater is a definite step in the right direction to providing the motion-based FPS like the one promised when Microsoft announced their Kinect camera peripheral. But between the controversial backstory the dicey subject matter the terrible presentation and the sketchy controls it is a game that is better left on the shelf. If you want a better Kinect shooter experience check out Gunstringer.
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,All Game Guide,30,Ostensibly a fast-paced adrenaline-style rendition of football the Game Boy Advance version of Blitz is a slow bare-bones pigskin game that bears little resemblance to its souped-up arcade inspiration.
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,Twinfinite,30,Left Alive’s half-baked nature feels like a real pity because quite a few elements of the game are actually really interesting.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Gamer's Pulse,40,The graphics are simply poor. The sound is painful to the ears at time although it stuck very close to the original game.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Planet Xbox 360,33,What at first sounds like fun for the whole family turns out to be a bad case of fun for nobody. Rocky And Bullwinkle is an unfortunate case of a good license slapped on a terrible excuse for a game.
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,Screen Rant,30,Every mechanic to the game needs drastic improvements and its just plain unfortunate that Otherside Entertainment released the game as-is.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameZone,37,Sometimes a game is just no fun this is one of those times.
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,VideoGamer,30,Its awful. As it is its a disaster of a fighting game. If the boxing in Wii Sports is Amir Khan then Ready 2 Rumble Revolution is Frank Bruno.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,IGN,31,An all around mess of a game Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing is officially one of (if not THE) worst examples of digital boxing weve ever seen.
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Push Square,30,Crystal Rift is far from an enjoyable experience with cumbersome controls lacklustre visuals and poor enemy AI. The entire experience gets very tiresome very quickly and with the ever increasing expectations for great quality games this just doesnt cut it. This rift would be better left unexplored unless you think youd enjoy its torturously repetitive depths.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,GameShark,26,Id have to use both my fingers and toes to tally up how many times the character suddenly materialized through a wall or walkway or big lethal spike-thingy and so on.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,GamePro,30,The crummy gameplay combined with Frogger 2s deceiving graphics (kids will struggle with this game) and jab-a-screwdriver-into-your-ear music make this one of the worst titles available on XBLA.
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Nintendo Power,35,Stiff controls and sloppy collision detection certainly dont help matters nor do the truly atrocious production values. [July 2007 p.94]
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,35,The mini-games are shallow and one-player only each turn drags on far too long and the sheer lack of any actual party elements keeps it from attaining even the basic – yet still redundant – entertainment found in the long-lived Mario Party series.
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Switch Brasil,30,Apparently Nintendo had to revisit Urban Champion at least once. We should all be happy thats out of the way now hoping that true classics show up next in the eShop as 3D Classics.
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Vandal,30,Lucha Fury is hardly recommendable even for diehard beatem up fans.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,30,Fluster Cluck seemed like it might be fun and have potential as a party game but I would honestly be more embarrassed to load this up and try to convince people to play it.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Computer Games Magazine,30,A great concept gone horribly wrong... Its too short too dull and too poorly executed. [Oct 2002 p.75]
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,GameGrin,30,I’ve read scarier issues of the Beano in this clunky buggy mess of a wanna be Deadly Premonition.
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,Cheat Code Central,34,When your game makes you want to skip the egregiously tedious gameplay so you can see what happens in the utterly forgettable story you know youre doing something wrong.
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,Game Chronicles,33,I honestly have to say that I had fun with this game just because the gameplay is so outrageously bad.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Level7.nu,30,Battle for the Pacific is a perfect example of how you can produce a modern first person shooter with absolutely no level of innovation at all. Graphics sound and controls all do their job without impressing but the overall gameplay is utterly mediocre and not worth your time or your money.
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,IGN,30,When the essential gameplay mechanic is this flawed and theres nothing else to save it theres simply no reason to play it.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,RewiredMind,30,I expected Torino 2006 to use its licence to present a confident and solid portrayal of the Olympic experience. It does neither – to be quite frank – and feels like an incredibly rushed affair.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,PC PowerPlay,20,A crime. Send this one to the colonies. [Feb 2011 p.65]
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,God is a Geek,30,A poorly written game with gameplay that feels stiff and archaic along with endless waves of enemies that take far too long to beat.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Cheat Code Central,30,This game borders on blasphemy... What you get is a slow paced game of hide and seek where it seems no one even cares to come looking for you.
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,VideoGamer,30,Kung Fu Riders bizarre and broken controls bear little correlation to whats going on in the screen and overall the game would function far more effectively if its commands were simply mapped to a DualShock controller. It would still remain utterly terrible however as the game is an uninspired mess built entirely around a core conceit that gets old surprisingly fast.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,40,NBA Live 14 is one of the worst sports games I played in years. Its incredible that the game shares the same engine with FIFA 14 and Madden 25 because of its choppy gameplay poor graphics and the lack of any ideas. 2K can sleep well.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Digitally Downloaded,30,There are some great ideas at the core of this though and it would have been nice to see how they shaped up with a bit more direction and some extra time in the oven.
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,IGN,35,Its ugliness assaults your senses right from the start.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,30,The How-To Guide Guide on how to murder a solid license the only thing this game succeeds in is being even worse than its predecessor. [Aug 2007 p.88]
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer,30,At best its a functional third-person platformer that sometimes acts like a shooter. At worst its an astonishing collection of poor design decisions half-hearted implementation and mindless narrative clutter that will only lead to buyers remorse in all who decide to give it a try.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,PSM3 Magazine UK,31,Even the most rabid of fans will be disappointed. [Sept 2007 p.80]
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,30,Orion: Dino Beatdown is a disaster. Bugs glitch and the lack of contents plague the entire production. It is more an alpha version than a finished game.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Console Monster,25,With a poor story out-dated graphics and no real depth to the puzzles and with so many great titles in the genre already available for the same price I would suggest you steer clear of this one.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Cheat Code Central,38,There are songs to play you cant get anywhere else but you should really ask yourself if you to play them on a real-fake guitar.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Kombo,25,The game isnt fun. The load times graphics presentation and lack of readable fonts and radars makes this game unplayable.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,28,Celebrity Deathmatchs biggest problem isnt its timing but rather its the absolutely horrid gameplay and complete lack of any worthwhile features.
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GamerWeb Nintendo,40,Good for kids. Good for people you dont like. Not good for you.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,PALGN,30,Do your childhood memories a favour by not playing this.

Legends of Pegasus,PC,Aug-10-2012,Kalypso | Novacore Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | 4X,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,Legends of Pegasus game is perfect example of how to turn ambitious projects into something you do want to forget as fast as possible. [Oct 2012]
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,Xbox 360,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Gaming Nexus,33,With terrible graphics and an even worse story mode Power Gig is sure to leave a bad taste in your mouth!
Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Edge Magazine,30,The games ambition far outstrips its creators abilities: damned by execution rather than intent but damned nonetheless. [July 2009 p.99]
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,TheSixthAxis,30,It’s not impossible to overlook Alekhine’s shopping list of shortcomings. There were a few occasions when everything would neatly come together and create something genuinely fun and entertaining. However the consistency simply isn’t there.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Nintendojo,30,It shall garner the first ever Eric Mattei Smelly Bowling Shoe award for achieving a new standard in caca quality.
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,30,Torrente may just be a new Spanish word for ‘terrible’.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Games.cz,30,Umbrella Corps is a multiplayer action with zero value. The game is flawed with all sorts of issues including dysfunctional matchmaking small number of players poor visuals and tragic AI of zombies. Hands off.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,It felt genuinely good to not be playing it anymore and that is a rare thing in games nowadays. [Oct 2014 p.92]
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,GameZone,31,Boring in all fronts: graphics gameplay audio etc. There’s not many redeeming values packed into Double D Dodgeball so the best advice is to play the demo and call it good.
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Cubed3,30,Arc of Alchemist feels so very dated it could easily be confused for an early Idea Factory title getting its remaster on Switch… without anything actually remastered. Unremarkable and uninspired its a quintessential mindless dungeon-crawling RPG with no real hook to set it apart. There are a million games out there that do exactly what Arc of Alchemist does but better in every way.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,37,A resounding failure. Unless youre a masochistic Fight Club fan looking to purposely have your sensibilities offended then youd be well advised to stay far away from this game.
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PSX-Sense.nl,20,What a horrible game. Combat is stiff and unpleasant. The badly positioned camera constantly gets on your nerves. Where to go and what to do is totally unclear. Bosses are uninspired and no fun at all. Everything in this game screams ignore me! so thats our advice to you. Do not buy this game - you have been warned!
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,Video Chums,25,In an age where people watch other people play video games maybe its time that video games simply play themselves. Hopefully that statement sounds ridiculous to you because it is. Gamers need gameplay and Tokyo Tattoo Girls has virtually none.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,PSX-Sense.nl,35,This game should have been the ultimate fan service to One Piece fans but unfortunately the game severely disappoints. The limited gameplay that the title offers is repetitive and doesnt add a whole lot. The parts where youre blasting ships and a Kraken is fun but wears thin very quickly. One Piece: Grand Cruise definitely had potential but the developer didnt take any chances at all.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,TeamXbox,34,The dictionary defines infernal as hellish fiendish diabolical as it should be but it also has a definition of extremely troublesome annoying. Unfortunately Infernal lives up to both of those definitions all too well.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,30,Terrible. Probably the only good thing to come out of the whole experience is the games opening song. Just imagine a driving 80s generic pop anthem with cheesy power chords and lyrics about how war is love and love is war.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,Gamers' Temple,40,If Jackass the show were as bland as Jackass the game it would have been cancelled after one episode.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpot,30,One of the worst action games of the last 10 years.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Computer Games Magazine,33,Enemy AI is shoddy as is the hit-detection. The graphics are also deficient with nearly every element in the game looking bland. [Apr 2004 p.9]
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,1UP,30,As I painfully maneuvered my Charlie from room to room I grew more and more desperate in my attempt to find redeeming qualities in the game.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,IGN,35,Apart from the energetic musical score theres nothing good about the Nintendo DS game. This is simply shelf fodder the game grandparents will blindly buy for Little Timmy because the parents took him to see the movie.
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,GameWatcher,30,When both the story and the gameplay are as weak as this then youre better leaving this on the virtual shelf and picking up Dead Space Extraction instead.
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,Destructoid,30,Its disappointing to see this sold on Xbox One and PS4 (with a retail release!) as if it is completed game. It clearly is not. After some substantial updates Id potentially want to give it another chance but as is I wouldnt want to spend another minute with it.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,TotalGames.net,30,Well we need a licence for sure...and how about some cool bands for the soundtrack?...Well I can’t think what else I would have written.Urm… I think we’re done.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gamestyle,30,The 2.5D graphics are quite nice and it captures the character and environment well but overall we can only really recommend this to parents who want to shut their kids up for five minutes.
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,34,This game is clearly a rushed mess and perhaps should have taken a nod from the Superman Returns video game and not been released until The Golden Compass inevitable DVD release.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,games(TM),30,To judge Enemy Front as a sum of its parts reveals it to be an FPS fraud - a pretender. [Sept 2014 p.104]
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,Nintendojo,20,Given that Wii Sports boxing (or Punch-Out!! for that matter) is better in almost every conceivable way Showtime Championship Boxing has absolutely no business in your gaming library not even for $20. Stay far away.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,GamerFeed,30,Fails to excite in any way shape or form.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpot,30,Even for the budget price tag that Miami Takedown is retailing for this bomb is a horrible choice for anyone and it should absolutely be avoided.
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,XboxAddict,34,This is unfortunately not a good detective game nor is it a good game period.
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,PC Zone UK,30,Even at its bargain price MOB is frankly appalling. [July 2009 p.73]
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,30,When a games only achievement is that its a better World War II shooter than Hour of Victory--and just barely--its time to pack it up and just go home. [Feb 2008 p.79]
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,CD-Action,30,Dear Kung Fu Factory please try harder next time because you showed some potential but I had to look for it through a microscope. [13/2013 p.73]
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,GamePro,30,Theres really no good reason to suffer Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga--its ugly broken and seems hellbent on depriving you of fun at every opportunity. Even if youre hard up for a Wii RPG youre better off skipping it and never looking back. Meanwhile Ill be hearing those footsteps echoing endlessly in my nightmares.
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,The Overpowered Noobs,30,If your goal is to never have an interaction beyond your basement this game delivers. Otherwise its only function is to give players a few laughs and severe second-hand embarrassment. Alternatively it could be turned into a drinking game with your buddies: Take a shot every time the camera goes out of focus the acronym PUA is said or there’s an opportunity to whip Big Richie out.
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Armchair Empire,30,Other than intentionally funny games like Day of the Tentacle and Monkey Island I don’t think I’ve ever laughed more at a game than I did at Fugitive Hunter.
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Five hours of playing this game will kill the entire genre for you too. [Aug 2011 p.99]
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,Eurogamer,30,King of Clubs doesnt play a very good game of golf and the unlockable elements do little to counteract this rather glaring flaw.
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Nintendo Life,30,With sluggish gameplay off-putting presentation and bafflingly poor design decisions at every turn Langrisser Re:Incarnation Tensei is an entirely underwhelming revival of a once-beloved series and a subpar SRPG besides.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PlayStation Universe,30,Shellshock 2 will shock you but for all the wrong reasons. Even if youre a fan of the genre its a technically inept and totally unenjoyable experience.
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,DarkStation,30,To put it bluntly don’t bother with Fireburst.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,GRYOnline.pl,30,Rambo: The Video Game is an awkward short ugly and expensive game that tries to generate some nostalgia but ultimately fails. Instead of spending money on Teyons creation its better to watch the entire game on YouTube or better yet - watch all the movies. And the best thing to do is: go for a walk find a video arcade and beat Virtua Cop one more time.
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,IGN,27,Poor graphics horrible animation and the lack of any challenge far outweigh whatever story this game might have.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,ZTGD,29,As a fan of competent twin stick shooters I found nothing at all in The Expendables 2 that would warrant me to recommend this game in any way. Boring gameplay drab levels and poorly produced content are the headliners here; avoid at all costs even if you are a fan of the movies. There are better games in this vein to spend your money on and one of them Tomb Raider: Guardian of Light is even free at the moment if you have a Playstation Plus subscription.
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Gamer's Pulse,30,The controls and gameplay are as poorly designed as the graphics and audio.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Gamer,25,Its not even remotely close to being fun and serves as a fine example of how not to make an action game. [Sept 2011 p.77]
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,IGN Italia,30,Please dont get fooled by Serellans proclamations and dont fall in the trap. Takedown: Red Sabre is a terrible first person shooter ugly to watch and painful to play. You wont get any fun from it even if you insist on fighting against its flaws. Stay away from it.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GamesRadar+,30,Avoid this one unless you’re a sucker for dickhead aliens. The Path of the Furon leads straight to disappointment.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Pelit (Finland),30,This game tries to ride with the same horse as Telltale. Although the names are identical the games themselves are just the opposite of one another. This is utter garbage in every single meter. Steer away. [May 2013]
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Its a genuinely bad game in every respect. [May 2018 p.82]
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendojo,35,The selling point of this game seems to be some sort of edutainment. Yet besides a few scant factoids in between levels the game boasts nothing worth teaching.
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Laborious and horribly put together Agony really will put you through hell. [Aug 2018 p.78]
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,30,To quote Galvatron This is bad comedy. [Aug 2011 p.90]
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,PC Gamer UK,36,Why am I empty then? Perhaps because this crass banal unchallenging belch of a first person shooter has left me that way groaning and giggling like a mental patient. [Nov 2007 p.72]
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,NintendoWorldReport,30,Do yourself a favor and hunt down the GBA game if you have an Astro Boy craving. Just ignore this pile which is 100 percent pure uncut shovelware.
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,Talk Xbox,28,The game play was weak the graphics weak and the audio even worse. I was fed up and bored with this game after just a mere six minutes of playtime.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,TheSixthAxis,30,It’s rare that I can’t find positives to talk about in detail and it’s a real shame that Fantasy Hero ~Unsigned Legacy~ game wasn’t improved in any way but simply ported with no tangible improvements over the PS Vita original. Fantasy Hero has the occasional solid mechanic in place but neither the story nor its gameplay boast any interest or originality. This game may have been considered pretty average upon its original release in 2014 but by modern standards it’s incredibly poor.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Computer Games Magazine,30,Just buy it on DVD and leave it at that. [Apr 2007 p.71]
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Gamereactor Sweden,30,There are loads of great fighting games out on the market right now. Girl Fight is not one of them and if you desperately need to watch girls fight there are probably better options for that as well.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,Electronic Gaming Monthly,27,The completely screwed-up camera noticeable lack of sound effects and gameplay bugs make it obvious no one working on this game cared about it - why should you? [Sept 2004 p.104]
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,GameSpot,27,It truly manages to re-create what it must be like to be on the wrong end of a mob shakedown because by the end of the experience youll pretty much feel like youve had your head caved in with a lead pipe.
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,Lets just say that the only way to ruin a party quicker than loading up Shrek Super Party is to load up Nickelodeon Party Blast. Stay away!
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Game Informer,30,As a downloadable title I wasnt expecting Amy to measure up against the triple-A juggernauts of the survival horror genre. However I was expecting a game that was at least playable and contained some kind of entertainment. Make no mistake: Whether Amy is delivered to you via download retail SKU direct brain wave or retinal implant it is terrible and should be avoided.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GamerNode,20,Compared to the quality of other PSN titles Kick-Ass does nothing to stand out. An array of unforgivable technical issues mar what is already a needlessly boring and repetitious beatem-up.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,Thunderbolt,20,The game is short damn short. It can be finished in about an hour or so and once you have sussed out the way the simple strategy part works all further enjoyment can only be derived from the main missions which Im sure youll realise by now cant save this Superman.
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,Play (Poland),30,Its huge. Its green. Its bad. And its lame. The comic and the movie rock but on a PC Hulk receives a thrashing from any budget arcade game. [Aug 2008]
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,netjak,30,The big draw aside from the fun cheating Mike Tyson parts is the damage textures applied to the face and the little blood spurts and sweat coming off your boxers face after he takes a punch...Once you take so many hits your boxer will go from bruised to cut to Face Critical! Whoopty-doo. One feature doesnt make your entire game Codemasters.
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,GameOver.gr,30,Thank God our daily bread and cereal is not dependent on this game.
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,Eurogamer Germany,30,Long story short: In its current state X Rebirth is just a sad affair.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,God is a Geek,30,Dawn of Fear is a poor attempt to recreate the magic of a survival horror classic with too many problems to gain any sense of enjoyment. Brok3nsite has tried to create a nostalgic tribute to Resident Evil but in the process they’ve somehow made it worse than the original. Perhaps its biggest omission and ultimate failure is its scare factor creating predictable moments of terror that never hit as they should.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,IGN,25,An absolute crapfest of a portable experience.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Play Magazine,25,Both the fighting and exploration are poorly executed and the visuals look like they leapt right out of a medium-quality NES title. [Jan 2004 p.76]
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Electric Playground,25,Dark Armies wretchedly tells you exactly what you need to do (i.e. move your units down by those trees and change their formation) but never gives even the slightest hint in the direction of the almighty how the hell that is done (i.e. what combination of keys and mouse buttons you must manipulate to get an action done).
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,Games Master UK,31,A poor game with next to no modes excitement or stuff to recommend it. [July 2006 p.84]
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Portugal,30,A frustrating game uninspired and just smears the name of the series that sells the most in the industry today.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Cheat Code Central,20,Mistmare has more bugs than an apartment in the Projects. The game is virtually unplayable. Its more horrendous than the Inquisition - and just about as much fun. I dont even know where to begin to lament on the inadequacies of this… abomination.
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,GamerWeb Nintendo,20,A game that shatters expectations but in the worst conceivable manner. What we have here is a game so awful that it truly is in a class all by itself. Its just mind boggling how bad this game is.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Gamestyle,30,In the end it proves too bland and generic for mech enthusiasts and just a poor game for the uninitiated.
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,Console Monster,30,Overall Megamind: Ultimate Showdown is a fairly poor game. The lack of anything innovative makes it just like the other movie-based games currently on the market. This is only one to purchase if youre an achievement junkie and even they might think twice.
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,GameSpot,30,Youll have more fun laughing at this light-gun shooter than playing it.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Play (Poland),30,He can fly! And thatd be about it - Iron Man cant jump climb the ladder or pick any Goddamned thing. When the novelty of flying wears off all that remains is a very disappointing shooter lacking any challenge. Oh and I saw much prettier games on PlayStation 2. [July 2008]
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Exceptionally poor: we imagine Bruce is rolling in his grave right now. [Oct 2002 p.109]
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,God is a Geek,30,Rekoil is a banal title with poorly implemented features confusing UI and ugly aesthetics. I can appreciate what Plastic Piranha tried to do but sadly they have failed to deliver on promises of balanced competitive gameplay – and even on some of the basic core mechanics of a competent FPS.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,Worth Playing,30,Zombeer is bad. The humor is scattershot and groan-inducing while the gameplay is barely functional.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,IGN,20,I can understand trying to do a budget version of volleyball but when 8-bit versions of the sport actually offer more fun (and maybe even look better) theres quite literally zero reason to take a look at the game.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,Its neither run nor funny - youre better off spending $20 on something else. [Jan 2004 p.125]
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,COGconnected,30,Going into Weeping Doll I was hoping to experience a horror game in the glory that is VR. Sadly Weeping Doll didn’t deliver much of anything except a simple puzzle solving game that feels undercooked.
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Yahoo!,20,A mess of a game. Its not even a game more like a slow rotting death. No matter how great your love for George Romero no matter how overpowering your curiosity there is no reason to look twice at Land of the Dead. Do not walk away. Run.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,God is a Geek,20,You really shouldn’t play Escape Dead Island. It isn’t fun and the only real redeeming feature is that it is technically playable.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,Games Master UK,29,Possibly the worst blotch on Sonics record. [Feb 2015 p.73]
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,4Players.de,30,That this cover shooter took a lot of inspiration from Gears of War isn’t a bad thing. At least if you compared it to the poor visuals the thin sound and the abysmal English localization that takes it far beyond trash.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,TheSixthAxis,30,Its dated looks slippery controls and occasional bugs don’t exactly help but the lack of originality compared to both Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams and Speedrunners just highlight the problems with this copy and paste effort. Go play Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams instead of this.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,GameZone,25,There’s very little here to challenge a first grader and the memory games are just way too insulting. Brain Age still the intelligent choice so avoid this one at all costs.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Games.cz,30,An interesting concept thats been realised into a totally horrible and dull shooter/stealth action crossover that I cannot recommend to fans of the series not even to fans of the Walking Dead comics. The only noticeable positive about it is its voice acting.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,G4 TV,20,The single-player mode is a painful and sometimes laughable experience. Multiplayer fares much better provided you can find people to play with online but there are much better titles out there to choose from.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Hyper Magazine,30,This is worthless rote action done much better elsewhere. [Nov 2012 p.78]
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,Eurogamer,20,This game gets a low score because there is no point to it.
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Game Revolution,25,Controls rather your body is wonky.
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,1UP,30,The problem is that it plays like Tony Hawks 1999 debut. Worse yet its not even on par with that.
Coliseum,PC,Jan-6-2004,Stormcloud Creations,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing,PC Gamer,37,This game got repetitious after about 15 minutes and downright treadmill-like within a half-hour. The emperors verdict: Thumb down. [May 2004 p.71]
Kabuki Warriors,Xbox,Nov-19-2001,Light Weight,Action | Fighting | 2D,Electronic Gaming Monthly,25,Mind-boggling travesty. [Jan 2002 p.231]
Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,MEGamers,22,Everything you can think of is wrongfully done in this game.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Hardcore Gamer,20,Like Birdemic or The Room Magus is so terrible that it can only be called a masterpiece.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,XboxAddict,25,I don’t particularly like pointing out so many negatives but when there’s virtually no positives to speak about it’s difficult not to. A nonexistent storyline basic and repetitive gameplay terrible and constant one-liners and nothing that makes it feel like a real Ghostbusters experience makes this game a difficult sell at $20 but it’s price is unfathomably three times that amount.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Total Video Games,30,I’m not sure why this game was ever made.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Slant Magazine,30,Robomodos Activision-mandated update most often challenges players strangely not to score big but stupidly.
Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,29,Not worth the time of you or your child.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,Destructoid,25,Does little to elevate itself over the antiquated genre it spawned from. The hand-drawn 2D art is nice and the real-world caricatures that act as bosses after each stage might elicit a smirk but the game is short shallow and unable to properly execute the simple tried-and-true beat em up gameplay style let alone advance it.
