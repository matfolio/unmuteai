Rayman Origins,PlayStation Vita,Feb-15-2012,UBlart Montpellier,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gaming Age,100,It's one of the best platformers I've ever laid hands on and it's a shame that I waited this long to play it. How this game didn't top more lists than it did as possible GOTY material in 2011 is beyond me because it certainly deserves all the accolades it's received thus far (and more!). I don't toss out the A+ often (in fact this is a first) but Origins totally fits the bill of what an A+ experience is all about.
Project Gotham Racing 3,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2005,Bizarre Creations,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,ZTGD,100,With stellar Xbox Live integration and an almost infinite number of ways to play the game Project Gotham Racing 3 is the definition of what next-gen gaming should be.
NBA 2K17,PlayStation 4,Sep-16-2016,Visual Concepts,Sports | Team | Basketball | Sim,USgamer,100,NBA 2K17 addresses most of my biggest issues from last year in cutting out canned animations and going back to basics with MyCareer and it's still as polished as ever. It's easy to take its excellence for granted but Visual Concepts' ambition and willingness to take risks keeps it from ever becoming stale. NBA 2K17 is the champion and it's tough to see it losing that title anytime soon.
Battlefield: Bad Company 2,Xbox 360,Mar-2-2010,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GamePro,100,It's the moment-to-moment excitement of each mission helped along by the cool and unique objectives that gives BFBC2's campaign an unforgettable edge.

Torchlight II,PC,Sep-20-2012,Runic Games,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,ZTGD,100,Simply put Torchlight II is a phenomenal game. It's incredibly polished and everything just feels like it's in the right place when you're playing. It's tons of fun to play and never takes itself too seriously and there are some great pop culture references sprinkled throughout. It's a great pickup for both action RPG fans and newcomers alike at $20 it's the best bargain that there is in gaming and something I would recommend to anyone without hesitation.
XCOM 2,PC,Feb-5-2016,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,IBTimes UK,100,It's a testament to the quality of XCOM 2 that despite performance hiccups on a mid-range PC I have been unable to put it down. It's at once radically different and reassuringly familiar improving what needed to be improved and refining what needed to be refined without losing the core appeal of the series. XCOM has once again proven itself to be the strategy king.
Dishonored 2,PlayStation 4,Nov-10-2016,Arkane Studios,Action Adventure | General,Telegraph,100,A grim gorgeous milieu of societal depth and cunning design.

What Remains of Edith Finch,Switch,Jul-4-2019,Giant Sparrow,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Nintendo Enthusiast,100,I can’t recommend What Remains of Edith Finch enough if anyone has yet to play it. With so many incredible games that are currently coming to Switch it’s important to support the special titles coming from publisher Annapurna Interactive. Its explorations of loss and tragedy left me emotional on numerous occasions yet it also holds an uplifting and edifying emotional core. This experience remains undiminished thanks to a comprehensive port that doesn’t make any drastic sacrifices to the performance and visuals. As far as I’m concerned it’s required reading for those passionate about storytelling in video games.
Injustice 2: Legendary Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-27-2018,NetherRealm Studios,Action | Fighting | 2D,Vgames,90,NetherRealm Studios are making a great job by keeping Injustice 2 alive and maintained. The addition of new characters and the multiverse are doing its job for keeping me playing the game for hours all by myself. In addition it makes a great party game and bust-a-friend game for a pizza night. I think they should get rid of the gear system but considering that you can disable gear effect by playing competitive mode it can be eschewed.
Cuphead,PC,Sep-29-2017,Studio MDHR,Action | Platformer | 2D,Giant Bomb,100,Come for the beautiful art stay because you smashed all your controllers.
Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Larian Studios Games,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Western-Style,Digitally Downloaded,100,Last year Divinity: Original Sin was one of my favourite video games when it released.

XCOM: Enemy Within,Xbox 360,Nov-12-2013,Firaxis Games,Sci-Fi | Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | General | Tactics,EGM,95,As far as expansions go Enemy Within takes a relatively safe approach opting to flesh out Enemy Unknown with new maps enemies and upgrades rather than redefining its core. Thankfully it works because the additions are every bit as smart and enjoyable as the main game.

Pinball FX 2,Xbox 360,Oct-27-2010,Zen Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Pinball | Pinball,1UP,100,They know traditional pinball well enough to design a great table and they know how to complement a table videogame with gimmickry without upstaging the gameplay.
Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions,PSP,Oct-9-2007,TOSE,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Tactics,GameSpy,100,The core tactical gameplay is the real gem here and its quality still shines 10 years after its first release.

NHL 11,Xbox 360,Sep-7-2010,Electronic Arts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,Gaming Nexus,100,In the end this is a game that's hard not to recommend especially in light of the fact that 2K Sports didn't offer a competitor on the 360 or PS3 this year so EA could have just stuck with last years game. Instead they upped their offering to the point that taking this year off could be absolutely the worst thing that 2K could have done.
Wario Land 4,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2001,Nintendo,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Age,100,Graphically the game looks fantastic. The game is insanely colorful and the sprites are well animated.

Call of Duty: Black Ops,PlayStation 3,Nov-9-2010,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Gameblog.fr,100,Congrats Treyarch you passed the test. Black Ops still has some technical flaws (some erratic scripts) but it doesn't lack ambition variety nor freshness. Its solo campaign boasts a good scenario and its multiplayer is as comprehensive and solid as ever while changing some basic systems for the better and introducing soon-to-be-cult new modes as well as community features one could only find in the latest Halo iterations before. There may be ways to improve it yet again but the 2010 CoD delivers on its promise - we can't say anymore that Treyarch's Call of Dutys don't measure up.

NBA Street,GameCube,Feb-17-2002,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,GamePro,100,Street’s sensational gameplay deftly combines competitive hoops and slick moves and dunks without delving into the realm of Jam’s absurd acrobatics.

But even more incredibly it's kept me rapt longer than any games I've played in years and shows no signs of letting up.
Unity of Command II,PC,Nov-12-2019,2x2 Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | 4X,Games.cz,100,A classic is born. This World War II strategy game is basically perfect and every turn-based general simply must try its comfortable armchair.
Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories,PSP,Oct-24-2005,Rockstar North | Rockstar Leeds,Action Adventure | Modern | Modern | Open-World,GamePro,100,On a visual level the game looks simply awesome.

Night in the Woods,PlayStation 4,Feb-21-2017,Infinite Fall,Fantasy | Action Adventure | Adventure | General,PSNStores,100,Night in the Woods culminates in some revelations made in regards to some of the stranger things happening within Possum Springs. It’s an interesting contrast to almost everything leading up to it and ultimately delivers an interesting message that I think resonates with much of what Mae’s character is dealing with. Night in the Woods is unafraid to embrace a wealth of issues that young people face in their daily lives. There’s still fun to be had parties to attend and songs to jam out to but it’s also about depression anxiety moving on and cherishing the things that you do have. Night in the Woods delivers a powerful message that resonated with me in ways I wasn’t expecting or prepared for.

Surprisingly online battles (no Nintendo Online subscription needed) work flawlessly absent of even a hint of lag or stutter. And even at odd hours (yeah I was playing at 4am what of it?) I never had any issue finding an opponent to battle against. Dragon Ball FighterZ is a AAA port of a AAA game and the Switch version is definitely the one to get.

Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror,PSP,Mar-14-2006,Sony Bend,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameSpy,100,This game simply doesn't belong on the PSP; it's too early for a game of this caliber to show up on Sony's little portable system -- hell it took nearly five years before "God of War" showed us what the PS2 can handle. Not only is Dark Mirror a damn fine game it may very well be the best game on the system.

Dragon Ball FighterZ,PlayStation 4,Jan-26-2018,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | 2D,Gamers' Temple,97,It's a dream game for Dragon Ball die-hards a great new way to test your skills for fighting game nuts and an all-around great experience for everyone else in between. The story and arcade modes present plenty of challenge and things to keep you occupied and the roster is large enough to make no two battles feel the same. And refreshingly the online modes appeal to not just those who have immersed themselves in online battles for years but newcomers and even just the mildly interested as well. At present time the PS4 version looks to be the one to get due to a few issues with the Xbox One's online capabilities but both versions perform even better than you might have hoped. For a game with nearly a full year of hype behind it Dragon Ball FighterZ delivers in ways that will exceed even the most lofty of expectations. This is a fighting game for the ages.
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening,Switch,Sep-20-2019,Nintendo | GREZZO,Action Adventure | Open-World,The Daily Dot,100,I found playing through a modern imagining of this classic to be almost perfect.
