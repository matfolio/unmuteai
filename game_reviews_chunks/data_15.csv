Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Konami,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,IGN,57,The stake through the heart of Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2 is its refusal to adapt new gameplay mechanics or inventive modes. We’ve been playing the same DDR for the last ten years and it’s high time that gamers stood up and demanded an overhaul of the formula.
Genesis Alpha One,PlayStation 4,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PLAY! Zine,55,Monotone missions and uninventive enemies combined with bad AI makes this game more of a chore than enjoyment.
Dr. Luigi,Wii U,Dec-31-2013,Arika | Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,Gameblog.fr,60,Dr. Luigis methods are closely based on Dr. Marios proven experiences but he dares to develop his own therapy through signature pills. This innovative approach speeds up the virus eradication even though it has secondary effects as the versus battles show. Its just a shame that only two players can benefit this treatment since the fun provided is really contagious.
Armored Core 4,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2007,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Jolt Online Gaming UK,65,Series veterans will love the endless customisation four-on-four multiplayer battles and blindingly fast combat but even the most loyal fan will wonder why Armored Core 4 couldn’t have been so much more than it is.
Kill la Kill: IF,Switch,Jul-26-2019,Studio TRIGGER | Aplus,Action Adventure | General | Action | Fighting | 3D,ZTGD,60,Kill la Kill The Game: IF is a unique title for sure. It lacks depth and breadth but makes up for it in wackiness and style. Fans of the anime will likely enjoy it but fighting game fans in general will most likely pass this one by. There just isn’t enough here to make it stand out among the crowd. One thing I can say about it though is that nothing is ever likely to be as bonkers as far as fighting games go…oh who am I kidding?
NASCAR 09,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2008,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Stock Car | Stock Car | Automobile,VideoGamer,60,Its hard to recommend the PS3 version though. With its slow frame rate and other graphical glitches its nowhere near as polished as the Xbox 360 game making this yet another port that hasnt been given enough care and attention.
Mazes of Fate,Game Boy Advance,Dec-6-2006,Sabarasa Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,NintendoWorldReport,65,Despite some good aspects I cant recommend Mazes of Fate unless youre willing to tolerate a half-decent game for 20 hours.
198X,Switch,Jan-23-2020,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,Gaming Age,58,As I said if you have an emotional connection to the era 198X may be exactly what you need in your life. But if you don’t pine for the ‘80s and arcades as a stand-in for your lost youth then 198X probably isn’t something you need to play.
SingStar Celebration,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,Multiplayer.it,70,Thanks to the new smartphone app integration everyone can jump into SingStar Celebration and start singing during your karaoke party.
Pro Cycling Manager Season 2013: Le Tour de France - 100th Edition,PC,Jun-20-2013,Cyanide,Alternative | Biking | Sports | Individual | Biking,IGN Italia,55,The console version of Le Tour De France 2013 tries to simplify gameplay too much by cutting away almost any managerial aspect and has some annoying technical issues especially in terms of frame rate. Its a mediocre game plain and simple.
Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor - Martyr,PlayStation 4,Aug-23-2018,Maximum Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Vandal,56,Martyr has many good ideas but the execution isn’t that good. It becomes repetitive very quickly and its poor technical side doesn’t help either.
The Baconing,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,IGN,60,If all you want to do is play more DeathSpank then this will certainly do the trick. For me once was apparently enough.
Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo,Wii,Oct-20-2009,Media Vision,Action | Adventure | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Age,50,While I think the idea behind a 3D brawler in the Dragon Ball universe is a decent idea I cant see the point in a game that only allows you to fight as Goku and keeps up the overall length that this game does. It does try to offer some replay value but not having additional characters to check out outside of the Tournament mode is a waste and not what I was hoping for with this game.
Heavy Weapon: Atomic Tank,PlayStation 3,Jun-11-2009,PopCap,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Gamers' Temple,58,Heavy Weapon is fun in short bursts but just doesnt give you enough bang for your buck.
Skelattack,PlayStation 4,Jun-2-2020,Ukuza,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpew,60,Skelattack offers an evening of fun with ample lashings of frustration along the way.
Fragments of Him,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Sassybot,Adventure | Visual Novel,COGconnected,55,Fragments of Him is a well thought out story that ultimately is undone by its gameplay choices. By trying to make gamers interact with the story more the story became even more inaccessible. While I can appreciate the sentiment that Sassybot was gunning for the delivery ended up being the undoing of a compelling storyline.
Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2014,Aqua Plus,Real-Time | Fantasy | Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | Visual Novel | General,DarkZero,60,In the end Tears to Tiara II is a well put-together game that’s hard to recommend in the long run. Had the game chosen to either be a full-fledged Visual Novel with proper saving features or a more evenly-paced Strategy RPG it would have gotten a higher recommendation.
Band Hero,DS,Nov-3-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,1UP,58,When it comes to bringing the full complement of instruments to the DS Band Hero represents a very rocky start. If it werent for the games shortsighted and unintuitive peripherals there might actually be something worthwhile here -- assuming you dig the soundtrack anyhow.
Aven Colony,PC,Jul-25-2017,Mothership Entertainment,Strategy | Management | Government,PC PowerPlay,60,Tactical city-sim for the sub-menu-phobic. [Issue#265 p.58]
Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe,3DS,Aug-29-2014,HAL Labs,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,God is a Geek,50,Dedede’s Drum Dash Deluxe may be plentiful in Nintendo charm and character but ultimately the gameplay itself is one-note and over-stretched.
Antigraviator,PC,Jun-6-2018,Iceberg Interactive,Racing | Arcade | Futuristic,TheSixthAxis,60,Antigraviator has tons of potential and there’s every chance that it could attain it a few updates down its spiralling road. However as it stands there are too many problems with the game’s underpinnings that the fantastic visuals can’t quite cover up.
Obscure,PlayStation 2,Apr-6-2005,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror,GameZone,60,It doesn’t even have those pop-out-and-say-boo moments that the first two Resident Evil games were famous for. That combined with clunky gameplay and lame monsters make for one obscure game.
How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition,PlayStation 4,Nov-4-2014,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Survival,Eurogamer Italy,60,A cut-and-paste version of the PS3/Xbox 360 with a bunch of extra modes and features.
Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes,Wii,Oct-12-2010,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,60,Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes isnt a bad game. The problem is that there is so little depth in the gameplay that the experience can quickly grow old.
Bee Movie Game,PlayStation 2,Oct-30-2007,Beenox,Action | General,GameSpot,65,Younger players will enjoy the variety and sandbox-style freedom of Bee Movie Game.
Crash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2007,Radical Entertainment,Action | General | General,Thunderbolt,60,It isn’t as impressive as the original games were but overall Crash seems to be making titanic steps in the right direction.
NHL 08,PC,Sep-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,GameSpot,60,NHL 08 offers up a few control tweaks and minimal updates to the dynasty mode but thats about it.
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,55,A kinder control and save system wouldve been nice but as is Gladiator will test the limits of your gaming patience.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PC,Nov-15-2001,KnowWonder,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,64,It also seems to me that most of the budget for the game went into licensing. I cant see that a lot of effort was actually spent on the production of the game side of things.
Stretch Panic,PlayStation 2,Aug-28-2001,Treasure,Action Adventure | Fantasy,All Game Guide,50,The novelty of the idea soon gives way to awkward controlling and discombobulating camera angles resulting in an experience sometimes more frustrating than fun.
Off-Road Redneck Racing,PC,May-2-2001,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Armchair Empire,58,Redneck Racing (RR) is to Redneck Rampage what X-COM Enforcer is to X-COM. The flavor of RR is definitely taken from Rampage but you won’t be battling aliens.
Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition,Dreamcast,Oct-28-2000,Climax Entertainment,Driving | Mission-based,IGN,62,I can see the appeal that Super Runabout: SFE can have with younger players who dont know any better.
Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour,Dreamcast,Jul-19-2000,Crystal Dynamics,Driving | Racing | Kart,CNET Gamecenter,60,You dont have to be a pre-teen or Chip n Dale groupie to enjoy Magical Racing Tour but it sure does help.
Afro Samurai,PlayStation 3,Jan-27-2009,Namco Bandai Games America | Namco Bandai Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,VideoGamer,60,Fans of the show are likely to get a kick out of the solid virtual representation of the key characters and locations and will probably enjoy the combat for a few hours. Problems will become more and more intolerable though especially towards the end of the game where bosses are bordering on unfair and platforming sections repeatedly make you want to quit the game there and then. Hardcore fans of the genre are even less likely to get anything from the game.
Brothers in Arms: D-Day,PSP,Dec-5-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PSM3 Magazine UK,59,Dodgy controls and poor AI ruin what should have been a belter. [Feb 2007 p.74]
Lovely Planet,Xbox One,Jan-8-2016,QUICKTEQUILA,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,IGN Spain,60,One of those games that lies to the eye offering a deep and complicated proposal that only fall flat on delivering a wider variety of challenges.
Mini Ninjas Adventures,Xbox 360,Jun-29-2012,Side Kick LTD,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Italy,60,Cute visuals funny gameplay and pretty good Kinect controls for a mini-games compilation unfortunately too short and repetitive to appeal a broader audience.
Powerstar Golf,Xbox One,Nov-22-2013,Zoe Mode,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade,Meristation,60,Play golf using the cloud and customize your characters with perks and accessories by gaining experience. One of the most interesting downloadable games for Xbox One launch window in terms of contents. Its good value for money.
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,Xbox 360,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Digital Spy,60,The lack of substance and new ideas on last years title feels like a let-down while the career mode just does not have enough flourish to keep peoples attention. Factor in the dismal graphics and the weak online game and WRC: FIA World Rally Championship 2 feels like its languishing at the lower end of the racing game leaderboards.
Dead Space 2: Severed,PlayStation 3,Mar-1-2011,Visceral Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamereactor Sweden,60,Good atmosphere as expected but old levels and only a few hours of gameplay brings this down a bit.
Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli,Wii,Aug-26-2008,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Other | Other | GT / Street | Automobile,Gaming Age,50,The controls are challenging when using the motion set up and while the analog control is better its still not on par with a standard game pad set-up.
Just Cause 4,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Push Square,60,Just Cause 4s traversal system can be wonderfully entertaining and the chaotic explosion-sim physics in play are frequently exhilarating but theyre manacled to a game that has absolutely no idea how best to use them. Whats the point in giving players an array of tools that lets them cause wanton destruction on a gargantuan scale and then designing a campaign full of drab copy-pasted missions that barely require you to use them? Its a bit like getting the coolest BMX on the market for Christmas but then your Mum tells you youre only allowed to ride it around the garden where she can keep an eye on you. Cheers Mum.
Tekken Hybrid,PlayStation 3,Nov-22-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Gamer.nl,55,The original Tekken Tag Tournament is included and is the only part of this collection worth playing.
Brave: The Video Game,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,Disney Interactive Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Linear,Gamereactor Sweden,60,Nice battles and nice pacing but the production values could have been higher.
Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code,PSP,Mar-28-2006,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Eurogamer,60,An average entry-level action RPG. If youre a heavy user of wizards and orcs youll have probably played something very similar only last week.
Skully,Switch,Aug-4-2020,Finish Line Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendo Life,60,Skully isn’t an entirely lost cause. There’s an entertaining enough puzzle platformer hidden underneath its myriad visual flaws. It may be uglier than sin and you may be accompanied by an irritating voiceover throughout but you’ll still have some fun playing through it and the plot does resolve itself in a nice way by the end. Youll just need to be able to roll with a lot of annoyances to get there.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2,PlayStation Vita,Aug-18-2015,Frima Studio,Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,IGN Spain,60,Not the best port made for PS Vita nor the best survival horror that we remember. Technically flawed still manages to entertain for around 6 hours.
Farming Simulator 2013,PC,Oct-25-2012,Giants Software,Miscellaneous | General | Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,CD-Action,60,This is not a product for a typical gamer and has plenty of shortcomings but it does fit lazy afternoons pretty well. But on the other hand so does blowing into ocarina… [1/2013 p.74]
Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Battle March,PC,Sep-2-2008,Black Hole Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpy,60,A tragically missed opportunity. There are hints of an excellent Total War-style real-time tactics game married to the undeniable crazy charm of the Warhammer Fantasy universe.
Crayola Treasure Adventures,DS,Oct-1-2007,Crave,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Thunderbolt,60,Its a good game but theres isnt much to it apart from colouring which is the whole point.
Delta Force: Xtreme,PC,Apr-22-2005,NovaLogic,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Gamer,58,This one will move a few units at Wal-Mart but no more. [July 2005 p.69]
Battleship,Xbox One,Aug-2-2016,Frima Studio,Miscellaneous | Board / Card Game,Attack of the Fanboy,60,Battleship is one of the original board games and has managed to stand the test of time over the years and now Frima Studio has managed to reinvigorate its core gameplay by adding more strategy than ever.
Depth,PC,Nov-3-2014,Digital Confectioners,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameSpot,50,Depth is the closest Ive come to experiencing the kind of fear a game about killer sharks should generate since my younger days of playing Jaws on the NES. Future updates that clean up bugs and add new content could help it breach the surface and approach greatness. Until then however Depth floats listlessly in the ocean current.
Titan Quest,Switch,Jul-31-2018,THQ Nordic,Role-Playing | Action RPG,SpazioGames,60,This new version of Titan Quest shows so many failures and problems about graphic and technique maybe due to the low quality of the whole work done too fast and with less content than the previous editions alas.
James Bond 007: Blood Stone,PlayStation 3,Nov-2-2010,Bizarre Creations,Action | Driving | Shooter | Mission-based | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gameblog.fr,60,Blood Stone has been a weird experience for me. Its playability is dynamic but wonky its production values are really inconsistent its linearity fades a little when playing in difficult mode its solo durability isnt so great but its multiplayer remains nice (though not great) and the non-stop action would be charming if there wasnt that repetitiveness. Pros and cons to sum it up. Blood Stone will not be a future reference thats for sure but Bond fans may still enjoy it.
ZEN Pinball 2: Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron,PlayStation 4,Apr-22-2015,Zen Studios,Action | Pinball,Gaming Age,50,On the positive side I did like the idea of a two-ball multiball prelude to open the table up with where you help Iron Man construct the Ultron A.I. It’s also somewhat neat to see it built as an optional thing even though I’m not sure I fully understand why you would want to skip it. Also if you manage to get the four-ball multiball for the final event it’s so chaotic that you can’t help but smile at the mess even if getting to this point is more frustrating and boring than it’s worth.
Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave Incident,Wii,Jun-29-2011,Sanzaru Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Hidden Object | Puzzle | General,Nintendo Power,60,Despite a few high points you can safely file this game under not bad but entirely skippable. [July 2011 p.88]
Zombie Panic in Wonderland,Wii,May-3-2010,Akaoni Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,60,I enjoyed the vibe of the game and the shooting can be fun in short spurts. The fun factor and the price however dont quite level out.
Daemonica,PC,Mar-31-2006,Cinemax | RA Images,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,PC Gamer,59,Daemonica is not the kind of RPG that will appeal to most hardcore gamers. [July 2006 p.77]
Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta,Xbox 360,Aug-3-2009,Bethesda Softworks,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,Destructoid,60,Do yourself a favor and purchase any of the other four Fallout downloadable content packs before even contemplating getting this one.
Urban Trial Tricky,Switch,Jun-25-2020,Tate Multimedia,Sports | Individual | Biking,Starbit,60,Urban Trial Tricky is simple...simple and fun and its good at what it does. While the game doesnt harbour AAA ambitions this is without a doubt a very fun way to pass some time and to enjoy the kicks and adrenaline rushes given by performing stunts on a bike. The experience would be better if the levels felt a little less claustrophobic but as a quick fun experience Urban Trial Tricky is a welcome addition to the Nintendo Switch catalogue.
Dead or School,Switch,Mar-13-2020,Studio Nanafushi,Action Adventure | General,NintendoWorldReport,65,The gameplay and exploration of Dead or School are surprisingly addictive but enough small issues give me pause in fully recommending it. Grinding for levels constantly upgrading your equipment and completing sidequests for stat boosts are all practically required. Its very likely youll encounter multiple final bosses that you simply arent prepared for. Fortunately many enemies respawn and save points refill your health and ammo in addition to functioning as waypoints. Fanservice images pop up from time to time but they arent overly egregious and shouldnt dissuade you from a purchase. If you can look past its numerous imperfections Dead or School is a satisfying and compelling albeit janky action-platformer that may be worth getting a hall pass for.
Conarium,PlayStation 4,Feb-12-2019,Zoetrope Interactive,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,PlayStation LifeStyle,60,When looking back at my time with the game I don’t feel horror at its revelations. I feel disappointment in light of what it could have been concealing and simply wasn’t.
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,PC,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,WHAM! Gaming,55,The joystick obviously offers the best option for control but the preset controls for the game are quite odd and for me at least changing the layout was not possible.
Serious Sam: Next Encounter,PlayStation 2,Apr-22-2004,Climax Group,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Game Chronicles,58,If you’re sitting at home in your ripped jeans watching Army of Darkness on VHS and have a crumpled Jackson in your pocket this game is not only calling you it’s running at you screaming with a hissing bomb in its hands.
Naval Ops: Commander,PlayStation 2,Mar-9-2004,Micro Cabin,Simulation | Ship,Cheat Code Central,50,I feel the game is lacking in direction. It feels like a make-work project with too-similar objectives and the putting of parts together. As far as Im concerned this game is just a piece of ship.
Conflict: Desert Storm II - Back to Baghdad,PC,Oct-7-2003,Pivotal Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,Eurogamer,60,For those expecting massive advancements or a radical departure from the original this will come as a disappointment. A more honest realistic assessment would be to treat this as a mission pack and for those who do just want more of the same youll come away a satisfied customer.
Disciples II: Servants of the Dark,PC,Jun-30-2003,Strategy First,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Computer Games Magazine,60,Scenario design in the new campaigns is overly reliant on puzzles. [Oct 2003 p.95]
Worms Blast,GameCube,Oct-24-2002,Team17,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,Game Revolution,58,Has the core of great puzzle game from the range of game modes to the interesting characters. Unfortunately the sluggish if workable controls put a damper on the overall feel.
Mega Man X6,PlayStation,Dec-4-2001,Capcom,Action | Platformer | 2D,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,Actually worse than its recent predecessors. [Feb 2002 p.116]
ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2001,Konami,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GameSpot,55,The game does have a solid and innovative franchise mode but given the available choices for football sims on the console it is tough to recommend.
Tetris Worlds,Game Boy Advance,Sep-5-2001,3d6 Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,Pocket Games,60,Great multiplayer support gives it a long lifespan though little ingenuity is here. [Winter 2001 p.52]
Razor Freestyle Scooter,PlayStation,Dec-11-2000,Shaba Games,Action | General,GameSpot,66,Seasoned fans of the freestyle sports genre will whip through Razor Freestyle Scooter in an afternoon no questions asked. It doesnt offer up any real variety in its challenges.
Gunman Chronicles,PC,Nov-19-2000,Rewolf Software,Action | General | General,Gaming Age,58,Gunman Chronicles isnt a terrible game I just suspect many of us have been there and done that.
Eat Them!,PlayStation 3,Dec-21-2010,FluffyLogic,Action | General | General,GameSpot,60,Laying waste to cities is fun but frustrating objectives and stiff difficulty prevent Eat Them from being a monstrously good time.
Trillion: God of Destruction,PlayStation Vita,Mar-29-2016,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Everyeye.it,60,Leaving behind the renowned lands of Gamindustri Idea Factory and Compile Heart present a new IP. Trillion: God of Destruction is a confused mixture of interesting ideas a good starting point for a series but nothing more than this.
Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns,DS,Jul-22-2008,Ninja Studio,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Roguelike,NintendoWorldReport,60,I’m not a fan of the presentation or the ridiculous grinding required for success.
007: Quantum of Solace,DS,Nov-4-2008,Vicarious Visions,Action | Action Adventure | General | Modern | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Nintendo Power,60,The games ideas are good but the execution doesnt cut it. [Jan 2009 p.90]
Fossil League: Dino Tournament Championship,DS,Jan-22-2007,MTO,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG,GamesRadar+,60,We really wish you could battle using multiple dinos at once but in the end the combination of paleontology and Pokemon won us over.
Eternal Poison,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2008,Flight-Plan,Strategy | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),70,Eternal Poison is built around three separate campaigns each with their own leading characters and unique encounters so theres plenty of built-in replay value. [Jan 2009 p.82]
Axis & Allies,PC,Nov-2-2004,TimeGate Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,Jolt Online Gaming UK,55,It’s not an awful game by any scale but it is tepid and flawed in its execution.
Journey of a Roach,PC,Nov-4-2013,Koboldgames,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Hooked Gamers,54,There are plenty of other games out there with more interesting puzzles and a more mature storyline. If your kids have a particular penchant for pests though this might be a decent game to play with them.
MotoGP 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-28-2008,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,AceGamez,60,This is the first time that the MotoGP licence has been in the hands of Capcom as publishers and Milestone as developers. The result is a solid game that doesnt really improve on last years offering. By setting its sights on accessibility MotoGP 08 seems to lose its focus on who its for and ends up providing something for everyone but not everything for anyone.
Dig Dug: Digging Strike,DS,Oct-18-2005,Bullets,Action | Platformer | General | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Armchair Empire,60,Simply lacks any lasting appeal. While it may be tempting to say that long-time fans of the series may get a kick out of the game if they’re purists they’ll likely have a problem with the gameplay tweaks added for this installment.
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts,PlayStation 4,Nov-22-2019,CI Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,While making a tricky headshot is always satisfying the environments enemies tasks and plot simply don’t grab your attention in the way they need to. It doesn’t help that the dull enemy dialogue where present has a tendency to loop if you linger nearby. AI is greatly improved from the last game but there are still line-of-sight issues. Ultimately the experience doesn’t have the tension of Sniper Elite nor the ingeniousness or replayability of Hitman. Sadly SGWC misses its mark. [Issue@#171 p.92]
Battle Princess Madelyn,Switch,Dec-20-2018,Causal Bit Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gameblog.fr,60,Battle Princess Madelyn tries to deliver a new twist to the old Ghostsn Goblins formula. Unfortunately its broken level design forbids Causal Games homage to reach the same heights as Arthurs adventure. With no clues on what to do or where to go even players looking for a tough challenge will only consider the arcade mode worthy of interest if they want to enjoy the games gorgeous graphics and art direction.
Poi: Explorer Edition,Switch,Oct-23-2017,PolyKid,Action | Platformer | 3D,Switch Player,60,Poi: Explorer Edition is a nice budget 3D platformer that is perfect for younger Nintendo Switch owners. The challenges in the game can become rather repetitive but if you are looking for a colourful platformer that is inoffensive and fun then you cant go too wrong with Poi!
Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,Namco Bandai Games | Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,TheSixthAxis,60,While Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment is an enjoyable budget release that offers hours of anime adventuring it’s tainted by inexplicable performance issues that simply shouldn’t have made it to the PS4 edition of the game.
Fairy Fencer F,PlayStation 3,Sep-16-2014,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,3DJuegos,60,A so-so JRPG based upon the mechanics established on the Hyperdimension Neptunia saga.
A Virus Named TOM,PC,Aug-1-2012,Misfits Attic,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,PC PowerPlay,60,Like trying to solve a cryptic crossword whilst blind and being repeatedly stung by mosquitoes. [Oct 2012 p.82]
Shotest Shogi,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2008,AI Factory | Rubicon Development Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,GameSpot,60,Shotest Shogi is a challenging experience that relies on you having at least a passing familiarity with the tabletop game that its based on.
007: Quantum of Solace,PlayStation 3,Nov-4-2008,Treyarch,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamestyle,60,Quantum of Solace is by no means a poor first person experience its just rather bland and decidedly average.
Barnyard,Wii,Dec-4-2006,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action | Adventure | General | General,GamesRadar+,60,Ultimately Barnyard is an easy mildly entertaining grab bag of minigames and missions. Kids will undoubtedly enjoy the game and their parents will find themselves sucked into numerous minigames as well.
Pac-Man World 3,Xbox,Nov-17-2005,Blitz Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Jolt Online Gaming UK,55,A painfully routine affair then and a missed opportunity to boot.
Dynasty Warriors 9,PlayStation 4,Feb-13-2018,Omega Force,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 3D,Attack of the Fanboy,60,Dynasty Warriors 9 felt more like an experiment than a single cohesive experience. At times it felt like Dynasty Warriors sometimes an open world RPG occasionally neither and sometimes both. But if Omega Force learns from this endeavor and buckles down for the next entry the result could be spectacular.
Super Motherload,PlayStation 4,Nov-15-2013,XGenStudios,General | Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action,Metro GameCentral,60,The visuals may make even Knack look like a system seller but there’s a quiet pleasure to Super Motherload’s simple but addictive gameplay.
SingStar Dance,PlayStation 3,Nov-1-2010,SCEE London Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Dancing,Da Gameboyz,60,For those that enjoy karaoke on the PS3 or enjoy SingStar games SingStar Dance is most likely a no-brainer so you might as well treat yourself. That being said it will cost you some coin to get a decent library of songs and the dancing elements in the game simply stink.
War the Game,PC,Jan-12-2015,GabberGames,Strategy | Real-Time | Military,DarkStation,60,If you want more story higher production quality and more layers of control that is fine but try looking elsewhere. If you are like me and not the greatest strategy player in the world but still want to feel the thrill of managing an army to victory then this game is for you.
MachiaVillain,PC,May-16-2018,Wild Factor,Action | General,GameSpace,65,It’s a fun and zany game with a quirky art style (feels similar to Don’t Starve) but it can be cumbersome. Also the randomization can hurt: I had to start several games over from minute 1 when there wasn’t enough free space to start building my haunted house. Also… the ability to have multiple stories would be nice. Haunted basements anyone? Attics?
Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D,3DS,Jun-28-2011,Capcom,Action | Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Shooter | Survival | Third-Person | Tactical,PALGN,60,Quality gameplay squandered by clumsy design The Mercenaries 3D misses the opportunity to become the definitive The Mercenaries game instead settling for a passing distraction.
Cate West: The Vanishing Files,Wii,Mar-23-2009,Destineer,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Boomtown,60,The gameplay itself is pretty average for the genre and the graphics do make it a bit difficult to spot some of the objects you are looking for but its plus points more than compensate. The games storyline holds the average gameplay together well the overall presentation is pretty good and to top it all off is the games budget price.
Birthdays the Beginning,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Arc System Works,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon | Action Adventure | Sandbox,IGN Spain,60,Birthdays the Beginning may be fun but it also has a very plain gameplay. A game that may be fun for the usual management players but with a very modest visual look.
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,Xbox,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Gaming Age,58,If the gameplay was a little more involved with less button bashing and greater emphasis on using combos for effectiveness it would provide a more fufilling experience.
EyePet & Friends,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,SCEE London Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Worth Playing,60,EyePet & Friends could have been a cute game for kids who want to play with a virtual and exotic pet.
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands,PSP,May-17-2010,Ubisoft Quebec,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,60,Aside from the disappointing revelation toward the end of the game Prince of Persia is a solid experience on the PSP. It expertly treads the line between giving us a taste of what exists on the consoles and offering unique and challenging gameplay that is suited to the handheld. If not for the sloppy missteps I would say that the Forgotten Sands would be a worthy addition to anyones PSP library.
The Escapists: The Walking Dead,Xbox One,Sep-30-2015,Team17,Action | General,COGconnected,65,While I wasn’t a fan of the resource management and crafting system as a whole due to frustration and lack of hints those with patience and who love experimentation will no doubt see hours pass by as they try to survive one more day to find that one item you’ve been searching for.
Exit 2,Xbox 360,Feb-25-2009,Taito Corporation,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,Official Xbox Magazine,60,It all moves at such a slow pace that theres no feeling of excitement or achievement in finishing a level. [May 2009 p.84]
M.A.C.H. Modified Air Combat Heroes,PSP,Feb-20-2007,VU Games,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Other,IGN,59,Although the gameplay is fun and the controls are easy to master the fact that you can play the game for half an hour and see just about everything possible makes M.A.C.H. an experience you dont need to plunk your hard-earned money to purchase.
Help Wanted: 50 Wacky Jobs,Wii,May-12-2009,Hudson Soft,Simulation | General | General,GamesRadar+,60,More successful as a single-player experience which can be seen as good or bad depending on your inclination.
Gauntlet,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,Digital Eclipse,Action | General | General | Arcade,Game Chronicles,60,Hardcore Gauntlet players will probably buy yet another copy of this game if for no other reason than the ability to play multiplayer over Xbox Live which is admittedly a good reason to play what is otherwise a very dated and boring game that will try your patience rather than test your RPG skills.
Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain,PlayStation 2,May-4-2004,Sony Bend,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,Gamenikki,60,Cooperative multiplayer and the basic gunplay thrills dont quite make up for bad control and ugly graphics.
Lords of the Realm III,PC,Mar-17-2004,Impressions Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General,netjak,62,Gameplay is horrendously simple...Ultimately Lords of the Realm 3 was a big letdown. It is still a rather decent game but nowhere near as deep as its predecessor.
Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus,Xbox,Mar-18-2003,Studio Gigante,Action | Fighting | 3D,Electronic Gaming Monthly,45,Playing Tao Feng is a lot like diarrhea; the longer it lasts the more irritated you get. [May 2003 p.134]
Strike Fighters: Project 1,PC,Oct-27-2002,Third Wire,Simulation | Flight | Old Jet | Combat,Armchair Empire,60,Civilians steer clear: this is definitely one for the flyboys.
S.W.I.N.E.,PC,Nov-19-2001,Stormregion,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Tactics,ActionTrip,57,Not only is the game easy and uninventive but it also has few units a poor AI and happens to be one of the least stable games I played in a long time.
Tennis Masters Series,PC,Nov-18-2001,Microids,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,GameSpot,59,Sluggish controls paper-thin career mode fictitious players and mediocre court graphics.
Hoard,PC,Apr-4-2011,Big Sandwich Games | Inc.,Action | General | General,XGN,60,Although the basic gameplay of Hoard is fun and entertaining the game offers little content. Its also a game that you have to play with friends. Luckily all of the game modes are playable online.
Juiced: Eliminator,PSP,Jun-28-2006,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Eurogamer,60,Its a content-packed well-produced handheld game - they can put that on the box if they want - but the racings a bit boring the load-delays are too regular and too long its very punishing when you start getting somewhere and the lack of online options hurts it.
Party Hard,PlayStation 4,Apr-26-2016,Pinokl Games,Action | General,IGN Denmark,50,If it had been balanced for faster gameplay with more traps Party Hard would actually have been a fun action game. As it is now though the party never really gets going.
MS Saga: A New Dawn,PlayStation 2,Feb-21-2006,Bandai,Role-Playing | General,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,MS Saga succeeds in creating one of the first truly accessible Gundam experiences while still giving the hardcore fans a reason to play. [Mar 2006 p.87]
Away: Shuffle Dungeon,DS,Oct-30-2008,Mistwalker | Artoon,Role-Playing | General | General,GamePro,60,An innovative and quirky experiment Away: Shuffle Dungeon never quite rises above simple hack-and-slash mediocrity.
Wild West Guns,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Gameloft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,Cheat Code Central,58,Though the presentation is tight the gameplay is quite dated and repetitive and at $10 (and 300 blocks of Wii memory) its no bargain.
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PSP,Dec-11-2005,Crave,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,50,The simple infrastructure multiplayer adds some replay value but overall this port is poorly thought out. [Mar 2006 p.97]
Crash 'N' Burn,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Arcade,G4 TV,60,This is not a game that will wow players with its graphics or its crash effects which are more half-cocked than insane but aggressive drivers who want to blow off steam will find Crash N Burn to be a smashing success.
Need for Speed Underground 2,DS,May-10-2005,EA Canada,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GameSpy,60,Although the game isnt on the same level as its console counterparts the DS version holds its own.
Painkiller: Overdose,PC,Oct-26-2007,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Positive,58,Overdose suffers most from its overall lack of polish. Had the levels and balancing received a bit more attention this could have been another solid entry in the Painkiller series. There is still some mindless enjoyment to be had here but the dated presentation and slow loading times conspire to spoil that too.
Bee Simulator,Switch,Nov-12-2019,Varsav Game Studios,Simulation | General,Switch Player,50,Bee Simulator is a charming game but one that never fully realises its potential as a true simulator. While at times gameplay was enjoyable the overall experience felt limited and the experience was more akin to an interactive educational tale.
Morphite,Switch,Nov-2-2017,Crescent Moon Games,Action Adventure | General,Cubed3,40,While it has all the makings of a long-lasting space adventure Morphite lacks any real emotion in the story it tries to tell while lacking the denizens to populate the various planets found within. Everything feels quite empty and lifeless made further haunting by Myrahs need to scan everything on the planet while breaking into temples to steal the rare Morphites that turn out to be…not so rare. This feels more like a concept piece for a brand new title and its hard to justify this as a purchase for what it offers currently. The story is bland the procedural worlds are even blander and the side-quests are completely broken and poorly maintained.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,DS,Nov-14-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer's Hell,63,A big mix of somewhat clumsy gameplay and great use of the environmental conditions of the land of Narnia.
Arena Football,Xbox,Feb-7-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,GamePro,50,While the overall control scheme works well enough kicking long range field goals through the notoriously tight uprights is far too simple. The limited playbook also gives the game a stale feeling and the half baked telemetry system fails to save the gameplay with largely unimportant statistical minutia delivered in eye-straining small fonts and obnoxious menus.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1: In Too Deep,Xbox One,Feb-23-2016,Skybound LLC | Skybound Games,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Twinfinite,60,The Walking Dead: Michonne is off to a decent start with plenty of room for improvement. Most of the new characters may feel like zombie fodder but they’ve got some interesting personalities that will be fun to follow. Plus Michonne may be immortal in the game but that doesn’t mean she won’t get banged up along the way through both physically and mentally demanding trials.
Sparkle 2,Xbox One,Jan-27-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Puzzle | Matching,Official Xbox Magazine UK,60,Probably better suited to a smartphone but mildly diverting for an hour or two. [March 2016 p.87]
Prince of Persia Revelations,PSP,Dec-6-2005,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Fantasy | Linear,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,60,Abundant faults make it impossible to recommend this over the original. Save your money and get Warrior Within second-hand on PS2 instead. [Feb 2006 p.98]
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2005,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,Gaming Nexus,60,Long on style and short on substance.
Outward,Xbox One,Mar-26-2019,Nine Dots Studio,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Survival | Open-World,Cultured Vultures,60,Though filled with interesting ideas and mechanics Outward is let down by poor combat dated visuals and performance issues.
Choplifter HD,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2012,InXile Entertainment,General | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,XboxAddict,58,While the game in its essence is a side scrolling adventure the frustrations of combining poor gaming controls with a lackluster HD graphic remake and next to nothing audio work make the 1200 MS point price tag an undisputed rip off of the gaming community.
Cookie & Cream,DS,Jul-2-2007,Hi Corp,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,50,If youre going to compete with the likes of Mario and Sonic you need a smart plan. And if you have a smart plan you better make it work. Cookie & Cream is only half way there. [Dec 2007 p.87]
Secret Files: Tunguska,Wii,Jun-22-2010,10tacle Studios | Fusionsphere Systems,Adventure | Third-Person | General | Modern,Jolt Online Gaming UK,60,While its true that Secret Files: Tunguska does get one or two brownie points for being in what’s currently a very sparsely populated genre on the Wii the fact that it’s so middling in just about every respect hardly justifies a purchase.
Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon,PC,Aug-21-2008,Kheops Studio,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,GameZone,60,This title is too conventional for its own good. Ultimately there’s no compelling real reason to pick this one up unless you just have to have another fix of the vampire mythos and don’t mind gameplay that can feel more like drudgery than fun.
The Awakened Fate: Ultimatum,PlayStation 3,Mar-17-2015,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | General | Roguelike,Multiplayer.it,55,Despite its cute look The Awakened Fate Ultimatum is a surprisingly dark and gloomy story which becomes borderline frustrating too soon and gives too little in return.
Blacklight: Tango Down,PC,Jul-14-2010,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,Absolute Games,60,Despite a lucratively low price Blacklight has no future. Modern Warfare 2 and Bad Company 2 are much better replacements if you want to just shoot at somebody and if youre itching for some classic multiplayer gameplay Counter-Strike Source is an excellent remedy for nostalgia.
Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,PC,Jun-10-2016,Frogwares,Adventure | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Sherlock took a few long steps away from the adventure toward the action gaming again. Although someone might actually like this change fans of the original game won’t be satisfied. [Issue#265]
Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond,PlayStation 3,Jan-7-2010,Vicious Cycle,Action | Action Adventure | Modern | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Fiddly controls. [Mar 2010 p.111]
Blair Witch,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,PlayStation LifeStyle,55,Ultimately Blair Witch is an intriguing story plagued by unsatisfactory gameplay with a few neat ideas sprinkled throughout. Your canine companion presents some interesting mechanics along with altering time through the camcorders but in the end even these features aren’t enough to save Blair Witch from being a chore to play. There’s still some to appreciate like the characters and story which make Blair Witch almost enjoyable.
Metal Wolf Chaos XD,PC,Aug-6-2019,From Software | General Arcade,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,Attack of the Fanboy,70,Metal Wolf Chaos XD is a totally unique experience that is worthwhile for anyone whos a fan of early 2000s action or satirical and off-the-wall humor.
Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 2,Xbox One,Feb-5-2019,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,XboxAddict,58,As someone who enjoys this genre and always has I wish that Milestone could strike gold and usher in a new heyday of off-road racing games. They have some building blocks in place but need to try to take more time with their games and polish them more before release. Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Video Game 2 is hurt by this lack of polish as well as some dated mechanics and middling gameplay leaving it a mediocre racer overall.
Smash Hit Plunder,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,Triangular Pixels,Strategy | General,Screen Rant,60,Smash Hit Plunder delivers an entertaining and colorful distraction. Smashing hitting and plundering is unquestionably enjoyable and while there isn’t a grand scope of variety puzzling out the best objects to break or hitting a scurrying creature with a carefully thrown crate feels just as good the tenth or twentieth time you do it. It may not make utmost use of all of the tools in the VR toolbox but Smash Hit Plunder is a lighthearted diversion that is worth your time and will probably be a big hit with younger gamers.
Gekido: Kintaro's Revenge,Switch,Mar-22-2018,Naps Team,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Nintendo Life,60,Gekido: Kintaros Revenge is a love letter to the original Game Boy Advance game that many probably didn’t notice was pushing the envelope as far as graphics animation music and presentation were expected on Nintendo’s 32-bit handheld. As such and despite excellent added extras to this Switch package it stubbornly restrains itself in the past and as is only truly recommended if you fell nostalgic towards the original game.
Human: Fall Flat,Switch,Dec-7-2017,No Brakes Games,Action Adventure | General,Vgames,55,Human: Fall Flat is a nice puzzle game with funny mechanics that make the first few hours engaging and good but after that the game can get quite frustrating and annoying. The game experience is improved during Co-Op plays but in regards to the game as a whole Human: Fall Flat falls flat.
Star Wars Battlefront II,PC,Nov-17-2017,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,PCGamesN,60,Star Wars Battlefront II houses a decent single-player campaign and good multiplayer but like the otherwise slick design of its multiplayer maps that accomplishment is often obscured by distractions. Normally my brain blocks out in-game monetisation letting me enjoy the game for what it is. Battlefront II changes that because spenders get a real advantage here. You cannot help but notice it encroaching on everything plastered all over the game’s convoluted drawn-out progression system.
Xenoraid,PlayStation 4,Nov-8-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons Ltd | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Twinfinite,60,When there are games out there like Rez and Geometry Wars that reinvent that chassis it’s difficult to play something like Xenoraid and feel… well much at all.
Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,ACE Team,Action Adventure | Linear,PlayStation LifeStyle,55,Far from a bad title as it does a great job of keeping some tension with its lite roguelike design and it contains more than enough content to warrant its $14.99 price tag. But if you’re like me and are particular about how a game should feel on a fundamental level then you may find that this one is lacking where it matters most.
War for the Overworld,PC,Apr-2-2015,Subterranean Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Eurogamer Poland,60,Interesting proposition especially for fans of the iconic Dungeon Keeper. For everyone else theres monotony and mild irritation.
Rio,PlayStation 3,Apr-12-2011,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Miscellaneous | General | General,GameOver.gr,50,Just another mediocre movie tie-in in the fashion of all the similar games that have preceded it and probably many of the ones that will follow it. It could be enjoyable but just for kids and only for a couple of hours. Thats about it.
Rogue Ops,GameCube,Oct-29-2003,Bits Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,AceGamez,60,Control although not debilitating ruins what could have been a very slick title and its similarity to Splinter Cell is brazen even down to the tutorial which is straight out of the Sam Fisher handbook.
Summer Heat Beach Volleyball,PlayStation 2,Jul-1-2003,Acclaim Studios Cheltenham,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,Electronic Gaming Monthly,63,Heats mushy [control] scheme relies too heavily on context making your beach bunny set when you intended an unstoppable spike and its overbearing interface banishes guesswork (and psych-out strategy) from the game. Still the virtual volleyball action is fast-paced fun. [Sept 2003 p.112]
Gungrave,PlayStation 2,Sep-16-2002,Seta Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,GameSpot,51,Gungrave definitely looks cool. Its also a textbook case for why great graphics dont do you much good if the underlying game is shallow.
Mad Maestro!,PlayStation 2,Mar-12-2002,Desert Productions,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Total Video Games,60,You get the feeling that this could be a nice little game that is more than the sum of it’s parts but sadly this is not the case.
Darkened Skye,PC,Jan-27-2002,Boston Animation,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Fantasy,ActionTrip,53,A game meant for gamers who are a bit younger and who enjoy cute sarcastic babes for main characters. So it all boils down to jumping around bashing recurring enemies with your staff and listening to your un-witty sidekick.
Monsters Inc. Scream Team,PlayStation,Oct-30-2001,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General,GameSpot,54,More sophisticated players will likely find this 3D platformer to be too repetitive and easy.
Thunderstrike: Operation Phoenix,PlayStation 2,Oct-15-2001,Core Design Ltd.,Action | Simulation | Shooter | Flight | Third-Person | Helicopter | Modern,Electronic Gaming Monthly,50,Later sorties throw so much annoying crap at you—too many enemies who pop out of nowhere too many mission objectives. [Jan 2002 p.222]
Yoshi's New Island,3DS,Mar-14-2014,Arzest,Action | Platformer | 2D,Eurogamer Spain,60,Yoshis New Island lacks that magic and special touch that only Nintendo knows how to apply to their products. Without that its a soulless platform game one that makes no big mistakes but never manages to surprise or even stand out from the crowd.
Alpha Protocol,PlayStation 3,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Theres just an awkward charm in its klutziness but Alpha Protocol is a tough one to love. [July 2010 p.112]
Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2014,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,USgamer,60,You probably know what youre getting into if youre picking up Dynasty Warriors Gundam Reborn. Any resemblance it might have to depth is purely superficial.
F1 2015,Xbox One,Jul-21-2015,Codemasters,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Game Informer,65,Once again Codemasters has created an F1 game thats true to the studios driving pedigree but fails on other fronts. It looks nice and drives well but unless youre so caught up in the F1 season that you absolutely have to sate your cravings with a video game you may have already played this game and put it down.
Monopoly Streets,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,Electronic Arts,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Vandal,60,If you like Monopoly youll like Monopoly Streets. But it you like it you will probably already have the table-top game at home and would prefer to play it without watching a television. But its virtue lies in the possibility to set up specific rules and add additional extras to a basic formula specially in online modes.
Danger Zone,PC,May-29-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,PC Gamer,53,This is a game about crashing that feels restrained almost sterile. [Aug 2017 p.87]
Diner Dash: Sizzle & Serve,DS,May-23-2007,Climax Group | PlayFirst | Climax Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General | Action,GameSpy,60,Even though the difficulty ramps up dramatically halfway through Career mode dedicated gamers will be able to complete the whole thing in a day if they dont get tired of the somewhat shallow and repetitive gameplay before then.
Mario Party 7,GameCube,Nov-7-2005,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Party,Deeko,60,Doesnt offer up anything different here with the exception of some new minigames and a freshly themed game board.
Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis,PC,Oct-29-2009,Fusionsphere Systems | Animation Arts,Adventure | General | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Lame voice cast destroys the atmosphere of this traditional adventure game. But there are some catching moments which make Puritas Cordis worth playing...pity there are only a few of those moments. [July 2009]
Spyro: A Hero's Tail,Xbox,Nov-3-2004,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,GameSpot,58,Spyros newly expanded roster doesnt manage to save A Heros Tail from monotony and even the titles targeted younger demographic will probably soon tire of the games reliance on boring collectible gathering.
Onimusha Tactics,Game Boy Advance,Nov-11-2003,Capcom,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Gamestyle,60,This isnt a bad game but in comparison to the heavyweights of the genre it just doesnt offer enough. An interesting diversion then but one that probably wont last you for very long.
AO Tennis 2,Switch,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,Nintendo Life,50,There’s a genuinely brilliant game hidden away somewhere in AO Tennis 2 but you need to have the patience of a saint to put up with its horrendous frame rate issues and the impact they have on its already tricky stroke timing system. The Career mode is a joy and the level of customisation and user creations is unlike anything we’ve ever seen in a tennis game so tennis fans may still want to give it a look as long as they can cope with its infuriatingly erratic performance. It may not be a popular thing to say on a Nintendo site but if you have access to another system you may want to look into how it runs on that instead.
Bloo Kid 2,3DS,May-7-2015,winterworks,Action | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,60,Bloo Kid 2 is a fun and competent platform game which perfectly captures the spirit of late 80s and early 90s platformers...perhaps a bit too much as it resorts to blatant copying of some of the biggest names in the field.
Naval War: Arctic Circle,PC,Apr-10-2012,Turbo Tape Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General,GamesBeat,59,As much as I enjoy some of the oddball strategy games available I cant bring myself to recommend this to even the most ardent grognards.
Go Vacation,Wii,Oct-11-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Eurogamer Italy,50,Another mini-game collection designed for young children and families. With Go Vacation Namco Bandai tried to make something different but they forgot one main ingredient in the recipe: the fun.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Autobots,DS,Jun-23-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Adventure | Shooter | Beat-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person | 3D | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,58,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen on DS is a whole lot better than the terrible movie and a decent action game in its own right. The online Battle for Earth mode offers new content for months to come but don’t be tricked into buying both the autobots and decepticons versions of the game—they’re basically the same thing with a different coat of paint.
Gear.Club Unlimited,Switch,Nov-21-2017,Eden Games Mobile,Action | General | Racing | Simulation | Automobile,GamePro Germany,58,A quite passable arcade racer with licensed race cars and with cleary noticable free-to-play roots.
Lucky's Tale,PC,Mar-28-2016,Playful Corp.,Action | Platformer | 3D,Edge Magazine,60,Despite its names implications this is a better game when youre following Luckys nose rather than his tail. [Tested with Oculus Rift; June 2016 p.119]
Crystal Quest,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2006,Stainless Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,TeamXbox,61,Crystal Quest tries its hardest to bring a slower variation of the style and substance that Geometry Wars so expertly crafted but it falls short of delivering the overall fun factor that other XBLA games have.
Atari Classics Evolved,PSP,Dec-19-2007,Stainless Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,AceGamez,60,The evolved angle isnt worth much unless you really want the ultimate Warlords experience (which is admittedly awesome).
Dusk Diver,PlayStation 4,Oct-29-2019,JFi Games,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,60,Dusk Diver is a noble idea. After all its clearly inspired by the likes of Persona and there arent many better sources of inspiration out there. Im also right on board with the setting. Having never been to Ximending I was quite keen to see what its like through the lens of this game. I didnt get to do that though because the game failed to capture the characteristics or community of the district. It was another hub-style location for another anime game. Throw in a functional but hardly boundary-pushing combat system and youre left with something that works but at this particular time of year a workmanlike experience is just going to drown under the weight of all the other really good stuff being released sadly.
Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2012,Pyramid,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Eurogamer Portugal,60,This collection is only worthwhile because of Budokai 3. It would be preferable if it were released individually on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.
Conduit 2,Wii,Apr-19-2011,High Voltage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamesRadar+,60,Sadly aside from a sharp online Wii experience Conduit 2 rarely impresses relying too much on generic drudgery and sad attempts to capture the magic of more popular titles; worse yet the storyline and characters seem aimless and forgettable.
Defiance,PC,Apr-2-2013,Trion Worlds,Massively Multiplayer Online | Role-Playing | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,60,Defiance is an interesting mix between an MMO and a FPS fun to play and with many things to do. Too bad for the poor AI and a certain lack of variety.
Battles of Prince of Persia,DS,Dec-6-2005,Ubisoft Montreal,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,NintendoWorldReport,55,Though the games stylus-based controls are tight and for a while seems to offer a nice distraction it soon becomes a chore to pick it up at all. With little story incentive and no hope for variety you probably wont make it past the halfway mark.
Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Aspyr | Aspire,Action Adventure | Linear,Switch Player,60,Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast has the makings of a great Star Wars game inside it but an incredibly frustrating front-end makes getting to the enjoyable meat a chore and will likely turn off most modern players.
Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters: Daybreak Special Gigs,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Arc System Works | Now Production,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Eurogamer Italy,60,Welcomed on PS4 for players who missed the original but this new version is not so special for those who have already played the game on PS3 and PS Vita.
Master of Orion 3,PC,Feb-25-2003,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | 4X,All Game Guide,50,In spite of Master of Orion 3s countless detail-oriented improvements connoisseurs of the series may also find themselves pining for the personality of the earlier games wishing to trade some of the new intricacy and erudition for a better sense of interaction and consequence.
Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts,Xbox 360,May-17-2011,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,SpazioGames,58,There are good ideas in this DLC. A real shame for the bugs and the overall lack of content.
Cargo! The Quest for Gravity,PC,Apr-21-2011,Ice-Pick Lodge,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,55,Cargo: The Quest for Gravity pulls you in with its surreal visuals and strange premise but its gameplay rarely gets off the ground.
theHunter: Call of the Wild,PC,Feb-16-2017,Expansive Worlds,Sports | Individual | Nature | Hunting,PC Gamer,60,Boasts some beautiful convincing countryside to hunt in but the glacial pace will challenge the limits of most people’s patience.
StarDrone,PlayStation 3,Apr-5-2011,Beatshapers,Action | General | General,GameSpot,60,Stardrones vibrant physics-driven arcade action suffers from difficulty spikes and frustrating design elements.
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2004,Interplay,Role-Playing | Action RPG,eToychest,60,This game just sullies the name of Fallout and cheapens it.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,PlayStation 2,Dec-8-2003,Paradigm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Maxim Online,60,While the tough stealthy game play won’t grip you in a chokehold of novelty and surprise it flashes a lethal look and feel.
Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm,PC,Sep-26-2002,3DO,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General,GameSpy,58,A disappointing expansion for Heroes IV. The few new items available couldve easily been available for free while the biggest change to the game - multiplayer -- is already free.
ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,Is this what real snowboarding is like? Because if it is I dont want any part of it. [Feb 2002 p.106]
Silent Scope 2: Dark Silhouette,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2001,KCET,Action | Shooter | Rail,GameSpot,55,While the gameplay and graphics are just about identical to those of the arcade version the lack of that big gimmicky sniper rifle makes the game downright silly.
Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff,PlayStation 2,Apr-18-2001,New World Computing,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG,GameSpot,52,Has a few surprises and some significant flaws. While die-hard strategy fans and extreme fans of the Heroes series on the PC might get a kick out of this one its really a rental at best.
Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business,PC,Nov-30-2000,Sir-Tech Software Inc.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | Tactics,Gamezilla!,64,Combined with repetitive gameplay where you march fight march fight rearm again and again this game can get pretty boring at times.
Assassin's Creed Liberation HD,PlayStation 3,Jan-14-2014,Ubisoft Sofia,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Digital Spy,60,Assassins Creed: Liberation HD offers a number of improvements over the Vita original some of which enhance the experience by facilitating smoother gameplay yet many of the titles weaknesses are amplified on the larger screen.
UEFA Euro 2012,PC,Apr-24-2012,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,Absolute Games,48,For an official game UEFA Euro 2012 is chock-full of unlicensed teams. Its easy to swallow false strips and fake player names in a team from lets say Lichtenstein but when the tournaments host nations Poland and Ukraine get the same treatment its just bad.
We Cheer 2,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Machatin | Inc.,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,GamePro,50,Its like playing Simon Says with a Simon that never attempts to fool you and is really into teeny-bop pop; if the graphics were a person her ugliness would prevent her from making the squad; controls arent precise enough.
Murder in the Abbey,PC,Aug-26-2008,Alcachofa Soft,Adventure | General | General,GameStar,58,At the beginning it looks like investigating secretly rummaging the abbey and questioning other characters could be fun but the game turns out to be made of pointless little riddles and requires searching through the same locations over and over again. Why somebody did something doesnt seem to matter at all. The Abbey is not about playing through a story its about forcing the player to solve riddles. At least the music by Emilio de Paz is well done.
Wild ARMs XF,PSP,Mar-11-2008,Media Vision,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,IGN,58,The gameplay just has too many holes to be enjoyable. The objective-based battles arent particularly well designed and character class implementation takes away a lot of player freedom.
The Sinking City,PlayStation 4,Jun-25-2019,Frogwares,Action Adventure | Survival,Gamers Heroes,60,Those invested in the Cthulhu mythos might be interested in the tale found in The Sinking City but most others should wait until the game is patched.
Corruption 2029,PC,Feb-17-2020,The Bearded Ladies Consulting,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Riot Pixels,56,Corruption 2029 is a shameless clone of Mutant Year Zero minus everything that was good in the original game.
Urban Trial Freestyle,3DS,Jun-27-2013,Strangelands Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Driving | Racing | General | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gamers\' Temple,64,Not too bad while it lasts but it doesnt last long.
The Legend of Korra,PC,Oct-21-2014,PlatinumGames,Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,Merlin'in Kazanı (Turkey),60,The Legend of Korra Game is a unfortunate game. Game has a big potential but we have to play a unfinished game. It’s a fun but buggy game. You will find Legend of Korra both pain and pleasure.
Pressure,PC,Mar-26-2013,Chasing Carrots,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Riot Pixels,60,The best way to describe Pressure is bland. Aside from three entertaining boss encounters it is monotonous and charmless.
Dragon Age II: Legacy,Xbox 360,Jul-26-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Action RPG,Game Revolution,58,Unless youre a completionist I see little need to spend your precious sovereign on this one.
MXGP Pro,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Cubed3,60,While MXGP Pro is mostly an attractive enjoyable experience that represents the sport quite well even avid fans should ponder long and hard over its longstanding flaws before indulging.
Chasing Aurora,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Broken Rules,Action | General | Flight | Flight,Eurogamer Portugal,60,Chasing Aurora has a striking presentation thats why we felt a disappointment when discovered the lack of game modes. An opportunity to create a great game was missed.
Deadcore,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2017,Grip Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PlayStation Country,60,Deadcore is a game built for speed runners but people lusting after the fastest times will likely be hampered by the controls on the PlayStation 4. It is also a very hard game to learn and get good at this imposing difficulty will likely put many people off. However for £6.49 this is priced well and will offer some diversion just don’t expect to be playing this for months to come.
Sonic Heroes,PlayStation 2,Jan-27-2004,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Inside Gamer Online,60,Its also the closest the series has been to its roots in well over a decade.
Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness,GameCube,Sep-11-2002,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,TotalGames.net,53,All Kemco appears to have done is taken Tetris and turned it upside down. Oh and added a load of ‘cute’ egg characters too to brighten the whole thing up. Great.
Triple Play 2002,Xbox,Mar-18-2002,Pandemic Studios,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Sim,Electronic Gaming Monthly,47,This game cant even show a bunt without a glitchy flaw or two. [May 2002 p.114]
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PlayStation,Nov-15-2001,Argonaut Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameShark,58,Next-gen games notwithstanding HPs graphics are well below average. The textures are of the absolutely flat glued-to-the-wall variety theres tons of pixilation and everything is generally ugly.
Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open,Xbox,Nov-14-2001,Rockstar San Diego,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,TotalGames.net,55,A fast and fun arcade racer.
4x4 Evolution,PlayStation 2,Feb-26-2001,Terminal Reality,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,IGN,50,Not my cup of tea. But even if 4x4 Evo were my bag the gameplay itself is just not fun. The driving itself is slow jerky simplistic and mundane. Its dull. If it werent for the spectacularly lengthy career mode with its oogles of parts then the game would have received an even lower score.
Gunbird 2,Dreamcast,Nov-17-2000,Psikyo,Action | General,CNET Gamecenter,60,Because Gunbird 2 is such an insanely hard game casual gaming fans are warned to stay away. Only hard-core fans of the genre need apply.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD Ver.,PlayStation 3,Aug-21-2012,Capcom,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Destructoid,55,At $20 there are way better fighting games with way more polish for less money making JoJos Bizarre Adventure HD an incredibly hard sell. Given the rough edges it feels more as if Capcom is trying to play off of the hype from the upcoming new JoJos game which is currently in development rather than give a nod to a classic.
Sid Meier's Pirates!,Wii,Sep-28-2010,Virtuos,Strategy | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,60,Pirates! is a light-hearted diversion. Its a game that you can invest time in casually without any real concern for forgetting what you were doing or losing your place. However the Wii port added control issues to a game that has a need for tight controls therefore its hard to recommend Pirates! for Wii.
SimCity,PC,Mar-5-2013,Maxis,Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,Worth Playing,55,Theres just something disturbing in seeing a game that is part of such a storied and influential franchise sacrifice so much to rush headlong into the social sphere. Perhaps the bugs and shortcomings will be resolved in a few weeks but until then SimCitys hidden requirement of additional patience still applies.
Gods Will Be Watching,PC,Jul-24-2014,Devolver Digital,Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,games(TM),50,The goalposts are moved without warning. [Sept 2014 p.127]
Planet of the Eyes,Xbox One,Sep-12-2017,Coco Cucumber | Cococucumber,Action | Platformer | 2D,Generación Xbox,60,Planet of the Eyes is the typical game that points out good manners but then lets itself be dragged by the ballast of (in this particular case) a ridiculous duration. His resemblance to other classic platform games doesnt give him a special charisma either although fans of the genre will forgive him.
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,PC,Oct-3-2012,Arkedo Studio,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gameplanet,60,More attention to actual gameplay would have elevated Hell Yeah! beyond a mere distraction and as such its difficult to see it as a break-out success and even harder to recommend to platform fanatics looking for something new.
Of Orcs and Men,Xbox 360,Oct-24-2012,Cyanide | Spiders,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG | Western-Style,AusGamers,56,Combine the linear environments combat mechanics and cut-scenes and it feels more like watching an animated show or even reading a book about it all. If you can get past all this and even find the right stride with the combat mechanics it does make for an interesting storyline and the game gradually expands slightly.
The Lord of the Rings: Tactics,PSP,Nov-8-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,GameSpy,60,A disappointing package that seems to have received even less development time than most of the PSP launch titles.
Musashi: Samurai Legend,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG,TotalPlayStation,55,Fancy graphics cant distract from the fact that this is a rather boring repetive game after a few hours. A shoddy framerate and unbalanced sound dont help matters either.
SpongeBob Squigglepants 3D,3DS,May-17-2011,WayForward,Miscellaneous | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,59,Spongebob doesnt have the personality to pull it all together. [Oct 2011 p.71]
Restaurant Empire II,PC,May-26-2009,Enlight Software,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Vandal,65,Despite some flaws and the fact it gets repetitive after a while the game manages to bring some freshness to the management strategy game genre.
Disney*Pixar WALL-E,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Heavy Iron Studios | Savage Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Game Chronicles,48,Too bad a game this boring and frustrating ever saw the light of day.
Hardwood Hearts,Xbox 360,Dec-8-2005,Silver Creek Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Board / Card Game | Gambling,Talk Xbox,59,Plain visuals repetitive audio and straightforward gameplay make up this title’s feature list. Hearts fans will of course enjoy playing online but most can be content with the Hearts game included with Windows XP saving their 400 MS Points for something else.
SIMULACRA,Switch,Dec-3-2019,Kaigan Games OU,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,FNintendo,60,SIMULACRA does not play like the greatest work ever made but that doesnt mean theres nothing to draw from this mystery FMV adventure. While the gameplay feels rather shallow the plot is compelling enough to keep the players entertained and involved with the hints and twists that are found along the way and the feeling of satisfaction when coming across a clue or reaching a different ending do help SIMULACRA to have some merit of its own.
Snooker 19,PlayStation 4,Apr-16-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,A PlayStation comeback that’s welcome yet undercooked almost as though it was released three months too early. Keep track of patches and rejudge in August. [Issue#163 p.87]
The Council - Episode 5: Checkmate,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,60,The daemonic theme took over far too much of the story’s focus. When coupled with technical issues it has reinforced that The Council has lost potential written all over it. Despite the many negatives there are positives to take away from the experience. Gameplay is engaging from start to finish with its RPG mechanics reinventing an episodic experience. Big Bad’s multiple endings offer plenty of reason to revisit not only Checkmate but also the first four episodes and see the different outcome from making a major choice. Once the finale is all done and dusted either the player or Big Bad will utter one simple word depending on the final outcome of the story. That word is none other than checkmate.
Grand Ages: Medieval,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2015,Gaming Minds Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General,games(TM),60,A fine option for those on PS4 craving more strategy. [Issue#167 p.93]
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,VideoGamer,60,WRC 2 is a minor improvement on last years game but that isnt good enough. Other than the official WRC license all the game has going for it is a decent (but not brilliant) driving model. Everything else here feels dated and pales in comparison to numerous other games in the genre.
Alien Breed 3: Descent,PC,Nov-17-2010,Team17,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC PowerPlay,60,Better options available but not a write-off. [Feb 2011 p.67]
Kholat,PC,Jun-9-2015,IMGN.PRO,Fantasy | Adventure | 3D | First-Person,games(TM),50,Visually stunning but a slog to play through. [Issue#164 p.90]
Sid Meier's Starships,PC,Mar-12-2015,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Game Over Online,55,There are lots of things Starships does poorly but at least as far as I’m concerned the lack of meaningful tech tree and shallow starship construction really don’t suffice in a game that after all has Starships in the title.
Infliction: Extended Cut,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2020,Caustic Reality,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,COGconnected,60,What sort of horror game puts you to sleep? One that doesn’t try anything new. And that’s what Infliction is. I can’t stress enough that it isn’t the technical side of the game that I don’t like – I think a lot of what’s there is well done with the budget they had. The lighting is good some of (not all) the voice acting is strong and the sound design is solid. But it’s the lack of innovation in storytelling and mechanics that throw me off. It’s frustrating too because ideas like the Polaroid camera and Cooking With Masimo show me that this team is capable of coming up with some genuinely fun stuff. But until then I guess we’ll just be afflicted by Infliction.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,PC,Jun-30-2009,EA Bright Light,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Absolute Games,60,Get ready to fly on brooms mix reagents in a pot and swing the magic wand… Until you yawn.
Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species,PC,Oct-19-2005,Blue Fang Games,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Computer and Video Games,65,If you enjoy squandering time away on the original title youre bound to find more joy and excitement from the additional animals and buildings included in this expansion.
Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight,PlayStation 4,Jul-7-2017,Artdink,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Eurogamer Italy,60,Accel World VS Sword Art Online is a good title for fans of the virtual worlds created by Reki Kawahara. However the game does not improve on the previous SAO games and the narrative fusion of the two universes feels sometimes forced.
Star Soldier R,Wii,May-19-2008,Hudson Soft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Nintendo Gamer,53,Very poor value for money. [JPN Import; June 2008 p.68]
Yosumin! LIVE,Xbox 360,May-27-2009,Square Enix,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Destructoid,60,Its a very casual puzzle-like game that can slowly sneak up on you with a hidden complexity. It will not be fun for all players and even fans of the puzzle genre may be left scratching their heads.
SingStar ABBA,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2008,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,TotalPlayStation,60,Clearly directed at one specific audience SingStar ABBA if nothing else will satisfy hardcore fans of the series. Everyone else? Eh not so much.
Call of Duty: Roads to Victory,PSP,Mar-13-2007,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PALGN,60,A valiant effort for what it is but still falls short in terms of control and level design. But if you absolutely must have your World War II fix on the go you could do worse.
Wheelman,Xbox 360,Mar-24-2009,Tigon | Midway Studios - Newcastle,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Level7.nu,60,If you mix together gameplay elements from Driver Grand Theft Auto Burnout and then throw some Vin Diesel in there the result is The Wheelman. An action filled experience where driving cars actually offers an entertaining experience during the somewhat repetitive missions. There is a total lack of storytelling in the game and the sequences on foot are quite mediocre but if you can look past this youll be treated to a decent action experience.
Wavey The Rocket,PC,May-7-2020,UpperRoom Games Ltd,Action | General,Eurogamer Italy,60,Wavey The Rocket is a new 3D side-scrolling arcade game based on a little fast rocket riding on a side curve. Despite its original gameplay this game is not suitable for all players.
Danger Zone,PlayStation 4,May-30-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,GameSpew,50,If you are craving that Burnout action but can’t be arsed to pull out an old console then sure Danger Zone will at least remind you of those glory days. Unfortunately it’ll do little else.
Redeemer,PC,Aug-1-2017,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,GameSpew,60,Initially I was really taken with Redeemer. The violent action slick controls and impressive visuals made a great first impression. After three hours of play however it became a slog to work through.
STRAFE,PC,May-9-2017,Pixel Titans,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PCGamesN,60,The sad reality is Strafe exasperates as much as it exhilarates. For every fleet footed show of sharp shooting it conspires to blast itself in the food with devious tactics and a steady slew of quite ‘fuuuuu!’ moments to players brave enough to endure the onslaught. There’s a really solid often graceful FPS in here one beefed up with generous side content – the 10 room horde mode-esque Murderzone and online speedruns break up the crushing campaign. Yet ultimately you can’t quite outflank Strafe’s unfair overwhelming slaughter.
Townsmen: A Kingdom Rebuilt,Switch,Nov-9-2018,HandyGames,Strategy | General | Management | Government,Digitally Downloaded,50,Over and over again some truly baffling decisions let it down and while the scenarios justify the asking price in themselves for any of us that prefer the sandbox mode of the simulations that we play Townsmen is a complete misfire.
The Town of Light,PC,Feb-26-2016,LKA,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Everyeye.it,60,Despite the very quick playthrough (around 3 hrs) he plot looses momentum halfway through and the pace slows down the progression. The idea is sound but the execution deserved more care.
X-Men: The Arcade Game,PlayStation 3,Dec-14-2010,Konami,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Play UK,60,Expensive but worth it for nostalgic thrills. [Issue#203 p.98]
Van Helsing,PlayStation 2,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,AceGamez,60,A second rate clone of Devil May Cry and if youre looking for that youd be better off with Devil May Cry 2.
Mace Griffin Bounty Hunter,Xbox,Jun-20-2003,Warthog,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Electronic Gaming Monthly,52,Its tough to overlook its frequent pauses for loading brain-dead enemies unrealistic animations and repetitive graphics. [Aug 2003 p.122]
Global Touring Challenge: Africa,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2002,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,GamePro,60,Although each car handles differently the off-road speedsters are extremely loose which makes for perfecting turns a frustrating task.
WWE WrestleMania X8,GameCube,Jun-9-2002,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Total Video Games,50,This game is rushed and it truly shows in every aspect. I feel as if I’ve been taken back to the days of WCW Nitro and the likes. Please get me out of this Nightmare.
Forever Kingdom,PlayStation 2,Jan-21-2002,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PSM Magazine,60,Just doesnt quite provide enough bang for your buck. [Iss #54 Jan 2002]
Floigan Bros. Episode 1,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2001,Visual Concepts,Action | General,GameSpot,52,There are hints of inspiration throughout with the game sporting some good-looking visuals a catchy soundtrack and a distinct sense of style. But the games length uneven gameplay and atrocious camera negate these virtues.
Gradius III and IV,PlayStation 2,Nov-13-2000,KCET,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,CNET Gamecenter,60,The good news if youre a hard-core old-school gamer is that they both play like the Gradius shooters of old. The bad news for every other gamer out there is that Gradius III and IV dont showcase the true power of the PS2.
We Happy Few,Xbox One,Aug-10-2018,Compulsion Games,Action Adventure | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Theres a general technical ropiness. [Nov 2018 p.80]
Micro Machines V4,PlayStation 2,Jun-27-2006,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Arcade,VideoGamer,50,As a harmless game for kids to play together Micro Machines V4 serves its purpose but a bit of flair and a larger scope could have made it the ultimate party racing game.
Legend of Kay Anniversary,PC,Jul-27-2015,Neon Studios | Kaiko,Action Adventure | General | Linear,Multiplayer.it,60,Legend of Kay Anniversary is a decent remaster of a not-so-brilliant action adventure game.
Major League Baseball 2K9,Xbox 360,Mar-3-2009,2K Sports,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,AceGamez,60,Major League Baseball 2K9 isnt a terrible game but it isnt a good one.
Party Hard,PC,Aug-25-2015,Pinokl Games,Action | General,Destructoid,60,Despite owing a lot to Hotline Miami in terms of sight and sound Party Hard is almost the antithesis of its most obvious influence. On a personal note its actually more reminiscent of How to be a Complete Bastard a similar (and ancient) game involving house parties and a destructive protagonist.
BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II,3DS,May-31-2011,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,XGN,60,This game has its own style and it has got a lot of options. But the truth is that there are better fighting games for sale for the 3DS.
Disgaea Infinite,PSP,Jun-8-2010,Nippon Ichi Software,Adventure | General | General | Visual Novel,Cheat Code Central,60,Although each playthrough will only take an hour or so if you want to experience all of the different paths as well as the games 13 endings you will need a good six hours or so. Just be prepared for a lot of repetition.
RiME,Switch,Nov-14-2017,Tantalus | Tequila Works,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,GamePro Germany,59,Quotation forthcoming.
Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix,Switch,Nov-8-2018,RideonJapan |Inc.,Action | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,FNintendo,50,Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix falls into an ungrateful position. While there is nothing particularly bad about this game it never manages to go so far as to stand out amidst its peers. Despite its good-looking artwork this is a mostly generic effort when it comes to plot and dialogues and with a gameplay that has too many clichés and which does not add an in-depth dimension to the experience.
Batman: The Telltale Series,PC,Aug-2-2016,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Game Over Online,56,About the only nice thing I can say about Batman is that it’s short. It only took me about eight hours to complete the game’s five episodes and I was happy when it was over. So obviously I don’t recommend this game to anyone for any reason unless you’re an obstinate fan of the Dark Knight.
Alien Breed,PlayStation Vita,Feb-12-2013,Team17,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Games Master UK,52,The ability to switch between classic and HD visuals is a brief curiosity but nothing more. [May 2013 p.81]
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight,PC,Mar-16-2010,EA LA,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpy,50,Straight fights in C&C4 play a lot like a boxing match between two guys with iron jaws and teensy weensy hands. You and your opponent can pound away at each other till youre both spent like an addicts last dollar but nobodys knocking anybody out.
The Saga of Ryzom,PC,Sep-20-2004,Nevrax,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Computer Gaming World,60,The only thing missing from Ryzoms customizable battling harvesting and crafting systems is a lack of bothersome bugs. [Jan 2005 p.102]
Mad Riders,Xbox 360,May-30-2012,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,ZTGD,60,Mad Riders is not a bad game just an unfortunate one. Naild is now in the bargain bin along with some of the older MX vs. ATV games and they are much better. This feels like a stripped down version of Naild and one that is not nearly as entertaining. The lack of diversity and progression are disappointing and the stiff controls dont lend themselves well to this type of game. If you want an off-road racer for your console there are a lot of other better choices out there.
Need for Speed Undercover,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2008,EA Vancouver,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Thunderbolt,60,A disappointing title. It doesn’t build on the series in any way basically sticking to Most Wanted’s fundamentals whilst adding more technical issues.
Warframe,PlayStation 4,Nov-12-2013,Digital Extremes,General | General | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gameblog.fr,60,Warframe is a good free-to-play TPS but the action is too repetitive to make it an essential.
Ghostbusters: The Video Game,PlayStation 2,Jun-16-2009,War Drum Studios,Action | General,Gameplayer Sweden,50,There is really no argument in favor of Ghostbusters on the Playstation 2. The story follows that of its more talented brothers (Xbox 360 and Playstation 3) and the content offers no major news.
Phantasy Star Universe,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2006,Sonic Team,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Jolt Online Gaming UK,60,The single-player is a fun new addition but is plagued by frustrating design choices and idiotic AI while the multiplayer is very hard to justify paying £6.99 a month for especially as the game doesnt even come with a free trial period.
Armored Core: For Answer,Xbox 360,Sep-16-2008,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,TeamXbox,61,The cut scenes are gorgeous the mech design is cool the overall art style is kind of awesome… but the game itself isn’t really worth it.
The friends of Ringo Ishikawa,Switch,Apr-3-2019,yeo,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gameblog.fr,50,The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa is quite weak in its pure playful proposal but has a real personality that could well embark you if you are sensitive to this typical Japanese atmosphere carried by hip hop melodies and retro graphics successful in this small city free to live the existence often in slow motion of a rascal high school and his friends. In this again the fact of being able to play in a nomadic way with the Switch is a plus.
Seasons After Fall,PlayStation 4,May-16-2017,Swing Swing Submarine,Action | Platformer | 2D,DarkStation,60,Seasons After Fall has its share of issues but it has enough going for it that there is an audience out there that will gain some enjoyment from it. The games production values are top notch so if you can look past the games problematic level design and simplistic gameplay then you may find it to be a very serene and immersive experience. It is a shame that those issues exist though because the games mechanics show some terrific potential. There are scattered moments when all of the games elements -- its atmosphere its gameplay and its graphics -- come together to provide some memorable experiences. In the end though the story in Seasons After Fall is too vague and confusing to be satisfying and a games graphics and music can only carry it so far. There is more than enough art in this package but there is not enough game.
The Baconing,Xbox 360,Aug-31-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Action RPG | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Thunderbolt,60,The Baconings witty daft and fun but also doesnt do enough to improve on the faults of the previous entries in the series and in some cases pushes those issues to the forefront. The bacon is now well cooked and about to burn.
Vikings: Wolves of Midgard,Xbox One,Mar-28-2017,Games Farm,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameSpew,50,If you’ve worn out your Diablo disc Vikings: Wolves of Midgard may fill a tiny bit of the void but mostly its painful similarities yet numerous missteps will likely just frustrate you.
NASCAR: The Game 2013,PC,Jul-24-2013,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,Gamereactor Sweden,40,Despite a lot of content Nascar: The Game 2013 is lacking in almost every gameplay aspect. Please let someone more talented do the Nascar series in the future.
N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure,Xbox One,May-15-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Miscellaneous | Adventure | Puzzle | General | 3D | First-Person,Pure Xbox,50,Your mileage may vary depending on how much the story grabs you but most will find that the asking price here is too high for what you get.
Sea of Solitude,PC,Jul-5-2019,Electronic Arts | Jo-Mei Games,General | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,CGMagazine,55,A clearly personal story told in a bland repetitive 3D platformer with padded gameplay terrible voice acting and no subtlety.
Kholat,PlayStation 4,Mar-8-2016,IMGN.PRO,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Everyeye.it,62,Its partly a walking simulator but the gameplay delivers some unexpected turns. The young development team clearly lacks experience but its still a promising first step.
The Crew,Xbox One,Dec-2-2014,Ubisoft Reflections | Ivory Tower,GT / Street | Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | Automobile,Eurogamer Germany,60,A lot of The Crew seems hardly thought-out almost chaotic but there is still a lot of good hidden underneath these problems.
Tiger Woods PGA Tour,DS,Dec-14-2004,Sensory Sweep,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Sim | Sim,IGN,60,The attempt to offer a unique touch-screen swing mechanic is definitely respectable but the first-time solution doesnt work nearly as well or offer as much control as it could have.
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,The Sydney Morning Herald,60,Aussie expertise has produced the best Spyro game in many years but the action gets repetitive and some old fans might be dismayed by the emphasis on combat.
Academy of Champions: Soccer,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,Nintendo Life,60,If you’re really after a quick knockabout and want to take up your only chance to play as Altair and Jade on Wii you’ll find some enjoyment in Academy of Champions but be prepared for plenty of frustration mixed in with your pie and Bovril.
Moons of Madness,Xbox One,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,ZTGD,55,In the end I think Moons of Madness is an ok game that could have used a little more fine tuning with both the story and the horror/survival mechanics. I would never say this is a bad game by any means but it is most certainly a forgettable one. I feel like I have seen something like this before in multiple other games and remember them much more than I did this one. At the same time if you’re looking for a horror game that has some interesting mechanics at times and some decent atmosphere I would at least wait for a price drop but would consider this if you haven’t tried it.
Sleep Tight,Switch,Jul-26-2018,We Are Fuzzy,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameSpew,50,While it certainly has its moments as an engaging shooter Sleep Tight might be better being slept through.
Disney/Pixar Ratatouille,PSP,Jun-26-2007,Locomotive Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GamesRadar+,60,Essentially the game is an underwhelming experience that unlike the film is ultimately forgettable.
Batman Begins,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2005,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Pelit (Finland),60,Could anyone take less risks designing a license action-adventure? Nice graphics and sound but super simplistic gameplay. Also super boring. [Sept. 05]
Carve,Xbox,Feb-24-2004,Argonaut Games,Driving | Racing | Snow / Water,Play Magazine,58,Carves saving grace is its online multiplayer handset-compatible team-based play. [May 2004 p.56]
Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction,Xbox,Jul-30-2003,Zono Inc.,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi,GMR Magazine,60,Uninspired level design rounds out the package with the designers relying far too much on impassable mountain ranges and forcing players to find roundabout routes to their targets. [Sept 2003 p.77]
X-Squad,PlayStation 2,Oct-23-2000,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,All Game Guide,50,As it stands it is an average action game that is bettered by a number of original PlayStation titles which is unacceptable.
Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault,PlayStation 3,Nov-27-2012,Insomniac Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Digital Spy,60,Enjoyable multiplayer modes are only worth so much when backed by a paltry single player campaign but taking the budget price tag into account we can think of worse Christmas stocking-fillers for fans of the series of the tower defense genre.
Yakuza: Dead Souls,PlayStation 3,Mar-13-2012,Ryu ga Gotoku Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Vandal,60,An interesting turn in the series but its gameplay is terribly designed in some parts and it lacks ambition and originality as a zombie game. We will pass a lot of time shooting and killing without no additional motivation or extra repeating the same scheme constantly. Only for hardcore fans of the Yakuza series.
ADR1FT,PC,Mar-28-2016,Three One Zero,Action | Action Adventure | General | Survival,CD-Action,55,The visuals are fantastic but I was disappointed with the shallow boring story and I grew annoyed with the gameplay. What upset me the most was the lack of scientific credibility in a game about scientists on a scientific space station (e.g. why do station modules separated by an explosion suddenly stop drifting apart!?). [06/2016 p.60]
Chaos Wars,PlayStation 2,May-30-2008,Idea Factory,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Hardcore Gamer,55,The grid-less combat can be annoying to get used to—especially when learning how to properly position characters—but there’s enough small changes to put a good spin on otherwise stale tactical combat.
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III,PC,May-22-2015,NeocoreGames,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Game Revolution,60,Anyone who follows this series will still be entertained with The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III but theyll ultimately be disappointed by the overly steamlined nature of this installment.
Super Lucky's Tale,Xbox One,Nov-7-2017,Playful Corp.,2D | Action | Platformer | 3D,3DJuegos,60,There is some magic in its world but Super Lucky’s Tale has some serious gameplay and camera problems.
Cold War,PC,Sep-27-2005,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Worth Playing,62,Unfortunately as imaginative as the X-ray camera and creative gadgets are they simply cannot make up for Cold Wars countless missteps
Snooker 19,Switch,Aug-23-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Switch Player,50,Snooker 19 is a decent snooker game but a poor entry into any other category. Dated graphics and finicky controls make this hard to recommend.
Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs. Sasuke,DS,Nov-12-2010,Takara Tomy,Action | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gameblog.fr,60,As an action platformer Naruto VS Sasuke is a fair and nice game to play. Its greatest flaw is the amount of similar titles on the DS to which it doesnt offer anything new. If youre an unconditional fan youll still find a well crafted game but if youre used to playing Naruto games on the DS this may be a waste of time and money.
Officers,PC,Jul-14-2009,3A Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,PC Zone UK,60,Officially generic. [Oct 2009 p.70]
Zombie Driver HD,Xbox 360,Oct-17-2012,EXOR Studios,Action | General | General,Thunderbolt,60,The problem is that the single-player package stretches the pretty basic gameplay worryingly thin and leaderboard competition can only keep you interested for so long. If youre looking for a decent arcade romp you could do a lot worse than pick up Zombie Driver HD. Its just that you could do a lot better too.
Crash Twinsanity,PlayStation 2,Sep-28-2004,Traveller's Tales,Action | Platformer | 3D,Game Revolution,58,A decent game and offers a few neat tweaks to its classic formula but in general does very little to break the mold of its predecessors.
MX vs. ATV All Out: Anniversary Edition,Xbox One,Feb-26-2019,THQ Nordic,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,ZTGD,55,When it’s all said and done MX Vs. ATV: All Out is an ok racing game. There’s a few issues here and there with the physics that could get to me and the fact that if I crashed it pretty much meant a last place finish for me but I can commend the game for improving from their previous outing with Supercross. I pretty much disliked that game while this one has some tweaks to the controls and enough content to keep me trying it out. Obviously only motocross fans should apply here and with the cheaper price the extra DLC players can find some enjoyment here.
Darksiders III,PlayStation 4,Nov-27-2018,Gunfire Games | THQ Nordic,Action Adventure | Open-World,Critical Hit,60,Beneath the mountain of bugs shoddy design and inconsistent performance there’s a genuinely good adventure waiting to be experienced in Darksiders III. Unfortunately its numerous problems are more than just annoying in nature. They’re quite simply…apocalyptic.
RymdResa,PC,Aug-20-2015,Morgondag,Role-Playing | General,Twinfinite,60,It’s pretty minimal in its design difficult to get into and a bit cumbersome to navigate. I’ll freely admit that on my first few plays I planned on giving it a pretty low score. As I played a bit more though it began to grow on me and the frustration faded as I learned pilot manage resources and make use of upgrades and consumables.
Hydrophobia: Prophecy,PC,May-9-2011,Dark Energy Digital,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameStar,56,The game lacks diversity. In each of the similar looking rooms youre doing the same thing. The less well done shooter elements and climbing passages cant change that.
Intellivision Lives!,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2003,Realtime Associates,Miscellaneous | Compilation,GameSpy,60,Wisely priced at 20 bucks and its historical info alone makes it a must for anyone with an interest in video-game lore but not one of the included games is anything more than a mild curiosity.
Worms: Open Warfare,DS,Mar-22-2006,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Artillery,GameSpot,59,Clumsy controls rocky presentation and a dearth of gameplay options hinder Worms return to 2D on the DS.
Storm,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,EKO Software,Miscellaneous | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,60,Not the perfect mixture between Braid and Flower we were hoping for.
TNA iMPACT!,PlayStation 3,Sep-9-2008,Midway Studios - Los Angeles,Action | Sports | Fighting | Fighting | Individual | Wrestling | Combat | Wrestling,PlayStation Universe,60,A wasted opportunity in almost every conceivable manner.
RPG Maker Fes,3DS,Jun-27-2017,Jupiter Corporation | Kadokawa,Role-Playing | General,Gameblog.fr,60,Despite an inevitably cramped interface RPG Maker Fes is still a solid yet demanding game creation software all the more so without a proper - if not fun - tutorial. But neither portability nor simple online sharing system can make up for such restrictions concerning tools and content. These tend to limit or even format the end results. Considering the time they require and the DLC policy it would be wiser to invest in the massively more elaborate PC version.
nail'd,Xbox 360,Nov-30-2010,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GameShark,58,Naild works just fine as a mindless racing game with thin idiot-proof gameplay to tide you over when you dont feel like something substantial with a learning curve.
Killer Is Dead,PlayStation 3,Aug-27-2013,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PSX Extreme,54,Killer is Dead has a lot going for it. The foundation is there. But the positives are mired beneath a poor gameplay mechanic that makes even simple control a chore. The story isn’t allowed to shine due to simplistic writing and stereotypical characters the difficulty can be very erratic and too many deaths feel cheap and unfair.
Arc Rise Fantasia,Wii,Jul-27-2010,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,1UP,58,If youre one of those players who simply cant make do without a Tales-like RPG experience every few months Arc Rise Fantasia might have enough of what youre looking for. But for most players the game will simply be a flashback to the bad ol days of the mid-90s when shoestring localization budgets botched many an epic RPG adventure.
Exit DS,DS,Nov-5-2008,Moss,Action | Puzzle | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,60,Exit DS has some likeable aspects but the tedious control scheme keeps it from greatness.
Track Lab,PlayStation 4,Aug-21-2018,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,UploadVR,55,It’s certainly easy for basically anyone to craft a simple beat in Track Lab but someone looking for anything more advanced would be better spending their time in a program like GarageBand. For VR junkies the prospect of becoming a virtual DJ is certainly appealing but a game with pre-selected and popular song clips like Electronauts will be a lot more satisfying and a lot less time-consuming.
Rainbow Skies,PlayStation 4,Jun-26-2018,SideQuest Studios,Role-Playing | General,GameSpew,50,It certainly lacks the punch and awe of the more inspired RPGs of late and it shows the more you play.
King Oddball,Xbox One,Sep-9-2016,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Action,CGMagazine,55,King Oddball is a game that loses its luster really quickly. What could have been a surprisingly clever play on the Angry Birds formula ends up being a dull affair by its lack of variety weak level design or replayability.
Thor: God of Thunder,DS,May-3-2011,WayForward,Action | General | General,The A.V. Club,58,There are inspired moments here especially in the games boss fights-the final two involve multi-jointed sprites spanning both screens-but theyre few and far between.
Cranium Kabookii,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Cubed3,60,Cranium Kabookii is definitely a fun little product for Wii with lots of variety involved and clever puzzles. Sadly there are a few niggles that prevent this from being a must-buy especially given how the board game itself is a much cheaper alternative.
Star Trek: Tactical Assault,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,G4 TV,60,Despite issues with the feel of the ship controls and combat there’s enough depth and gameplay modes to make it worth a look. The game looks fantastic and with so many ships battles and options to play with there’s more good than bad here.
Avatar: The Last Airbender,DS,Oct-10-2006,TOSE,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamePro,60,The game is obviously aimed at children who will most likely eat this one up like it was sweet sweet candy. Adults however will find it about as appetizing as steamed cauliflower and should definitely avoid it as such.
Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue,GameCube,Aug-16-2005,Xpec,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Gaming Age,58,While the basic gameplay concepts are put to good use poor design muddies what potential there was. If youre a die-hard Sanrio fan though this is definitely worth a playthrough.
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,PC,Nov-10-2004,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Warcry,60,The console versions have more variety in level design more distinct roles for each of the children and a longer play time. Heck I could finish the PC version in less time than it would take to watch the movie.
Wrath Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Feb-10-2004,Double Helix Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Boomtown,50,While it may be a fun little jaunt with the appearance of a clever strategy/action game if you attempt to play it that way you soon find out that it is fundamentally broken. A lesson from history one hopes.
RoadKill,GameCube,Oct-30-2003,Terminal Reality,Driving | Car Combat,GameNow,50,This game does nothing new except offer a ton of foul language to get you in trouble with the rents. Next please.
Pro Rally,GameCube,Nov-11-2002,Ubisoft,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,IGN,64,With a focus on being more accessible and arcadey its pretty easy to jump into for beginners; however for rally experts it may proof too basic to be worth any interest.
Superman: Shadow of Apokolips,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2002,Atari,Action Adventure | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,59,Sadly Shadow Of Apokolips just isn’t adventurous enough and offers little new or fun to both the Superman fan and game fan alike. More games like this and he could find himself back in the grave.
Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates,Game Boy Advance,Apr-30-2002,RFX Interactive,Action | Platformer | 2D,All Game Guide,60,For young dinosaur enthusiasts it would be an appropriate choice as its based on a peaceful premise and contains no graphic content or gore.
Wild Wild Racing,PlayStation 2,Oct-25-2000,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,GameSpot,60,Lacks any real punch and stands as the quintessential middle-of-the-road off-roading game.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood,PlayStation 4,Jul-26-2019,MachineGames,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,VGC,60,New Colossus fans will probably dislike its unfocused narrative and fussy levelling system but Youngblood offers plenty of blood and thunder if you give it time.
Juiced,PC,Jun-13-2005,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Yahoo!,60,The simple truth is that Juiced is behind the curve. The racing isnt bad but the game places emphasis on the wrong reward system.
The Adventures of Tintin: The Game,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2011,Ubisoft Montpellier,Adventure | General | General,Digital Spy,60,Ubisoft Montreal has paid close attention to both the Tintin licence and its target market meaning the game actually just about works. The action is hugely linear and the level design basic yet the campaign is also engaging to play through mixing platforming combat and vehicle sections in a reasonably decent narrative.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,PC,Jun-25-2007,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer UK,51,Hacky port that bleongs on consoles. [Sept 2007 p.80]
Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2011,Vicious Cycle,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer.nl,50,Fair is fair Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon is a game of below average quality. But because it doesnt pretend to be anything more than that well let that slide. But even for a game in which simplism is the main attraction it still does too many things wrong. That makes EDF: Insect Armageddon entertaining for an hour or two (possibly longer in coöp) but the lack of any variation makes you want to put it down rather sooner than later.
Dead Island: Definitive Collection,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,Techland,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Push Square,60,Dead Island: Definitive Collection is by no means perfect but it still succeeds in providing you with a substantial slice of flawed but generally fine zombie slaying action. Despite offering a graphical upgrade though there may not be much here to lure in those who have played these titles before – especially seeing as no real changes have been made to the core gameplay and because newcomer Retro Revenge disappoints.
The Witch and the Hundred Knight: Revival Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,IGN Spain,55,An unnecessary remaster without proper new reasons to justify its existence.
198X,PC,Jun-20-2019,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,SpazioGames,64,The first episode of 198X is an homage to the best and most iconic arcade games of the 80s but tells a really trivial and generic story.
The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer,Xbox,Nov-1-2005,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamerFeed,60,The gameplay has its setbacks and doesnt really evolve but it still offers fun two-player beat-em-up action and has a better presentation than it deserves.
Suikoden IV,PlayStation 2,Jan-11-2005,KCET,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,eToychest,60,A disappointment on all ends. Failed potential seeps from every area and as the game drags on the realization that it doesnt get any better starts to sink in.
Supreme Ruler: Cold War,PC,Jul-19-2011,BattleGoat Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Multiplayer.it,60,Excellent simulation and storic research Cold War suffers some AI problem poor engine and inconsistent music and sound effects.
This Is the Police,PlayStation 4,Mar-22-2017,Weappy Studio,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life | Career,CGMagazine,60,This is the Police is simple but highly addictive if you have the time to dedicate becoming more invested in Jack Boyd and his personal chaotic life.
Neon Chrome,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gaming Age,50,In small doses it might work — which takes me back to that caveat above — but as a sit-down console experience Neon Chrome just feels a little lacking.
FIFA Street 2,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Games Radar,60,FIFA Street 2 just isnt much fun to play plain and simple. It wont gain many supporters from the soccer enthusiast set nor arcade sports fans. The multiplayer isnt even that great - shunning online completely.
Fallout 76: Wastelanders,PlayStation 4,Apr-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,IGN,60,The Wastelanders update at least solidifies Fallout 76 as something that’s worth recommending to series fans who are interested in multiplayer. The new storyline is great but not as easy to play with friends as it should be.
Super Bomberman R,Xbox One,Jun-12-2018,Konami,Puzzle | Action | Arcade,TheXboxHub,60,Super Bomberman R is just a bit of a non-starter. The lacklustre campaign is only good to hold your attention for so long and the modes that really matter are criminally held back by a low player count.
Cubemen 2,Wii U,Sep-4-2014,3 Sprockets,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | General | Defense,Eurogamer Portugal,50,Cubemen 2 is a game of strategy and action in real-time strong in content and with a satisfactory design. It has some flaws especially at the level of interaction and control of the camera. The better part of the game lies in the online experience if you manage to find other players to play with.
Necrovision,PC,May-18-2009,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Crazy as hell Necrovision brings a new perspective to the events of World War One. Strictly a linear action shooter excels with an unconventional set of weapons and frantic boss fights. Unfortunately the graphics dont match the extreme HW requirements. [Feb 2009]
Worms Forts: Under Siege,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,60,Any improvements to the fun factor given to a multiplayer game is mostly down to all humans suffering from the same level of confusion given by a game that could do with being more like worms and less like a squeaking game of Crossbows & Catapults. More annoying than fun and not funny.
Dirty Bomb,PC,Jun-1-2015,Splash Damage,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PC Invasion,50,Acceptable but could have been so much better. Dirty Bomb is hampered by free-to-play nagging small maps and too many uninspiring matches.
World Poker Tour,Xbox,Oct-18-2005,2K Sports,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,GamerFeed,60,Something couldve been done to spice up the presentation and the AI couldve used tightening to the point that it could barely breathe.
Moons of Madness,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,GamePro Germany,63,Quotation forthcoming.
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,LucasArts,Action | General | General,XGN,55,Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II unfortunately did not become what many people hoped. The graphics are beautiful but in almost all other areas the game fails to impress.
Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom,Xbox One,Apr-28-2017,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object,DarkStation,60,The visuals are bright and despite their overly rich nature the screens are easy to read. The character graphics can be awkward though and the voice acting is sadly pretty ho-hum with only a few voice actors doing a bit too many characters for their skill range. Nevertheless the numerous cut scenes enrich the experience. In the end Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom is not quite like your typical Artifex Mundi game for better or worse. While the story is intriguing and mostly succeeds in its ambiguity the game itself is a tad too simple.
Resident Evil 6,Xbox One,Mar-29-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,4Players.de,59,Of course it looks better than on the old gen consoles a few years back. But the conceptual and mechanical shortcomings are still evident. This serves as a warning in which direction Capcom shouldn’t go with the sequel.
Godzilla: Save the Earth,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Fighting | 3D,Game Informer,60,A monstrous letdown. [Dec 2004 p.165]
FIFA Street 3,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,59,This game may not appeal to a big percentage of soccer fans. Nevertheless it does provide a few good laughs albeit short-lived. It’s not a game I can see myself playing consistently.
Finding Nemo,Xbox,May-9-2003,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GMR Magazine,60,The visuals arent as impressive as the movies but the underwater aesthetic and various effects (currents bubbles steam) are pleasing to the eye. [Sept 2003 p.77]
InnerSpace,Switch,Jan-16-2018,PolyKnight Games,Simulation | Flight | Civilian,Digitally Downloaded,60,Despite moments of brilliance and an overall lovely aesthetic there are mechanics which seem to be at odds with each other and thus the game seems conflicted. One moment you’re slowly following an enormous glowing beast through an oceanic tunnel and the next you’re chaining drifts together to zip through tight caverns while breaking through cracked glass panes.
Dragon's Prophet,PC,Aug-13-2013,Runewaker Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy,MMORPG.com,53,I had such high hopes for Dragon’s Prophet. Everything about it sounds like so much fun on paper. But what we have is a clear case of a game that needs a lot more time in development before it should be taking money from anyone. This shouldn’t be an open beta and you shouldn’t be able to spend money in Auretia. I understand that SOE and Runewaker need to pay the bills but both parties would have been far better off letting the game take a little more time in closed beta to take in and react to feedback from its community. Dragon’s Prophet isn’t the worst game I’ve played this year but it could have been so much better. And that’s what’s really unfortunate.
NBA 09 The Inside,PlayStation 3,Oct-7-2008,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,DarkStation,60,Unless you are dying to check out The Life on NBA 09: The Inside you have better basketball choices this holiday season.
Shark Tale,PC,Sep-27-2004,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,PC Gamer,62,Do be advised that the game is shockingly short: If you were to pay it and watch the movie side-by-side itd be a toss-up as to which youd finish first. [Holiday 2004 p.93]
X-Men: Next Dimension,GameCube,Oct-15-2002,Exakt,Action | Fighting | 3D,Gaming Age,58,Outside of some lethargic controls there is definitely some fun to be had with this brawler.
Alpha Protocol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,Totally360,60,There are some really good things about this game. Unfortunately they are marred by other aspects of the game which are a technical mess.
Spectrobes,DS,Mar-6-2007,Jupiter Corporation,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Worth Playing,60,Spectrobes seems to fall short because of its monotonous method of collecting and the poorly designed battle system.
PixelJunk 4am,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Q-Games,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Music Maker | Music Maker | Application,XGN,55,PixelJunk 4AM should be seen as an instrument instead of a game. Unfortunately the Move-controller does not have too many options and thats why this is an instrument that will not be fun for too long. Its too bad you need other people to give you kudos and gamers will probably miss the traditional game elements which seems to be making PixelJunk 4AM simply not interesting enough.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India,PlayStation 4,Jan-13-2016,Ubisoft | Climax Studios,General | Action Adventure | Linear,PlayStation LifeStyle,60,If you’re a big fan of Assassin’s Creed or enjoyed ACC: China then you can pick this up without hesitation. It’s more of the same gameplay-wise but completely different story and setting-wise.
Airheart: Tales of Broken Wings,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2018,Blindflug Studios,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,COGconnected,58,With simple controls but somewhat awkward combat it has a lot going for it however Airheart lacks an explanation of crafting and the stakes for returning home are far too high making it too great of a punishment to be enjoyable.
DarkStar One: Broken Alliance,Xbox 360,Jul-13-2010,Gaming Minds Studios,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,GameWatcher,60,None of the single pieces of Darkstar are particularly shoddy (voicework aside) but mixed together they form an experience thats largely devoid of anything memorable but also one that remains hypnotically sedate until eventual boredom sets in.
Big Bumpin',Xbox 360,Nov-19-2006,Blitz Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Big Bumpin is a no frills arcade-style gaming at its purest. Bumpin is identical on Xbox and Xbox 360 but the 360 version looks dramatically better and offers online play. [Holiday 2006 p.78]
Citadel: Forged with Fire,Xbox One,Nov-1-2019,Blue Isle Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,ZTGD,55,I didn’t mind Citadel. It was the first of its style that I have ever actually played. I now realize the open world sandbox do whatever you want kind of games are not really for me but I can easily see fans of this genre can have some fun here even with the shallow quest system some clunky controls and the technical issues.
Dogos,Xbox One,Sep-7-2016,INTERNET URL S.A.,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,IGN Italia,60,Dogos tries to recreate the feeling that shrouded lates 80s coin-op cabinets adding to the recipe a pinch of contemporaneity. Sadly the result is a tasteless shootem up.
NBA 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2007,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Operation Sports,60,In the end it appears its going to be a long year on the bench for NBA 08.
Windlands,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,CGMagazine,60,This wonderful looking Spider-Man simulator in the sky doesnt live up to its full potential.
Major League Baseball 2K8,Wii,Mar-3-2008,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Cheat Code Central,54,At the end of the day if the Wii is all you have got then this a decent baseball game to pickup. Just dont expect it to be revolutionary or live up to the other versions.
The World Next Door,Switch,Mar-27-2019,Rose City Games,Action Adventure | General,Game Informer,60,Outside of the art style The World Next Door feels generic and doesn’t do enough to make the adventure feel exciting. I expected something to pay off in the long run whether it was the story my choices or time I spent with characters but I instead ended the game saying That’s it? It made me feel like I wasted my time getting to know this world and the people who inhabit it.
Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,PlayStation 4,Feb-24-2015,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,DarkZero,60,Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires feels eerily similar to Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires with all the characters from Dynasty Warriors 8 so if you played that game then you can probably skip this unimaginative release.
The Immortals of Terra: A Perry Rhodan Adventure,PC,Jul-3-2008,Braingame,Adventure | 3D | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person,GamingExcellence,55,Immortals is not a game that I would choose to play in order to relax or pass the time in the airport.
NBA Live 07,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2006,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Sim,Cheat Code Central,60,A severe disappointment to fans of the genre. While EA has added many of the features that were missing from last year’s offering there are still too many issues that need to be ironed out including the animations the flow the online gameplay and the challenge.
Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings,PSP,Jun-9-2009,Amaze Entertainment | Amaze,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,Absolute Games,58,This game is worth your while only if you take it as an interactive movie of sorts – somewhat shallow and anachronistic but with adventures and a couple of silly puzzles to boot.
Eragon,DS,Nov-14-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Action RPG | General | Fantasy | Beat-'Em-Up | Japanese-Style | 3D,Nintendojo,61,Eragon will take about six to seven hours to beat with little reason to go back and do it all again. The game looks fantastic despite being a run-of-the-mill action/adventure game.
Sniper Elite III,Xbox One,Jul-1-2014,Rebellion,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic,The Digital Fix,60,Sniper Elite III continues to evolve the series and it’s evident that Rebellion have attempted to open up the franchise offering more freedom. Unfortunately this comes at the cost of a pure sniping experience – something most will be looking for given the title.
Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines,PSP,Nov-17-2009,Griptonite Games,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Absolute Games,59,The game keeps with the spirit of the original Assassin’s Creed but fails to comply with the letter. Its technical flaws outweigh the artistic merits.
Penny-Punching Princess,Switch,Apr-3-2018,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,DarkZero,60,Truly Penny-Punching Princess feels more like an indie experiment than a full-fledged game and that’s totally fine. It’s fun at it’s core and the feeling of repetition can be kept at bay by playing in small bursts making it perfect for its target consoles – the Switch and the Vita. With that said I simply can’t recommend this title at the current price of almost a full triple-A game. I mean there are a bunch of incredible games on the e-shop that aren’t even half the price.
Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche,Switch,Apr-1-2020,WayForward,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,Comicbook.com,60,Catgirl Without Salad: Amuse Bouche is a delightful sugar rush of a game thats over far too quickly. Its a wildly funny game with gorgeous visuals and terrific voice-acting. Unfortunately the game is over far too soon and once the three levels have been cleared there just isnt much else to do. The game doesnt overstay its welcome and that helps the joke land in a way that few other games could pull off. As such many players will find that the games humor and style are well worth the $7.99 cost of admission but others might want to wait for Shantae and the Seven Sirens instead.
The Godfather II,PC,Apr-7-2009,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Adventure | Third-Person | Historic | Linear | Open-World | Modern,ActionTrip,58,EA had a chance to deliver a really cool game and to improve upon the sequel. They seemed to have failed on both fronts.
Bounty Hounds,PSP,Sep-13-2006,Xpec,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Edge Magazine,60,In the great crapshoot of Namco thirdperson action games it’s a better than average throw. [Nov 2006 p.92]
