Firewatch,Xbox One,Sep-21-2016,Campo Santo,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,IGN,93,It is among the very best of the first-person narrative genre and it reminds us what video game storytelling is capable of in the right hands. It’s a game I can see coming back to every year or two just to revisit its beautiful sights and memorable characters – just like a good book.
Battlefield 4,PlayStation 4,Nov-12-2013,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameTrailers,95,Battlefield 4 is stout entry to the series and a strong addition to the PlayStation 4 launch lineup.

Mass Effect 3: Special Edition,Wii U,Nov-13-2012,Straight Right,Action RPG | Role-Playing | Action RPG,Eurogamer Germany,100,It's not as special as the title suggests. But that doesn't make it any less – or more for that matter – of a brilliant game.
Castle Crashers,PlayStation 3,Aug-31-2010,The Behemoth,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,1UP,91,My enthusiasm for the XBLA release was initially tempered by busted online play which took months to correct but the PSN version luckily lacks significant issues. Lag occasionally pops up and I've encountered a couple of issues connecting to matches but by and large it works -- and aside from having three friends in your living room playing online is the best way to experience Castle Crashers.
Pokemon Pearl Version,DS,Apr-22-2007,Game Freak,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Trainer,AtomicGamer,93,There are a metric buttload of Pokemon to catch and you'll be hard pressed to finish everything this game offers in under 100 hours much less 150 or maybe even 200.
Blaster Master Zero II,Switch,Mar-20-2019,Inti Creates,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gaming Age,100,It’s a “blast” to play for those who want a great action game whether or not you’re a fan of retro games. But by now with so many retro inspired games on the eShop both this and the first Blaster Master stand at the top of the offerings as true must-haves.
Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light,Xbox 360,Aug-18-2010,Crystal Dynamics,Action | Action Adventure | Adventure | Shooter | General | General | Third-Person | Modern,Telegraph,100,You will rarely find a game that offers such phenomenal value for money even at full price I would wholeheartedly recommend it. It's an exciting reinvention for a heroine whose light has unfortunately faded in recent years; an exciting parade of action puzzling and exploration elegantly crafted with fresh direction all while retaining that familiar Tomb Raider ethos.
BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma Extend,PC,Mar-2-2016,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | 2D,Riot Pixels,95,The gods of fighting games love those who are strong and stylish and that’s what CPEX is all about.
SWAT 4,PC,Apr-5-2005,Irrational Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Computer Gaming World,100,Simply put SWAT 4 is just about the best tactical shooter available. Its outstandingly realistic and gripping play delivers everything a tac-sim fan craves. Now if you'll excuse me there are more perps in need of cuffing.
Midnight Club II,PlayStation 2,Apr-9-2003,Rockstar San Diego,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,PSX Nation,100,Polished online interface + incredible sense of speed (i.e. bikes out of hell!) + perfect arcade handling (wheelies anyone?) + plethora of modes to tinker with + no "GT3: A-Spec"-type customization or realistic physics = the best PS2 arcade racing ever made.
Aggressive Inline,Xbox,Jul-29-2002,Z-Axis | Ltd.,Sports | Alternative | Skating,GameZone,95,Exactly what extreme inline skate fans have been looking for and the game will not disappoint in any way. Terrific graphics massive environments and an exclusive extra level make this a Must-Have.

EverQuest,PC,Mar-16-1999,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Yahoo!,100,Ridiculously addictive. A hallmark of a good game is that it makes what would be mundane interesting. In EQ you can happily play for hours just trying to gain enough experience to get to the next level.
F-Zero X,Nintendo 64,Sep-30-1998,Nintendo,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,Gaming Age,96,The framerate and action more than makes up for the slightly less than average graphics. This is a title that no self-respecting N64 owner should pass up. Nintendo has created the first true N64 classic since Mario 64.
Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age,Switch,Apr-30-2019,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,NintendoWorldReport,100,The Spring of 2019 has been a wonderful stroll down memory lane of Square Enix glory and Final Fantasy XII is the high note it ends on. Featuring every quality-of-life improvement to date and the ability to play in handheld or on a television at a moment’s notice it’s an easy decision to call the Switch version the definitive experience. Final Fantasy XII may end up being the best of the franchise on Switch but with so many titles still available hopefully it won’t be the last.
Trials Evolution: Origin of Pain,Xbox 360,Oct-5-2012,RedLynx,Street | Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street,Gamestyle,100,It is DLC that adds more to an already amazing package and the fact RedLynx continue to add more themselves as well as more to allow users to build the ever increasing library is simply refreshing to see. At just 400 Microsoft Points this is one of the best value DLC bundles you can get. If you own Trials Evolution you must get this now. If you don't own Trials Evolution buy that and get this now.

Bravely Default,3DS,Feb-7-2014,Silicon Studio,Console-style RPG | Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,Quarter to Three,100,It sounds like a lot and it is but not in an overwhelming way but in a fantastic three in the morning I can’t stop playing this game kind of way. When it all comes together and you destroy a boss that gave you troubles just a few job levels ago it feels great.

DOOM,PlayStation 4,May-13-2016,id Software,Sci-Fi | Third-Person | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Telegraph,100,There were no doubts that Doom would play fast look stunning or be gory; the surprise is that Doom is as relevant smart and self-aware as it is; merging old ideas with new ones; injecting its near-flawless shooter mechanics into a campaign that’s impeccably refined hilariously dumb and fiendishly moreish.
Slay the Spire,Switch,Jun-6-2019,Mega Crit Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Card Battle,Nintendo Life,90,Slay the Spire is an endlessly addictive roguelike card-battler that’s a perfect fit for the Switch; a beautifully balanced game that’s arrived on Nintendo’s system with all the benefits of an extended period of Early Access on PC. Its combination of ferocious battles entertaining chance encounters and selection of three impressively different player characters make every run to the top a nerve-wracking and totally absorbing affair.
Far Cry Instincts,Xbox,Sep-27-2005,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,GamingTrend,97,With incredible graphics stellar gameplay and an engaging story Far Cry: Instincts stands proud as a testament to how good a game can be.

Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling,Switch,May-28-2020,Moonsprout Games,Action Adventure | General | Role-Playing | Action RPG,Pure Nintendo,100,So maybe Nintendo will never make a truly great Paper Mario ever again. Lucky for us Moonsprout Games may have cracked the chemistry of what many fans actually want from the series in Bug Fables. If you’re still mad about Sticker Star or you’re still reeling about Color Splash do yourself a favor and nab this masterpiece as soon as possible and see what all the buzz is about. Rest assured that even if Origami King turns out to be a dud 2020 will see at least one great game with Paper Mario mechanics…even if it doesn’t bear its name.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 4,Xbox One,Oct-12-2018,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Cheat Code Central,100,Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is a game that looks at the entire first-person shooter genre past and present takes all the best ideas and assembles them into what feels like the easiest to recommend shooter I have ever played. The only caveat to that recommendation is that some gamers will find themselves absolutely ignoring two thirds of what the game has to offer and that makes me wonder if a different model of monetization would have been better suited for what feels like a collection of three different games.
Paradigm,PC,Apr-5-2017,Jacob Janerka,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Adventure Gamers,100,Paradigm is a uniquely creative blend of art music and consistently humorous gameplay. It’s an absurdist adventure like no other and one that’s earned its place among the classics.

With a ton of missions to complete an entire planet to destroy and online modes that will have you sitting in front of your television for hours upon hours this game has it all. I know this has been said a ton of times before but it holds true for this game; if Red Faction: Guerrilla doesn't get your blood pumping check your pulse.
Final Fantasy X-2,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,SquareSoft,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Cheat Code Central,100,It's a quality production from start to finish always letting fans in on the joke and treats the FF universe with great respect and more importantly a sense of fun that is always present on both sides of the screen simultaneously. Your Diva's await...
Night in the Woods,Switch,Feb-1-2018,Infinite Fall,Action Adventure | Adventure | General,Switch Player,90,Night in the Woods is a special game and a must-have for the Switch in 2018.

Battlerite,PC,Nov-8-2017,Stunlock Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | MOBA,FANDOM,100,It’s amazing...In a sea of LOL imitators its refreshing to see so many smart design ideas on display here. Thanks to the game’s gleeful disregard of genre conventions Battlerite feels like something that few free to play games manage — refreshing and dynamic.
Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars,PC,Mar-26-2007,EA LA,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,100,The big difference is the technical move forward. Action is fluid special effects are pretty and the cutscenes are funny and entertaining. Even the in-game physics like building explosions and collapses are comparable to first person shooters.
Madden NFL 10,Xbox 360,Aug-14-2009,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Sim | Sim,ZTGD,94,A fantastic addition to the series and quite possibly the best football game ever created.
Batman: Arkham Knight,Xbox One,Jun-23-2015,Rocksteady Studios,General | Fantasy | Action Adventure | Open-World,Game Over Online,95,Batman: Arkham Knight closes out Rocksteady’s trilogy in a big way.

Assassin's Creed III,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Ubisoft Quebec,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Hardcore Gamer,100,The Wii U version of the title is practically the same as the other console versions but unlike Wii U ports that originally came out months ago it's possible that prospective buyers have still not purchased it. If that's the case the Wii U version is as fine option as any but those who have the game have absolutely no reason to buy it again. Still forgetting its a port Assassin's Creed III is the best game in the Wii U launch line-up and should be a must-buy for those yet to experience its incredible adventure.
Astro Boy: Omega Factor,Game Boy Advance,Aug-18-2004,Hitmaker,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Nintendojo,98,The difficulty goes up gradually and never catches you by surprise; you won't find any huge leaps in difficulty here. The graphics are fantastic and the color use is great.

Bit.Trip Presents...Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien,PC,Feb-26-2013,Gaijin Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Machinima,95,There are very few games I’d recommend to anyone regardless of gaming experience or preference but Runner 2 is one of them. It’s a fantastic reminder that sometimes games are most effective when they don’t try to emulate explosion-riddled Hollywood blockbusters and instead embrace solid gameplay mechanics and unfettered creativity.
Hotline Miami,PC,Oct-23-2012,Dennaton,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,Games.cz,100,Hotline Miami is proof that it is possible to create a fresh and addictive action game even with the game's emphasis on retro.

Out of the Park Baseball 13,PC,Apr-9-2012,Out Of The Park Developments,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Quarter to Three,100,For gamers out there like myself who cut their teeth on R.B.I. Baseball rather than Strat-O-Matic I highly recommend this as a supplemental experience to today's console baseball titles. It may just supplant them in your imagination as it's a platform to weave believable baseball tales of any stripe at whatever speed or level of control you desire.
NHL 2004,GameCube,Sep-22-2003,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,Play Magazine,100,Not to be outdone EA Sports has upped the ante with NHL 2004 and it truly has left me speechless.

Metal Slug X,PlayStation,Apr-14-2001,ProSoft,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Core Magazine,91,While essentially just a more difficult remix of "Metal Slug 2" Metal Slug X is still one of the finest 2D shoot-em-ups since the original "Contra."
Tropico,PC,Apr-5-2001,PopTop Software,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Real-Time | Management | Compilation | Modern | Modern | Government,Hot Games,100,It may be a bit heavy on the micro-management but if you’re at all interested in the God game genre you’ll be hooked on this game for a long time.

It's a game that everyone whether they’re big into sports video games or just can’t seem to get into them will really enjoy.
Dead or Alive 4,Xbox 360,Dec-29-2005,Team Ninja,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GamePro,100,If looks could kill DOA4 would be called Murderer's Row. This game is beautiful; even while you're beating the tar out of your opponent you'll notice that your surroundings are among the finest you've seen in any fighting game... Hands down the best installment in the series. [Jan 2006 p.38]
NASCAR SimRacing,PC,Feb-15-2005,EA Tiburon,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Stock Car | Stock Car | Automobile,Gaming Age,100,Game play is a godsend for fans of the Cup as NASCAR Sim Racing is exactly what it states…it is sim racing. While some newbies to the sport or gamers who prefer arcade style action may be turned off by the relentless realism I say it is better to sacrifice the weaker links in favor of the hardcore fans that make this sport what it is today.
Devotion,PC,Feb-19-2019,Red Candle Games,Action Adventure | Survival,IGN Japan,98,After delivering the cult-hit Detention Taiwanese developer Red Candle Games presents its next psychological horror adventure Devotion. While making the jump from 2D to 3D the superb presentation and storytelling remain intact. A 1980s Taiwanese condo is faithfully recreated in 3D to the extent that you can almost detect the odour.

Crysis 2,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Crytek,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,D+PAD Magazine,100,This is not COD with an afterthought of a campaign nor is it Far Cry 2 with its open expanses and sand-box gameplay. It's not a corridor shooter like Doom and it isn't Battlefield or Killzone 3. This is Crysis 2 – a magnificent first-person experience in its own right that stands out from the crowd by focusing on a campaign that is wholly engaging at times highly challenging and often truly memorable.

This is the expansion we were hoping for. Nicalis did us a solid and stuffed a disgusting amount of content in a game already bursting with disgusting content. Now if you’ll excuse me I’m going to kill Mother for the thousandth time.
Hotline Miami,PlayStation Vita,Jun-25-2013,Abstraction Games | Dennaton,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,Gaming Age,100,And that to me is the essence of Hotline Miami: it's a game that does everything so perfectly it even makes me love stuff I would normally hate. Which means that if we're talking about stuff you'd normally love — extreme violence extreme difficulty druggy music — then this right here could end up being your favorite game of all time.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,PC,Sep-8-2010,Frictional Games,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameCritics,100,It was without a doubt one of the most difficult draining and stressful gaming experiences I have ever had but it's also an absolute masterpiece.

Fable,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Big Blue Box,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Gamestyle,100,Just remember Fable is not "Project Ego." What it is though is a redefinition for RPG's. It takes out all the frustrating elements of the genre and instead puts in a heap of fun options and possibilities. This is why; despite its disappointing conclusion Fable is one of the most gripping and enjoyable games that has come to grace the console scene.
Forza Horizon,Xbox 360,Oct-23-2012,PLAYGROUND | Playground Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Eurogamer Sweden,100,It's hard to find negative things to write about Forza Horizon.

Assassin's Creed Origins,Xbox One,Oct-27-2017,Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Open-World,GameSpew,100,With a stream of post-launch content bolstering what it is already an epic 50-hour-plus adventure Assassin’s Creed Origins is one of the most engrossing and awe-inspiring experiences of the year especially on Xbox One X where the visuals are pushed to the max.

Monster Train,PC,May-21-2020,Shiny Shoe,Strategy | Turn-Based | Card Battle,GameCritics,100,As far as deckbuilders go Monster Train is fantastic. The general strategy and the quirks of fighting on a multi-leveled train make it stand out as its own sort of unique puzzle that rewards players for cleverness. The runs are fast it’s easy to learn and the challenge modes give it plenty of depth and replay. Get on board before it leaves the station!

Assault Android Cactus,PlayStation 4,Mar-8-2016,Witch Beam,General | Scrolling | Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gaming Age,100,The one downside to a gorgeous fast-paced whirlwind of constant activity is that there's not much of a story to go along with it.

Persona 4 Arena Ultimax,Xbox 360,Sep-30-2014,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | 2D,IGN,91,Its irresistible sense of style speaks for itself but given how much I love its predecessor the biggest compliment I can pay it is that it’s 100% the sequel that Persona 4 Arena deserved.

He's such a great character and is very funny throughout the game especially in the way he deals with some of the side-quests that characters give him. If you already own the game there's very little incentive to picking up the Wii U version but if you've held off or never had the means to buy it until now I highly recommend the purchase.
Guitar Hero: Metallica,Wii,Mar-29-2009,Neversoft Entertainment,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Gaming Age,100,For fans of the Guitar Hero franchise Guitar Hero: Metallica might be the best entry we've seen yet. I was somewhat lukewarm on my reception to the other band-themed title that Neversoft put out with GH: Aerosmith but Metallica absolutely blows that game out of the water not only with the track listing but the overall time and attention put into the actual presentation and how the band seems to be infused into every aspect of the game.

It’s mitigated to a point by having you lose all your money before entering a castle and each purchased bonus makes all the others more expensive.
BattleBlock Theater,Xbox 360,Apr-3-2013,The Behemoth,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,GamingTrend,92,At 1200 MS points it’s a small price to pay for the madness and certainly lives up to its Castle Crashers pedigree for polish poise and preposterous premise.

Yakuza Kiwami 2,PlayStation 4,Aug-28-2018,Sega | Ryu ga Gotoku Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gaming Age,100,I really really enjoyed my time with Yakuza Kiwami 2 and as a fan of the series I’d certainly urge you to check it out. It has very few flaws outside of some minor animation issues and the occasional cumbersome combat sequence. It also feels like a much stronger remake than even Yakuza Kiwami which was no slouch to begin with.

Trials Rising,Xbox One,Feb-26-2019,RedLynx,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,XboxAddict,90,While new players will surely hit a wall of difficulty at some point it’s never unfair and simply requires you to learn the appropriate skills to overcome the hurdles. I’m so excited that Trials is back to where it once was and I wish I could count the times I’ve said “only one more try” repeatedly I just wish the loot boxes and microtransactions didn’t feel so tacked on.

Pyre,PlayStation 4,Jul-25-2017,Supergiant Games,Role-Playing | General,Gaming Age,100,I would highly suggest picking up Pyre at your earliest convenience. I absolutely believe it will be one of the best games you play all year and quite frankly I can’t think of another game that easily compares to it. The story mechanics and world featured absolutely stand-out compared to other releases this year and it’s well worth experiencing. And even if you’ve felt lukewarm on Bastion or Transistor Pyre is such a different experience that I’d still say it’s worth checking out whether you are a fan of Supergiant or not. But if you are then there is no reason to miss Pyre.
Tony Hawk's Underground 2,PC,Oct-4-2004,Neversoft Entertainment,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Warcry,95,There are so many places to go and things to do and cities to wreak havoc in why would you ever want to stop?
FIFA 17,PlayStation 4,Sep-27-2016,EA Sports | EA Vancouver,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Gaming Age,100,All I want is a great career mode. And as I said that's one area where FIFA 17 stands head and shoulders above its peers. I don't know if that means that it's toppled NBA 2K17 as the best sports game around but I think thanks to The Journey there's certainly a conversation to be had there.

Stepping into the world of Trine 2 is much like stepping into one of the great Walt Disney's fairy tales and shouldn't be missed.
inFamous,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Sucker Punch,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Open-World,Giant Bomb,100,It's the quality of the central action in InFamous that I keep coming back to. Everything else would be fancy window dressing if Sucker Punch hadn't nailed the basic gameplay elements the simple moving and shooting as precisely as it did. InFamous feels like a game designed from the very ground up to be fun to play so I guess it's no surprise that as soon as the credits finished rolling on my good version of Cole I started up an evil one to play it all over again.

Disgaea 4 Complete+,Switch,Oct-29-2019,Nippon Ichi Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,RPG Site,90,I wasn’t expecting to have this much fun with Disgaea 4 Complete. The story didn’t blow me away but the humorous dialogue and amazing cast go a long way. It’s still an incredibly addicting game with multiple endings and an insane amount of content. If you’ve already spent countless hours on the Vita version you might not find too much of a reason to grab Complete + but this is the definitive release of one HL of an SRPG. That’s all from me I’m off to go kill some more time in the Item-World now dood.

DiRT Rally 2.0,PC,Feb-26-2019,Codemasters,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Game Debate,90,I've really enjoyed every minute I've spent with Dirt Rally 2.0 just as I did with 1.0 before it.

Saints Row: The Third,PC,Nov-14-2011,Volition Inc.,Action Adventure | Modern | Modern | Open-World,ZTGD,93,Saints Row The Third surprised the heck out of me. The GTA comparisons are inevitable but they are vastly different games. While both hold a mirror up to reality the reflections are vastly different.

Saints Row has taken a flying leap off the roof of reality howling the F-bomb while chugging a licensed energy drink all the way down… and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Some players will lack the time or patience to put in the effort that any heavyweight role-playing game demands – this is a 50-hour adventure at least – but it puts forward an irresistible case for your attention. As video games are once again weathering ignorance-fuelled attacks that paint them as universally gun-centric violent and nihilistic Ni no Kuni is a timely counterpoint.
Project CARS 2,Xbox One,Sep-22-2017,Bandai Namco Games | Slightly Mad Studios,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,IGN,92,Project CARS 2 plays like a pumped-up version of the classic TOCA Race Driver 3 from 2006 redressing many of the complaints levelled at the original.

It’s serious but doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s emotionally compelling while never losing sight of the fact it’s also a game. It’s a popular and well-regarded game that for whatever reason people simply don’t talk about it enough. Hopefully with this PlayStation 4 release that will change.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11,Wii,Jun-8-2010,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Sim | Sim,GameShark,100,It still blows my mind that the most hardcore golfing experience in video games today is found on the console universally decried as being too "kiddie" but that is the stone cold truth.
The Movies,PC,Nov-8-2005,Lionhead Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Total Video Games,100,Most importantly the game’s gradual learning curve handy tutorials and simple interface is immediately accessible yet there’s still plenty to learn and discover when it comes to the subtleties of filmmaking 30 hours later.

The game looks amazing sounds amazing and plays like a dream. The singleplayer campaign was a satisfying 10 hours and left me wanting to play it again at a higher difficulty setting. Multiplayer borrows a few ideas from other games but overall is a unique and highly enjoyable experience even if it does force you to put in the time to get the most out of it.

SpaceChem,PC,Mar-2-2011,Zachtronics Industries,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Everyeye.it,90,Due to its extreme complexity SpaceChem will never be a title for everyone. Too deep and articulate for casual players it will be appreciated only by those who are willing to engage themselves with the deep game mechanics Nevertheless Spece chem is no doubt one of the most brilliant puzzle game in the history of videogames.
Viva Pinata,Xbox 360,Nov-9-2006,Rare Ltd.,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,XboxAddict,96,The most surprising part about Viva Piñata is that once you've gained higher levels of experience you keep them. Even if you start a new garden. Which means you carry over all you coins and all the items you've unlocked during the course of your previous gardens so you don't have to start that all over again. Killer!

Pokemon Ultra Sun,3DS,Nov-17-2017,Game Freak,Role-Playing | Trainer,Vooks,100,Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon represent everything Game Freak has worked towards in its 20 years of growing the Pokémon franchise. It has its flaws as every game does but they don't detract from the lively world incredible writing and sheer fun that the game provides. Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon are likely the last big games to be released on the 3DS and Game Freak sees the console out with a game that will be remembered as a shining example of what the series can do when at its best.

South Park: The Fractured But Whole,Xbox One,Oct-17-2017,Ubisoft San Francisco,Role-Playing | General,TrueAchievements,100,Housing a story that is both offensive yet hilarious ludicrous yet serious is a rare achievement but this game accomplishes it.

I knew within the first few minutes that it was going to be something truly special earning a place in my favourite games of all time.

Very few video games have made a true and permanent mark on my heart but If Found… has done just that

TimeSplitters: Future Perfect,PlayStation 2,Mar-21-2005,Free Radical Design,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,100,So say what you will about TimeSplitters being too arcadey or too cartoony or not serious enough—I'll just be over here having a hell of a time. Last I checked that's what games were for.

Valkyria Chronicles,Switch,Oct-16-2018,Sega,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Gaming Age,91,In terms of a great bargain it’s hard to get better than a game like Valkyria Chronicles and the quality of this port on the Switch means it’s a must-buy for anyone curious about the series or considering adding it to their Switch library. And the only thing that makes an SRPG better is the portability of having it around to make dull moments like bus rides and family events breeze on by.
Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment,Switch,Mar-3-2017,Yacht Club Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Digital Chumps,90,Ultimately there is very little bad to say about SoT. It’s an excellent 2D action platformer with some good RPG elements and its balanced difficulty lets genre hacks like me struggle through while more seasoned players can still expect a good but not overly difficult challenge. To be honest some of the early bosses proved harrowing for me but I liked that I could try going after the different knights out of order find checkpoints and have a lot of opportunities to continue at those checkpoints too. Much like the old games its inspired by it’s a tough but short and arguably more memorable than many of those older games. Additionally with New Game+ support for more nooks and crannies to explore as well as Feats and Challenges there’s a solid value here for $10. The only better value would be to get SoT via the Treasure Trove release instead.

Beyond Good & Evil HD,Xbox 360,Mar-2-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameOver.gr,100,It is not about the known camera issues that cause several headaches or the short story. It is not about what this game should be and what has become of it. Itʼs about the very essence of gaming the essence that draws a permanent smile on your face while playing this masterpiece!

High Heat Major League Baseball 2003,PlayStation 2,Feb-9-2002,3DO,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Sim,GamePro,100,Half of High Heat 2003's thrills come from its intuitive playable controls. Fielding and baserunning are a snap (though manual slides would have rocked) and the pitching/batting setup is one of the best ever.
Super Street Fighter II: Turbo Revival,Game Boy Advance,Oct-30-2001,Capcom,Action | Fighting | 2D,Hot Games,100,The graphics in this miniature version do the game perfect justice.

F1 2010,PlayStation 3,Sep-22-2010,Codemasters Birmingham,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Formula One | Formula One | Automobile,Gameblog.fr,100,Even though there are some mistakes here and there (let's say it's youth related) F1 2010 probably remains one of the best F1 racing games ever. It's reminiscent of the old Formula One on the original PlayStation and even better of the legendary F1 '97. But a thousand times more comprehensive and realistic. Its career mode grants it an enormous playtime expectancy and racing over the internet or against the clock is a delight best served with long evenings to fully enjoy it. Well that's it : F1 2010... what else ?
Maximo: Ghosts to Glory,PlayStation 2,Feb-11-2002,Capcom,Action | Platformer | 3D,Four Fat Chicks,100,Ghosts to Glory is one of the most addicting angering exciting and unforgiving-as-all-get-out (when jumping onto moving targets) games that I have ever played! There is never a dull moment.
BlazBlue: Central Fiction,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,90,BlazBlue really is gorgeous. Every character is animated in such a way that every movement they make reinforces their personalities. Every environment is a living breathing thing that sets a meaningful scene and helps build the world around the characters. Because everything is 2D and quite flat it’s easy to wish that all that storytelling and character building was funnelled into a more natural fit but then again with BlazBlue being such a successful franchise for so long now it’s hard to argue that the developers and producers are making a mistake.
Prey,Xbox One,May-5-2017,Arkane Studios,General | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Windows Central,100,Prey might not be the prettiest game but it's among the most atmospheric.

Sound Shapes,PlayStation Vita,Aug-7-2012,SCEA,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Gaming Age,100,Overall I found Sound Shapes to be an absolute joy to play with little to no complaints about the actual game itself.

Gears 5,Xbox One,Sep-6-2019,The Coalition,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,TheXboxHub,100,I have no hesitation in naming Gears 5 on Xbox One as a triumph. The story is amazing the multiplayer works perfectly and Horde and Escape are the cherries on the cake.

Topped off with a wealth of options that will keep you playing for hours on end and an addictive online mode Fight Night is just what the game's subtitle suggest...it's a Champion.
Resident Evil 5,PlayStation 3,Mar-13-2009,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),100,Perhaps Resident Evil 5's most remarkable achievement is how it deftly straddles the line between the franchise's sometimes endearing sometimes frustrating legacy gameplay mechanics while incorporating more contemporary action adventure elements like enhanced interaction and exploration of environments and a decidedly more shooter-like control scheme. [Mar 2009 p.38]
God of War: Origins Collection,PlayStation 3,Sep-13-2011,Ready at Dawn,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Gaming Age,100,With enhanced anti-aliased visuals running at 60 fps and 1080p both games on the PlayStation 3 look about as fantastic as you would expect them to when making the transition from a 480x272 pixel portable screen.
Salt and Sanctuary,PlayStation 4,Mar-15-2016,Ska Studios,Action | Platformer | 2D,LEVEL (Czech Republic),100,This tribute to Souls series is built on the proven mechanics but it extends them beyond the "original" universe. Thanks to jumping segments it offers a tougher challenge yet it is fair and fun as hell. [Issue#263]
Xenogears,PlayStation,Oct-20-1998,SquareSoft,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Games Domain,100,Combining good action dark drama a splash of anime and lots of Really Big Robots this game is the must-buy Playstation RPG of the season...

Tetris DS,DS,Mar-20-2006,Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking | Stacking,GamePro,100,Aside from an unresponsive touchscreen issue every now and then Tetris DS is an amazing puzzle package and is easily one of the best DS games to date - a perfect partner for the upcoming DS Lite.
Dark Souls Remastered,PlayStation 4,May-25-2018,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Guardian,100,If you want to visit Lordran and enjoy a straight-up bash-the-baddies quest then you’ll find no better collection of bosses than this. If a new kind of adventure appeals however one in which quick fingers matter less than brains and human cunning there’s still nothing like Dark Souls. After seven years its mystery has diminished but it’s still among the best of the best.
Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor,DS,Jun-23-2009,Atlus,Role-Playing | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,Worth Playing,93,Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor is easily one of the best strategy-RPGs on the Nintendo DS and may even be one of the better strategy RPGs ever made.
Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones,GameCube,Dec-1-2005,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,96,All of the game's elements mesh from the music to the storyline from the puzzles to the control system. I can't find anything nasty to say about this game. Ubisoft have certainly done their homework.

Sprint Vector,PC,Feb-2-2018,Survios,Racing | Arcade | Other,VRFocus,100,There’s very little to dislike in Sprint Vector. Sure there will be times when that competitive edge over takes you getting annoyed when you fudge a jump but that’s to be expected. The single-player has enough to get you started with a few hours of gameplay yet it’s the multiplayer that’ll have you coming back for more. Here’s hoping that Sprint Vector draws in enough of a crowd to sustain it rather than becoming another multiplayer focused experience that gets forgotten about. Which would be a shame because from where VRFocus is standing Sprint Vector is another hit for the studio.
Battlefield 3,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,Xbox World Australia,96,Every FPS game has its place but if you loved Battlefield 2 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 and sunk hours into the multiplayer of those games then be prepared to sink another few hundred hours into Battlefield 3.

Monster Hunter Tri,Wii,Apr-20-2010,Capcom,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Thunderbolt,100,Tri is one of those paradoxical titles that is by no means perfect but doesn’t deserve anything less than a ten out of ten rating when compared to everything else on the system.

The improvements and extra things brought to the Switch version make it the most complete and enjoyable way to play it (though the game is also available on PC and PS4). Any puzzle fan's library would be greatly improved with the addition of this game!
Steins;Gate 0,PlayStation Vita,Nov-29-2016,5pb,Adventure | Visual Novel,The Vita Lounge,100,They say you can't improve on perfection yet Steins;Gate 0 does just that. Taking what made the original story so great and adding new characters and a much darker theme makes Steins;Gate 0 the perfect continuation to a story that I though could not be improved upon - how wrong I was!
Assassin's Creed III,Xbox 360,Oct-30-2012,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Quarter to Three,100,No multiplayer game so cannily captures a feeling of cat and mouse and relies so completely on tension and suspense instead of yet more thrills.
