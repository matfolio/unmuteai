Call of Juarez: The Cartel,PlayStation 3,Jul-19-2011,Techland,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Modern | Arcade,XGN,45,Although Techland brings some nice ideas into the Call of Juarez universe the game ultimately fails to deliver because of a way too typical story dated graphics loads of bugs and a total misunderstanding of the concept Wild West. The Cartel is a major step back for the franchise and we would have been better off without it.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,XGN,40,Dead Horde is a game that is riddled with bugs that could have been easily prevented. Sure the graphics are good and the co-op is pretty fun but the gameplay gets very boring very fast.
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Giant Bomb,40,Unfortunately Mr. Driller Online is plagued by a meager selection of gameplay modes and bug-ridden online play that keep it from being worth the $10 price tag.
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,We Got This Covered,50,Infinity Runner for better and worse is a standard uneventful running game made for a console instead of a mobile device. It’s repetitive simplistic and meandering – but that may just be the diversion you’re seeking.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,IGN,45,This is the very definition of a budget racer and I dont mean that in a good way. Basic arcadey track designs mix with stupidly simple controls and poor graphics for an end experience that falls somewhere below the average.
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Jeuxvideo.com,45,Generation Zero stumbles on its own concept et never achieves to find balance between shooter and survival. Repetitive and dull it does have some ideas but they don’t have enough impact to hide all the flaws.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,GameSpot,44,Hard Truck: Apocalypse takes an interesting premise and strips away all but the most mundane elements leaving you to drive down a long and unexciting road to nowhere.
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,AceGamez,40,Hard Rock Casino is a poor game that could have been thoroughly enjoyable; however the lack of polish presentation and playability make this a game I simply cannot recommend. I like to make a bet every now and again but place your money on Hard Rock Casino and youre backing a guaranteed loser.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GamesRadar+,50,Its slow-paced combat and exploration weak visuals and plodding plot leave a lot to be desired.
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PSX-Sense.nl,45,A shooter with a lot of potential which turns out to be a soulless repetitive and boring husk of a game. Graphically it looks alright and shooting stuff up is fun for a while but youll soon be thinking about better things you could have been doing instead. The immersion is completely broken due to not being able to move around freely. While conceptually a great idea Bravo Teams execution falls short and that is a shame.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendojo,42,I wouldn’t say it was a mistake to bring Rodea to 3DS but the game is so rough that it either needed more time in development or the handheld was incapable of fully handling Naka’s vision. For fans of the creator’s previous works and players who enjoy 3D adventure titles Rodea is worth a look but be prepared to fight with it in order to get any enjoyment out of the game.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,GameZone,42,The biggest thing that make this game get such a low score is non-responsive controls and framerate issues will make you want to slam your precious PlayStation Portable against a brick wall.
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,XGP Gaming,43,Basically theres nothing to like about Catwoman outside of the graphics. At the very most the game deserves a rental.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameZone,55,There are so many bugs in this game that at times it is unplayable and futile to even attempt to do so.
Shadow the Hedgehog,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2005,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Jolt Online Gaming UK,41,Shadow the Hedgehog is awful. Stay away from it.
Crash: Mind Over Mutant,DS,Oct-7-2008,TOSE,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Cheat Code Central,46,Mind Over Mutant gets more wrong than it gets right leaving anyone who picks up the game with nothing more than the aching feeling of buyer’s remorse.
Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,51,This is a waste of a property that could be great game fare.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN Italia,40,Rodea the Sky Soldier on Wii U is a good idea but a broken game with a frustrating control scheme. Visually its a game of almost a decade ago. Forget it.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,Destructoid,40,Warriors of Troy just about delivers some simple button mashing action without too much fuss but hack n slash fans would do best to wait for Dynasty Warriors 7. That game sports more character in a single trailer than this does in the entire experience.
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,GamingExcellence,40,Fan boys will get theyre fix and thats about the extent of FBMs scope providing little to none entertainment value past the first 30 minutes.
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,44,Long load times and limited magazines feel more like a cheap way to pad the games length than to capture an historic feel especially when these weapons are far more accurate at a far greater range in the game than their real-world counterparts ever were.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Absolute Games,41,The Scourge Project is a perfect example of how an inexperienced developer bit more than they could chew. They wanted to create a multi-platform action title with a great story and a four-player cooperative gameplay but made a threepenny whangdoodle instead.
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,PC Gamer,43,A beautiful but baffling space strategy game. Bugs and bewildering menus make for a frustrating and very missable experience.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gaming Target,45,There is certainly enough content here but the poor controls and graphics dont give players any incentive to check it out.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,1UP,42,As a stand-alone download its a short rendition of the Watchmen brawler experience that features more low points than high points -- but with an admittedly awesome moment of Rorschach punching a fat pervert.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Atomix,45,The first 15 minutes looked promising with an interesting combat system sealed by the Platinum Games experience the rest of the game is half cooked with random repetitive and boring elements that leaves this new Turtle’s adventure as a game that you will not have to play.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,47,Tries very hard to capture the atmosphere and style of the Dinotopia books but for the most part it just isnt a lot of fun to play.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Yahoo!,40,The ridiculous frustration in the early levels will deplete most gamers patience.
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,GamerWeb Sony,40,Lifeless and mundane hits atrocious control impossible scoring non-existent defense and offense set-ups and jerky flawed replays that happened WAY too fast and youve got a game that is seriously lacking in the gameplay category.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine,45,Over in just two to three hours. [Nov 2009 p.78]
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,GameSpot,43,The racing is boring and way too easy the physics are bouncy and unrealistic the rubber-band artificial intelligence is ridiculous and you can easily beat every race in the game in a couple hours.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,43,This is an incredibly slapdash and barren game that has absolutely nothing to offer you beyond monotonous almost-broken fighting mechanics tiny environments and a bunch of lame unlockables.
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GamingTrend,45,If this were a PSP game I may be able to overlook a lot of these short comings but as a PS3 game Last Rebellion is disappointing.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,SpazioGames,40,Chronovolt is definitely a really bad game not worth the amount of space occupied in your memory card.
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Ultimately despite its few hours of gory entertainment Ryder Whites an underwhelming add-on that wed recommend only to fervent Dead Island fans.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GamerWeb Sony,45,Although it does have some neat elements such as being able to play as the bad guy and several spell elements it doesnt make up for the lack of texture quality as well as the shaky framerate and bad camera.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Stuff,45,The disc doesnt do anything that every other third-person action game on the market does better.
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Life,40,AeternoBlade II is a mess of overly-complex mechanics and ill-fitting systems that struggles at all times to keep up with itself. Its core combat is solid but its marred by input lag slow animations messy enemy placement and a struggling framerate. The time-based mechanics are far too numerous confusing and tedious while its long and winding storyline – delivered by some of the worst voice-acting we’ve ever heard – is almost totally nonsensical. Somewhere under all of the technical problems and confusion here there’s a solid game but there’s just far too much jank for players to be expected to wade through to get there and its impossible to recommend that you commit yourself to trying.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,Nintenderos,45,Fimbul offers a boring and repetitive Nordic story accompanied by a graphic lag that directly affects the gameplay.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,PTGamers,45,Lacking co-op and the rest of the cast Beast Rider seems more like a market study than the complete Golden Axe experience we could expect.
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Nintendo Power,40,The gimmick of tilting the Wii Remote like handlebars is as engaging as this game gets. [Apr 2009 p.87]
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Gamers Europe,40,In summary I just cant recommend this because it has virtually no purpose and is horribly tedious - it says a lot that Sam Fox Strip Poker on the ZX Spectrum from 1986 actually had more of a point to playing it even if that point was just to see an awful monochrome drawing of a pair of oversized norks.
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,TheSixthAxis,40,I do admire the effort but in a year where Sonic Mania outdid its franchise’s reputation and Mario stands tall Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back is a mere afterthought. Its length is pathetically short and surprisingly for Bubsy at least the game is really easy. Not everything that could possibly go wrong did go wrong yet if this is the pinnacle of Bubsy games then the poor Bobcat should be laid to rest in peace.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Game Chronicles,40,This is not a game worth buying for anything other than the amusing oddity of having a Harry Potter-themed cover shooter. Its a short game but it still doesnt have the variety in environments that a shooter needs to avoid becoming unacceptably repetitive.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Worth Playing,40,A bargain basement title with more press than gameplay ... and where the only piracy practiced might be the time that it steals from your day.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,Thoroughly unambitious. [June 2008 p.96]
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,IGN,42,The single player portions of this game are not fun. The bot A.I. is erratic models occasionally disappear and reappear steps ahead and many of the games paintball guns are annoyingly inaccurate.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,GameSpy,40,Theres nothing outright horrific about Big Mutha Truckers 2; in extremely short bursts it can even be a bit of no-brainer fun. But theres too much thats underdeveloped and gruelingly tedious over the long haul.
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GamingTrend,44,I tend to review KOEI titles higher than some other reviewers as I have no interest in panning a game that people have put some effort into; on the surface this is not one of those games.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,GameZone,40,This is a game that had potential but that potential was not fully realized. The game is not terrible especially in a multiplayer setting but it just fails to connect in a truly long-lasting entertaining way.
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,GameSpot,45,Extremely difficult puzzles and a vague plot sink this ambitious Myst clone.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Multiplayer.it,50,Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark isnt nearly as good as the previous two episodes.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,XenGamers,58,It’s like Tetris only with... No wait. It’s just Tetris.
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GameSpot,47,Only die-hard fans of Acclaims long-running series should bother with this title.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,Attack of the Fanboy,50,Q*Bert Rebooted is definitely one character that deserved to be rebooted into todays gaming world but while it does retain many of the classic Q*Bert elements spotty controls and inexcusably bad load times make the game extremely mediocre.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,God is a Geek,50,The potential is actually staggering but the reach exceeds their grasp and in the end they’re left with a game that frankly underachieves in almost all the ways that matter.
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,VideoGamesLife,40,Yet another crap Army Men game only about as good as all of its many predecessors put together. Its quite ugly hard to control and really easy: its like your first girlfriend. Youll have fun with it for a couple of hours but after a day or so youll change your phone number and hope it doesnt go psycho.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,N-Insanity,44,Generally a frustrating game that will leave you crying tears of boredom after youre finished.
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Nintendo Life,40,Kids and kids-at-heart may get a thrill out of seeing dinosaurs kinda-sorta duke it out in 3D but the game itself fails to offer much beyond its really simple structure and fight mechanics both of which get old just a little too quick.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,Wccftech,45,Husk is a psychological horror game with broken combat and stealth systems that consistently undoes any sense of tension it tries so hard to build.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Impulsegamer,50,Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise is a step back from the first game with repetitive gameplay a lack of humour and some dodgy presentation and performance issues.
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,COGconnected,40,With a few more level types and a real change in difficulty other than needing better reflexes Johnny Kung Fu would have been entertaining for more than a weekend; as it stands now I would let Mr. Wang win this battle.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,Official Xbox Magazine,45,Charging 10 bucks for such a stellar board game in such shoddy wrapping should be illegal. [Apr 2009 p.79]
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Eurogamer,40,Mediocre unimpressive and uninspired. The handling and physics are competent but the missions are dull and the presentation is shoddy. The most fun to be had is in laughing at the voiceovers.
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,Nintendojo,40,Godzilla Unleashed does too many things poorly to be recommended to anyone but the most diehard of Godzilla fans who will be attracted to some of the games attempted fan service like the impressive roster of monsters.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer,49,Instead of spending $50 on Beowulf the game read the poem instead; this game isnt epic its just epically tedious. [Feb 2008 p.74]
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,PC Gamer UK,40,A cheap and soulless victim of its own lofty ambition. [Oct 2006 p.91]
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,PSX Nation,30,No sensation of speed in a snowboarding videogame = no fun!
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,44,Its a shame as what initially looked promising all those months ago when we first saw it is in fact one of the worst games on Live Arcade. Avoid.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,PSW Magazine UK,40,The PS2 game was never going to compete with the Xbox 360s graphics and neither did anyone expect it to. What we didnt anticipate was a completely dumbed down version that doesnt seem to know whether its a straightforward first-person shooter or a tactical war game.
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,PlayStation LifeStyle,40,By itself it lacks any real compelling reason to buy it.
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Game Chronicles,45,Due to bad camera bad AI bad combat and bad dialogue this game just isnt much fun to play.
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Digital Chumps,48,The games visuals are on par with other DS FPS titles out there and 1-4 player wireless download play is a nice addition for any DS game. However this game really has nothing more to get excited about as the dark and unrefined level design dull A.I. and flawed weapons make the game difficult to enjoy.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Informer,40,This tedious handheld port will do nothing to revive the franchises ailing reputation. [Nov 2003 p.178]
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,PC Gamer,44,A tiny bit of truly awful combat has been thrown in when it should have been thrown out and this may be the last third-person game in existence that doesn’t support the mouse in any way.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,44,The majority of missions have you destroying weapons and taking down terrorists. The bonus levels are just rehashes of things from single-player. Theres little to hold your attention for very long.
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,GamingTrend,45,Please don’t buy this game. Not for your kid not for you. It’s not worth it. Get them more cards or something. They won’t get anything out of this Yu-Gi-Oh game other than story.
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,GamerWeb Nintendo,45,While this game could have been a contender it falls flat onto its face.
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Gaming Age,42,A second rate boxing title that just cant cut it with K.O. Kings.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Deeko,40,This game is definitely not a good demonstration of what the camera is capable of and for people who didnt graduate from EyeToy University this game could be enough to put them off of motion-based gaming indefinately.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,It’s no surprise that a movie-licensed game has turned out rubbish again. There is no excuse for gameplay this dated. Avoid unless you’re feeling very nostalgic.
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,NintendoWorldReport,40,Vaccine isn’t a title I’d recommend even to the most fervent survival horror fans. There just isn’t enough variation to continue playing death after death. Stay away from this one.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,Games.cz,50,After a decade of Cortex Command development weve lived to see its final version. That alone is a cause to rejoice. Unfortunately you will be merry until the very moment when you find out the game is still a semi-finished product with a hint of great gameplay.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,45,In my younger years a kid who lived up the street lets call him Bad Pete had a bright idea involving some frozen Gobstopper candies and his paintball gun. The giant purple welts that followed were far FAR more painful than playing this game but not by much.
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,1UP,42,I hesitate to say that Iron Man is dumbed down for the Wii PlayStation 2 and PSP since hardware limitations likely necessitated such a distinct iteration but the resulting experience is a by-the-numbers affair unlikely to rouse most action fans.
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,TeamXbox,50,Playing this game alone borders on punishment so I stress the point that if you are a loser and do not have any friends; please steer clear of Blackstone and all its unholiness.
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Play UK,48,Released for free this would have been an interesting experiment – if still backed up with a boring chugging racing game. As it stands its the latter point mixed in with a £20-shaped slap in the face. Absolutely pointless.
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,Play UK,44,If you get it for nothing give it a half an hour. If you dont dont. [Issue#219 p.81]
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,YouGamers,45,Its no fun beating up on the little guy but whoever green-lighted the release of SunAge surely must have known that the release code was beta at best.
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,PlayStation Country,40,Submersed ultimately makes some key decisions which will frustrate. Enemies are relentless and inventory management feels botched leading to you require prior knowledge to advance. Stealth is functional but more often than not youre tasked with running from foes that are simply quicker and deadlier than you. Theres a punishment on offer here that doesnt fit the crime and whilst the game tries to do well with a small budget it cant execute on much of it.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,40,Sometime a good idea can shape-up a good game. Thats not the case. Multiplayer in Mindjack couldve saved the day but all the other stuff will give you only an enormous headache.
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Pure Xbox,40,Ironically Infinity Runner is too short for what it is. The gameplay is as repetitive as youd expect but the storyline and non-standard features alleviate that somewhat to the point that it can be entertaining enough at times.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,40,The career mode is insultingly linear short-lived and your progress through it is interspersed with cheesy live-action videos of people giving you mad props for kooking your way through. In addition when you take into account its sub-par visuals a physics system from four years ago and the ludicrous price of admission; RIDE is pure frustration made plastic. [Apr 2010 p.71]
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Cheat Code Central,40,In its defense the enemy AI is more intelligent than ones in your average shooter. If they were any more intelligent they would pick up and find a better game to play in. I advise you to do likewise.
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Adrenaline Vault,40,The unnecessarily tedious unit movement coupled with the debilitating difficulty level of many battles leaves this title stranded with too many moments of frustration for the average user.
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GamerWeb Sony,45,The level design is uninspired the controls ... well dont and the games sense of speed is nonexistent.
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,G4 TV,40,Suffers from a lack of replay value: Once you get the hang of its flawed controls it is possible to get a gold medal in each event within an hour or so of play leaving little reason to ever touch the game again.
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,DarkStation,40,Calvino Noir struggles to overcome problems of its own making. The controls are clunky and make the game more difficult than it needs to be. It fails at communicating its own mechanics so much so that your first interaction with the enemy very likely ends in a very surprising death.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,GamingExcellence,40,I would not recommend Tornado at all. It’s a decent concept (one we’ve seen before) but is executed in an extremely frustrating manner.
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,IGN,35,This title is outright disastrous. It was obviously released without thorough or perhaps any testing. The game is rife with design and performance problems and ultimately is unplayable.
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,We Got This Covered,40,The Bugs Life meets Contra premise of MilitAnt is promising but unfortunately the experience is marred by questionable design decisions and an unreliable targeting system.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Talk Xbox,42,For the little enjoyment being offered and problems that are present a 800 Microsoft point purchase just cannot be justified. There are too many negatives and scarce positives to be found.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Game Informer,43,In a game you need a control scheme that makes sense and works. Buffys doesnt. At all... Try as I might theres nothing that I can compliment or even remotely endorse in this game. [Sept 2003 p.126]
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,eToychest,40,Any kind of story or action present in the game is quickly drowned by the boring repetition that drags this title down like a quagmire.
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,All Game Guide,40,Not only is the control awkward and difficult to master levels are poorly designed and seemingly impossible to complete.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Games Master UK,43,A mildly rubbish shooter. [March 2016 p.80]
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,PSX-Sense.nl,40,A brave but ultimately failed attempt to reintroduce gamers to the Second World War. Awful AI disastrous level design weak textures... name a problem and this game will probably have it in abundance. Skip this.
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,InsideGamer.nl,43,Ive never played such a boring game as Terminator Salvation: The Videogame. The game is repetitive and the storytelling very shallow. Its a big plus that finishing the game will only take you about three to four hours. Even the very reasonable cover system cant let you enjoy this simple and boring movie game.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,41,Sadly you will battle nearly as many bugs as Nazis through the course of Turning Point. For all the game gets wrong which marks about ninety-eight percent of the game they deserve credit for at least writing a solid heroic ending to the game. The trick is plodding through four to five hours of bad to get to the thirty-seconds of goodness.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gameblog.fr,40,Rooted in good intentions but poorly executed.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Hot Games,40,Casual gamers should pass Danger Girl like a bad bowl of chili.
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,GameShark,42,If the game was a bit cheaper and clocked in at something like 400 points instead it might be a bit easier to recommend – but for 800 points Word Puzzle will definitely need some more content released to stay afloat.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Eurogamer Poland,40,Uninteresting combination of unpolished elements. The campaign quickly bores and multiplayer turns out to be only slightly less monotonous.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,RPGamer,40,Everreach: Project Eden somehow manages to avoid being as annoying to play as its constituent parts would indicate and there will be some out there who can get a decent evening or two’s entertainment from it. The game at least flows along quickly and the writing just about holds interest through the six or so hours it takes to see everything on offer. But this papering over fails to deal with the major underlying cracks and it remains one that is impossible to actively recommend.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,4Players.de,45,The hack&slay formula is simple. But Blood Knights doesn’t deliver. That this game and Venetica come from the same dev team is hard to believe.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,GameDaily,40,The turn-based battles that make up the bulk of the game are tedious and boring made worse by their constant bombardment upon the player. The story feels completely unimportant and its telling by the main characters is too cheesy to make anyone care.
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,45,The quests are uninteresting and the games 40 Thrilling Games (as touted by the box) are far from entertaining. I have many fond memories of Six Flags but Fun Park is not one of them.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,Eurogamer,40,Monster Jam is a terrible racing game and a laughable attempt at recreating the hefty impact of monster trucks to boot. With zero challenge and aggravating control I dont think MotorStorm 2 has much to worry about.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,45,For the most part the game is just boring with lackluster gameplay and reused environments and then it gets frustrating. Toss in issues I didnt even mention such as unresponsive weapons and repetitive music and I know I wouldnt want to suit up for this one.
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,40,Power Rangers Super Megaforce is completely uninspired but at least knows who it is trying to target and is adequately made. As a bit of fan service it succeeds in being connected to the show but as a game it is repetitive with half-realised ideas that could have made the experience more engaging but never really live up to their potential.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameZone,40,Quantum Theory looks and feels like an anime-inspired fan mod of Gears of War 1. While Im a devout supporter of doing things right the first time I wouldnt mind seeing a sequel that steps up its game makes better use of Filena and learns from the critical feedback the original received (which is nearly insurmountable at this point).
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gaming Nexus,40,Farming is no fun. You have to get up early you are constantly getting dirty you have to deal with unruly animals and it can be a thankless experience. In other words it sucks. This feeling of tedium and hopelessness is perfectly conveyed in Harvest in the Heartland.
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,Monotonous. [Issue#23 p.97]
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameSpot,40,The Harry Potter film tie-ins end on a low note with this short tedious and conceptually vapid cover shooter.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Jeuxvideo.com,40,Electronic Arts has basically published FIFA 19 on Switch labelling it FIFA 20. FIFA 19 can be bought at a much cheaper price and offers the same content.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,PC Gamer,45,All the gameplay ingredients are here but a complete lack of seasoning makes this one dish that should be tossed down the disposal. [Oct 2004 p.98]
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,PlayStation Country,40,Theres a fun game buried away inside Spuds Uneartheds needlessly complicated exterior but even when you figure out whats going on a chronic lack of challenge kills the game before it ever really gets going.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,Dealspwn,40,Hatred delivers some fleeting sadistic satisfaction and a gorgeous art style but quickly becomes a tedious chore. After all the controversy its disappointing that the finished product is mechanically flawed and otherwise completely forgettable.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN,40,There are few solid gameplay elements such as some clever use of Rita’s grappling hook but the overall feel of the game screams rush job from nearly every angle. The music is generic the VO is repetitive the overall presentation is extremely bland and the gameplay is chalk full of quirky execution.
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Eurogamer Italy,40,New Gundam Breaker is like a dream come true for GunPla collectors... and a nightmare for those who pretends it to be a decent Mobile Suit videogame.
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Play.tm,45,If you are a big fan of darts and watch it religiously then I can see this game being right up your street especially during the months when its not on the television. But for those of you out there that occasionally have a session with your pals down the pub then I suggest you stick with the traditional way of playing darts and avoid this title.
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Eurogamer Spain,40,Short boring and not very inspired. This is exactly what we feared about Move: a rerun of Wiis worst mistakes.
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,Nintendo Life,40,The gameplay is passable and there is a high level of challenge for completionists but the title falls over in almost every other area.
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,games(TM),40,Erase those memories of halcyon days spent nurturing your arthritis with the original coin-op because Streetwise does it no kind of justice. [May 2006 p.124]
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IncGamers,40,Unfortunately Zathura plays like it was won in a car boot sale. Avoid.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Wccftech,50,I dont hate The Elder Scrolls: Blades at least conceptually. Bethesdas lightweight F2P Elder Scrolls game has all the hallmarks of the franchise but delivers them all in such a hollow way that it loses everything that makes the franchise beloved. You might find some enjoyment in the game as I have done but you will inevitably become weary of the dungeons frustrated with the timers and on Nintendo Switch you will find the performance to be at times unbearable. Fans of The Elder Scrolls deserve better than this but its all they will get until The Elder Scrolls VI launches years from now.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Gamereactor Denmark,40,One of the most meager party games weve seen in a while.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gamer 2.0,40,The most enjoyable part of the game would have to be the unlockable Public Service Announcements from the old cartoon show. But chances are you could save the cash and look them up online. And trust us you would be very well served by saving that cash.
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,The most muddled and irritating Sonic game yet. [May 2007 p.110]
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,PSX-Sense.nl,40,Hardly original and poorly executed Super Dungeon Bros could have been a lot of fun were it not for the annoying bugs slow controls and unforgiving difficulty. Shame.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,40,The occasional turn-based tactical shootout could’ve injected some much-needed verve but the arbitrarily frugal placement of cover points too often forces your thugs to stand out in the open and questionable line-of-sight will make you curse the inability to save in the middle of an engagement.
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,IGN,45,The developer worked to get the looks and sounds of the console version on the GBA but they didnt capture the gameplay.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Happy Puppy,45,In and out of the ring this products nothing more than a jobber staring down the most brutal tag team ever to represent the sport: WWF Wrestlemania 2000 and WWF Royal Rumble.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameTrailers,45,The Clone Wars is easily one of the least entertaining parts of the Star Wars mythology Yodas constant tongue-tied tutorials are more troublesome than a Dagobah skinny-dip and the whole game feels like a pale imitation of the superior Lego series.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,GamingTrend,45,There are some decent things going on in Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z. The cel-shaded art style is appealing the dialogue and cutscenes are occasionally entertaining and even the combat is fun at times. But the frustrating camera aggravating controls and a nonsensical story that only briefly touches upon the themes of the series weigh this spinoff title down too much for it to be enjoyable.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,45,This game is essentially a bargain bin Xbox game and it is insulting to see it with a regular Xbox 360 game price tag.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameSpot,40,The Harry Potter film tie-ins end on a low note with this short tedious and conceptually vapid cover shooter.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,n-Revolution Magazine UK,41,Something so workmanlike out of something that was so very inventive. [Issue#19 p.88]
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,IGN,40,Its time to let Myst die. It had its run and now its time for the game to finally stop appearing everywhere. Even when its free Myst is barely worth playing so charging $30 for a portable version is just ridiculous especially since the port absolutely ruins the game.
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,4Players.de,45,The game design is as flat as the pretty ladies are curvy. A totally irrelevant collection of minigames with a hint of Tamaogotchi. But not even the boob bonus can save this beach vacation.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,Vandal,40,If you played Octodad you know that having bad unresponsive controls on purpose can be funny. Surgeon Simulator tries that but it does it in a way that makes you think the controls are broken. It isnt fun but frustrating. The team has promised a patch to fix this so you might want to wait for it before buying it.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Happy Puppy,55,Oh I forgot to mention the horribly painful control and the truly pathetic graphics. Yep definitely a Cruisn title.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Computer and Video Games,40,With only two way multiplayer returning this really was a missed opportunity to improve upon a disappointing franchise. As it stands BW2 gets the smack put down on it by virtually every other fighter out there. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,New Game Network,45,Youll want to steer clear of Dead Alliance especially at its ridiculous $40 price tag. There is a decent game buried here but digging through the bugs shallow gameplay and underwhelming mechanics is just not worth it. If you simply love FPS and are quite fond of the idea of weaponized zombies at least wait until a big price reduction a number of major patches or give it a rental.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,GameSpot,40,There are so many problems with Will of Steel that its hard to know where to begin in terms of describing them but trust us when we say to spare yourself the frustration and avoid this decidedly lackluster game.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Metro GameCentral,40,The whole idea was probably doomed from the start but this is a disappointingly slipshod effort with a story campaign that somehow feels more old-fashioned than the decades-old movie it’s based on.
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,Eurogamer Portugal,30,The younger ones may even feel captivated for some time but they should not endure something so boring for long.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PS3bloggen.se,40,Many parts of this game seems to be rushed during development. Poor controls and that camera is pretty annoying. On the good sides are the epic music and those great voice actors.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,MS Xbox World,35,If you really must play Tron then by all means but dont say I didnt warn you as the appeal wears off pretty quickly.
Farscape: The Game,PC,Aug-8-2002,Red Lemon Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,eToychest,40,The control is passable following a Diablo-esque click-move-click again-move schema. Boring but sufficient.
Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,IGN,44,Its got the heroes but none of their charm. And its yet another example of the Justice League idea never reaching its potential as a game...at least on the handheld side of things.
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,Multiplayer.it,45,While Gardening Mama tries to improve the classic minigame formula by building a sort of structure with some managerial features the result is a shallow uninventive and interesting... classic minigame formula kind of title.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Gamer.no,40,Ben 10: Omniverse is first and foremost a disappointing game with a developer apparently afraid to take any gameplay or story risks with one of Cartoon Networks most popular franchises. The fun and colourful visual design does little to make up for the uninspired brawler based gameplay and wholly uninteresting story.
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,PALGN,45,The game becomes repetitive and boring after just half an hour and the gameplay is just too dull.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Xbox Evolved,40,This brings shame to the name Turtles. Even to the Turtles die hard fans this will just be a stab in your heart.
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Level7.nu,40,Messing around and being violent in a bear infested game world is fun for a while. The same thing goes for the games humor. When the initial wave of entertainment is over youre left with bad gameplay mechanics and repetitive content. Despite an initially entertaining tone this content is not worth the asking price.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,A conversation so watered down its hard to find where the good game has gone. [June 2008 p.96]
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Game Revolution,42,This title may be worth the rental to test the waters but save your real money for another racer as this one is covered in mud.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Destructoid,45,If youre a die-hard fan of the Transformers film series I would recommend picking up Rise of the Dark Spark when its heavily discounted (like under $10) with a group of friends just to play Escalation.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Twinfinite,40,Funk of Titans is a game full of missed opportunities and it’s really a shame. The game has a solid premise that would be good for some great laughs and varied gameplay it just never seems to deliver.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,4Players.de,42,Quotation forthcoming.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Vietnam usually makes for a fresh theatre of gaming war but in the hands of Games Farm it turns out to be quite unexceptional. Suitable for killing time but nothing more. [Nov 2013]
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Gamekult,40,Quotation forthcoming.
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,Nintendo Life,50,Fast Draw Showdown is one of those games you just want to enjoy. If you should find yourself hosting a party one day but have no party games on your Wii to play then rest assured that this game mixes well with friends and moonshine. However it is otherwise not quick enough on the draw to earn its place in video game history.
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,IGN,43,NBA Live’s flaccid return is made all the more disappointing because we waited three years for it. After all that time NBA Live 14 in no way advances the basketball sim genre and worse leaves little to be optimistic about for next year.
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,45,If this series were to receive a significant upgrade – perhaps via the DW: Gundam sequel – it could finally move beyond its troubled past. For now unfortunately it is stuck in a dated mechanically-challenged form that is all but impossible to enjoy.
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,Yahoo!,40,Were the character control tighter level designs a bit more varied and the sound a bit less repetitive it could have been a great way to waste some time with old favorites.
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,COGconnected,38,Sure your child may get an hour of two of cheap thrills but simply put there are far better family oriented Kinect games already on the market that offer much more content replay value and are simply much more polished.
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Gaming Nexus,42,Naughty Bear works as a crazy idea but not as a full-priced video game.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,4Players.de,42,This is absolutely no competition for Uncharted. The fights are boring and bugs ruin the remaining fun. Which is a pity because the vistas and solid puzzles give a glimpse of what this game could have been.
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GamerNode,40,I wanted to like this game--I just couldnt. Whether its the fault of the changes from the Japanese to American version or the minigames themselves something just never clicks.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer,40,I realise first person shooters are getting shorter these days but come on. Did Saber Interactive really imagine that releasing a movie tie-in that you can sleepwalk through inside an hour was going to be acceptable?
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,DarkStation,40,This game is a pretty clear cut disappointment and there is really no other way to say it. It had the potential to be a sleeper hit paving the way for action games on the PSP but ultimately let down with an uninspired storyline and lackluster gameplay.
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,BaziCenter,45,WWE 2K20 is flat out worst entry in the series period. The game is obviously unfinished and is full of bugs and glitches and there is almost no way that even the die hard fans of WWE can enjoy it. WWE 2K series seems to be done for this generation and we can only hope that the new developers will have something to offer on next generation of consoles.
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Meristation,40,Cheap science-fiction lame story and a not-fun gameplay system. Were still wondering why Square Enix wanted to develop an action-paced game without any kind of meaning at all just a copy & paste of games like Gears of War and Uncharted. Nothing interesting here better wait for something thats worthy of our attenttion.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,XGN,45,ENKI is a game that tries to deliver a replayable horror game but does not really succeed in doing that. The game is far too short for its price and the randomisation makes the game annoying more than replayable. Because of that ENKI fails to convince.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Next Generation Magazine,40,Few things are more tedious than a sprawling RPG without any real wit style or engaging characters. [Dec 2001 p.108]
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,DC Swirl,40,Go in peace son as your indiscretion with yet another Acclaim-sponsored disappointment has been forgiven... again!
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Cheat Code Central,40,Once I had committed a few hours to the game and was deep inside Venice leveling up and completing quests I was indeed drawn into the game. But the sordid path it took to get me there and the unnecessary complications of the map were beyond frustrating and would turn away most gamers.
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,Vandal,40,Fans of the series will have a hard time trying to enjoy this game since it’s a repetitive and tedious experience that will fall behind the outstanding games the handheld is showcasing.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,PC Gamer,38,If desiging and producing games was really as boring as Game Tycoon makes it wed all be playing Zork. [July 2006 p.99]
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,IGN,38,Flying is fun the upgrades are neat and the game can look good. However these pros are outweighed by the aforementioned frustration crappy storyline and lame cutscenes.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,45,For the most part the game is just boring with lackluster gameplay and reused environments and then it gets frustrating. Toss in issues I didnt even mention such as unresponsive weapons and repetitive music and I know I wouldnt want to suit up for this one.
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Format,46,A great idea thats failed because of execution. [May 2009 p.96]
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Edge Magazine,40,Star Trek has more bugs crawling on it than a Fear Factor contestant. Sometimes the results are amusing as in the turbolift example but frequently they just make life a drag.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,The Games Machine,35,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle is wrong on so many levels: the gameplay is boring and repetitive the content is basically MIA the graphics are old and inadequate. The concept couldve worked but well it doesnt. If youre a fan of the saga better stick to the classics (or at least Touhou Genso Wanderer).
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameShark,40,It would be cool to have a Splinter Cell or Metal Gear type game on the GBA but Mission: Impossible - Operation Surma isnt it. Decline the mission and disavow any knowledge of this games existence.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Cheat Code Central,40,The only thing this game has going for it is the novelty of creating your own hybrids of dinosaurs.
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,ActionTrip,50,Although you will be involved in an interesting and chilling story theres really nothing more to grab your attention throughout the game. Not to mention it took me less than two days to complete the entire game.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,PSM3 Magazine UK,40,It feels like a clone of The Godfather but nowhere near on the same level in terms of depth and enjoyment. [Jan 2007 p.81]
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,G4 TV,40,The camera is even worse than in the main mode -- odd when it couldve just taken a zoomed-in version of the isometric view that games like Baldurs Gate have used for eons.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,GameSpot,40,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is full of things that make you go hmm. Why do midlevel checkpoints update your score but not save your game forcing you to restart from the beginning if both characters die? If youre going to steal from Gears of War why steal the slow-walking earpiece-cradling mission updates?
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,Jeuxvideo.com,50,It was probably developed with the best intentions in mind but Fear Effect Sedna remains crippled by technical defects and gameplay problems which always draw us out of the game experience.
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Cubed3,40,It is a good idea from Enjoy Gaming but sadly the limited customisation options mean games will usually end up roughly the same. For £3.60 this isnt a bad buy if 3DS owners are looking for a game that contains classic puzzle themes and has a reasonable game editor thrown in but for most people Block Factory simply will not be worth the time or money.
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,The Digital Fix,40,Rather than the suave impressive chat-up line it could so easily have been Time and Eternity instead sashays up to feminism and blurts ‘I like your boobs’ like Seth Rogen’s menacing delivery in Donnie Darko. It could be a misjudged line but it’s not attractive and it’s not funny. It’s just plain creepy.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Nintendo Power,56,The game lets you face off with another player (using two controllers) but the single-player optoins dont offer CPU competition. [March 2005 p.107]
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Your moves are clumsy and unresponsive. Arenas wear you out rather than challenge you. Boss battles are overwrought and underwhelming. The God at the climax of the Land of the Dead is defeated by a drawn-out process of ranged health-whittling and dodge-rolling.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,AceGamez,40,I personally wouldnt recommend ArchLord to anyone; there are much better games out there and much better ways to waste a few hundred hours or so.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Jeuxvideo.com,45,Evolving from the gun’n’run type to the shoot’em up genre Contra Rogue Corps misses too many shots. Everything looks like it’s 10 years late from visuals to gameplay mechanics and sound design.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,God is a Geek,40,Nickelodeon Kart Racers is just about a passable karting game. It feels rushed and bland meaning theres little here to inspire you for very long.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,GamePro,50,Its too bad the play mechanics are not more engaging especially given the potential of the Wii-motion controls. But as is the range of mini-missions and quests you lead the precocious Coraline through will feel familiar to anyone whos played any number of average film-tied titles.
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,IncGamers,40,I should probably have undergone some therapy before writing this review as the game left me frustrated beyond belief.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Cheat Code Central,40,While this game will take you twenty or more hours to complete it is so repetitious and clunky youll swear it was closer to eighty.
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,Game Chronicles,42,I love the concepts story and gameplay ideas behind Brave but they just aren’t executed in a fashion that is remotely playable or enjoyable especially if you have played anything better.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Quotation Forthcoming
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,42,Although Turning Point had an interesting storyline it still ends up being an incredibly limited and generic WWII shooter.
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Game Chronicles,55,Although you will wonder why Log Cutting is a family game you’ll have too much fun to really care. If you don’t have anyone to play with then the fun in this game will quickly diminish but this game will surely bring families together.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameDaily,40,SPRay had potential but its just another bad third party Wii game.
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,PLAY! Zine,40,Short and boring with a story that is to put it simply - bad historical fiction.
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,DarkStation,40,In its current form I simply cannot recommend Hello Neighbor to anyone until all of the problems are fixed. Again I am shocked and disappointed that publisher tinyBuild would charge $30 for a product that clearly needs a lot more work. It really sucks because this game has a few things that work well like its unique mechanics a great art style and good measured horror. There’s a glimmer of something neat but right now its best to treat this as Hello Neighbor Game Preview Edition.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Nintendojo,40,A good strategy game will stretch the mind here and there. In theory tactics should be applicable with actual results. In the simplest terms strategy games should require strategy to play. Perhaps Konami thought they could slide by being the only new game in town.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,40,Stranger is one of strangest games of this year. Or any other year for that matter.
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Above all Rock Revolution just doesnt have the charm or depth of its rivals. [Christmas 2008 p.111]
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,ZTGD,40,MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore is a bad game. This hurts me considering I have been an avid fan of Rainbow’s titles since the PS2 era.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,GameZone,45,Remember that attractive animated style that made Wallace and Gromit so easy on the eyes? Lets just say things havent been quite so pretty for the CSI folks.
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,GamePro,40,Throw in some very uneven game presentation - nice graphics poor instruction manual and plug-your-ears-annoying soundtrack - and gamers are presented with a title that not even the in-game appearance of Wesley Snipes could make appealing.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,40,This was an ambitious production but it boils down to sluggish platforming and repetitive fetch quests. [June 2010 p78]
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,GameShark,40,Despite the chaos you can create everything happens at the same time for the same reasons. There will always be a cop car with its lights on at this corner; that boat will always be there at this time etc.
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,PSX Nation,35,Bland and boring this is a game to avoid unless you are the most rabid of ATV racing fans tanked out of your mind on Schlitz and have precious little else to do.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GamePro,40,Coupled with the terrible combat the game is only 2 hours long.
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,The Digital Fix,40,A decade ago Arcania would be a pretty decent RPG. Time has not been friendly to this game and repackaging something that was never a classic to begin with is a misguided move.
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,PSM3 Magazine UK,38,Basically this is a hugely simplified pointless and weird version of Power Stone. So get that instead. [Feb 2007 p.78]
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,Digital Chumps,40,Some believe sports games to be one of the easiest games to develop and difficult to get wrong and then something like TWT comes around and proves that even something as straightforward as tennis can go awry.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Extreme Gamer,45,I can not recommend Science of Evil on the PSP if you want a good Hellboy experience pick up a comic or check out the film.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,IGN,45,After three hours (if you can make it that far) of crappy controls mediocre visuals and boring and generally unimaginative gameplay youll actually be glad to have finished the game so you can return it or burn it and move on with your life.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,GameBiz,45,Shattered Universe takes that one episode and turns it into an entire game with minor references to a few other Star Trek episodes.
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,Gaming Age,42,The Wii game was disappointing at best. The controls arent problematic which is the best thing I can say and something that should be expected coming from High Voltage but everything else about the game just screams quick movie cash-in.
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Honestly no one will want to play this for more than 10 minutes. [July 2009 p.81]
Deca Sports 3,Wii,Oct-26-2010,Hudson | NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Sports | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,40,No matter how many modes the game claims to have Deca Sports 3 is too poorly designed to be entertaining and when your standard motion controls are better than the enhanced MotionPlus controls something is horribly wrong here.
Rugby 18,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Koch Media,Sports | Team | Rugby,Push Square,40,Though Eko Software has tried to give virtual rugby a breath of life – and in some ways with a revamped control and camera system it has – the lack of modes and dismal presentation leave a bad taste in the mouth. At full-price Bigben is demanding an obscene amount of money for a game that feels years behind where it should be.
Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Gamer's Hell,47,Legacy: Dark Shadows just isn’t fun. It tries so hard to mimic great adventure games like that of The Longest Journey but sadly only does so graphically which isn’t a good thing.
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,Media and Games Online Network,40,This is a pretty bad game that has endless sprawling caves as gameplay areas and equally dull gameplay within them.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,40,The score is deceptive. There are worse superhero games you could be playing. In the end though there arent any secrets that dont apply to gamplay so theres not much reason to revisit this.
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,GameSpot,40,Its unfortunate however that the number of bugs infesting it make things so problematic and frustrating. The games spooky ambiance and appealing nature are enjoyable but not enough to overshadow the humdrum puzzle solving nor to distract you from glitches.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,IGN,40,Nothing about Things on Wheels is very good. The single-player mode is boring the game looks like it was supposed to come out years ago (which it was) and the attempt at a story is poorly implemented and even more poorly written.
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,GameZone,45,This game is not worth your money or even the time it takes to download it. Not having the ability to play against another human is a huge strike to this game. Bottom line is to avoid this game.
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Games Master UK,42,About as much fun as a Transformer that converts into a lump of coal. Give it a miss. [Sept 2010 p.99]
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Gamers' Temple,38,25 to Life just doesnt have anything going for it that warrants a look at the game unless youre gangsta obsessed or bored out of your mind after playing every other available Xbox game out there. Save yourself the frustration and spend your gaming dollars elsewhere.
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,Absolute Games,30,The only difference between this game and the horrendous Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods is that its almost bug-free.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GamePro,40,The PSP version however has this incredibly unfun dual-pronged fork-in-the-eye problem of too many pokey load breaks paired with one...h-ell of a...won---ky fra-me...rate. There were so many times until I got used to it that I thought the game was just going to crash altogether.
Damnation,PC,May-22-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Total PC Gaming,40,Damnations good ideas are unfortunately never matched by its rough unfinished and unsatisfying execution. [Issue#21 p.56]
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,DS,Jun-17-2008,Farmind Ltd,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Worth Playing,40,It actually left me frustrated because it manages to do a lot right but ultimately its too lacking in too many areas to be something I can recommend.
One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,Game Informer,40,One Way Trip is a bore from beginning to end. I was never invested in its story despite trying to force myself to be and was instead either bored or annoyed the entire time. Relief washed over me when the credits finally rolled.
Alien Blast: The Encounter,PC,Feb-9-2004,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Cheat Code Central,40,If youre anything like me you wont be able to play it for any length of time unless youve got something on your mind that youre concentrating on that is far removed from the game. Its perfect for zoning out.
Robot Arena,PC,Apr-1-2001,Gabriel Interactive,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Breeding/Constructing,Yahoo!,40,The robot construction is simplistic in the extreme the arenas are forgettable and the actual combat is the epitome of boredom.
Rally Challenge 2000,Nintendo 64,Jun-30-2000,Europress,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Electric Playground,40,Bringing gamers a sense of nostalgia may be alright in space shooters and RPGs but in a racing game especially in the visuals department it just isn’t right.
Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,NintendoWorldReport,40,Emergency Heroes feels very rushed since theres just not much to it. The entire game took me approximately four hours from start to finish and that’s four hours too many for something as generic and repetitive as this.
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,Eurogamer Germany,40,Nonetheless keep your chin up Emobi Games. The first step has been made. 7554 brought Vietnam on the map of games developers. The next step is an actually good game. And you´ll get there. Someday.
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Worth Playing,40,How can a game this bland and uninteresting compete with the likes of Excite Truck and Need for Speed: Carbon let alone the scores of racers available on other consoles? Simply put it can’t; and it should be avoided at all costs.
Timeline,PC,Nov-12-2000,Timeline Computer Entertainment,Action | General | General,GameSpot,42,When the game is over which is very quickly youll hardly remember a thing about it.
MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,IGN,40,While the subject matter is full of exciting potential the imprecise controls and repetitive movements across events keep Motionsports Adrenaline from becoming a hit.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Wii,Nov-16-2010,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Nintendo Life,30,With seven months until the release of Part 2 we can only hope that EA learn from their mistakes here and step things up for Harrys grand finale.
The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,35,Even if you were completely charmed by Philip Pullmans work or enjoyed the movie adaptation theres absolutely no reason to give this game a try. Even the music as pretty as it is cant redeem such poor gameplay and atrocious presentation.
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Push Square,40,Gungrave VR has a poorly implemented control scheme a lack of story content it doesn’t take advantage of the technology available in the PSVR headset and ultimately lacks enjoyment in its core gameplay. Unfortunately Gungrave VR has failed to raise the series from the grave and we’d advise everyone to let this one lay to rest.
Waking,PC,Jun-18-2020,Jason Oda,Action | General,TheSixthAxis,50,Waking is a fascinating experiment that tries but ultimately fails to combine two radically different ideas together. Less would certainly have been more here as the clunky and overly confusing action parts get in the way of the interesting narrative and psychological aspects. While I was drawn in by the central conceit and the use of meditation the end result is more likely to leave you in a coma than drag you into the light.
JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,Trickstar Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Eurogamer Germany,40,Before I play Janes Advanced Strike Fighters again Id rather have another go at HAWXs 2. And that is not something I say lightly.
Taito Legends Power-Up,PSP,May-17-2007,Empire Oxford,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Play.tm,35,To put it simply if the idea of thirty very simple arcade games with no real objective other than good old fashioned high score setting appeals and you can put up with the strained atmosphere of craziness then you may get some fun out of this well presented but ultimately flawed collection.
Rapala Tournament Fishing!,Wii,Nov-22-2006,MagicWand,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Gamestyle,40,So the answer is that there is no worthwhile experience in Rapala Tournament Fishing to be discovered.
DARK,PC,Jul-3-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,IGN,40,Dark is a stealth action adventure thats brimming with good ideas but poor AI a weak story and repetitive gameplay drive a three-pronged stake through the heart of its entertainment value. Darks cel-shaded settings occasionally allow the otherwise drab experience to shine but not without a forgettable protagonist and clunky movements sinking their fangs into the fun.
Seduce Me,PC,Jan-2-2013,None,Strategy | General | General,Armchair Empire,40,The game itself doesnt possess enough personality (or challenge) on its own to stand out as unique in the admittedly small field of AO games.
Lets Fish! Hooked On,PlayStation Vita,Jan-29-2013,SIMS,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Pocket Gamer UK,40,Lets Fish! Hooked On is not the fishing game you are looking for on account of its glitchy repetitive play.
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,PC,Oct-17-2006,Apeiron,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | General | Modern,Worth Playing,40,New Jagged Union is not merely a bad game when compared to its peers but it is a bad game when compared to any titles released in the last several years. I cannot in good faith advise any fan of tactical strategy to make this a purchase.
Turtle Tale,3DS,May-22-2014,Saturnine Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,40,Turtle Tale winds up being a game that shows some promise for fans of retro action platformers but the lack of depth and variety create an experience where fun gives way to repetition far too quickly.
Street Supremacy,PSP,Feb-28-2006,Genki,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,DarkStation,40,With the street racing genre having done to death already this copycat is a lazy port of the poor Dreamcast racer. If youre looking for a quality title look elsewhere.
Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,GameWatcher,40,Without the nostalgia factor its just a very short and dated experience with a glimmer of the wonder that once gripped the arcade world. Thats really not enough to compete with whats out there now.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Gamenikki,40,The recipient of the Coaster of the Year award. Beer steins everywhere are smiling.
101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix,Wii,Jan-13-2011,Nordcurrent,Sports | General | General,N-Europe,50,Too many sports spoil the broth.
007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Informer,40,Its a bad game when its working but there are plenty of moments that make you wonder how it even got cleared for release. Enemy AI frequently freaks out causing soldiers to endlessly sprint against walls (often firing their guns at the ground). At one point the framerate dropped to unplayable levels except it wasnt during a firefight – I was just walking around.
Mall Tycoon,PC,Feb-3-2002,Holistic Design | Inc.,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gamers' Temple,40,While this might seem to be a mall rats dream Mall Tycoon falls short of the mark as either a business simulation or a shopping center builder.
Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project,Xbox 360,Jun-23-2010,3D Realms,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Horizontal,Extreme Gamer,45,Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project is going to appeal to a very niche market of gamers mainly the ones who have found memories of playing the original Duke games or even this 2D offshoot.
Clash of the Titans,PlayStation 3,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Eurogamer Portugal,40,The negative aspects are rather abundant in Clash of the Titans so this isnt something recommendable unless you are really fans of hack n slash and no longer have anything to play.
0 Day Attack on Earth,Xbox 360,Dec-23-2009,Gulti,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Target,40,Twin stick shooter fans have many other places to look to get their fix on the XBLA and almost all of them would be a better choice than 0 Day.
Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,PlayStation Universe,40,The best thing about Iron Man 2 are the cut scenes where some competent writing and voice acting makes the game seem like it just might be worth ploughing through even though it isn’t.
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,PlayStation Universe,40,Dollhouse takes good ideas and puts them behind clashing mechanics. The randomly-generated landscapes all look the same causing many issues with navigating and retrieving much-needed items. This pool of ideas lacks cohesion and the minuscule payoff makes the tedium feel like a complete waste of time. Very little works in Dollhouses favor.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,GameBiz,46,It contains nothing special and brings nothing new to the genre meaning it falls below the other better Combat Flight Simulators out there.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Nintendo Life,30,Unfortunately Nickelodeon Kart Racers is simply not good; derivative mechanics a pathetic character roster and awful performance make this a bargain bin experience that you’ll be glad you missed. If you absolutely have to play a racing game with Nickelodeon characters then by all means go ahead but we’d highly recommend you take a pass on this sorry effort.
Way of the Dogg,Xbox 360,May-3-2013,Echo Peak,General | Action | General,Meristation,40,Way of the Dogg is a laziest branded game of the year. It has some nice ideas but the execution isnt good at all.
4PM,PC,Jul-9-2014,Bojan Brbora,Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,4Players.de,38,The filmmakers’ interactive experiment fails on a variety of levels: technically mechanically and most disappointing when it comes to storytelling.
WWII Aces,Wii,Mar-21-2008,Arcade Moon,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Cheat Code Central,44,A long campaign doesnt help if the gameplay itself is intrinsically bad. Poor graphics partially shoddy controls boring objectives and frustrating repetitive missions make WWII Aces one to steer clear from unless youre a glutton for punishment.
Delta Force: Xtreme 2,PC,May-27-2009,NovaLogic,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,IGN,48,The only thing thats xtreme about this game is how extremely mediocre it is. The missions are uninspired the authenticity is lacking the servers are under-populated but hey at least it looks dated right?
Slain!,PC,Mar-24-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN Spain,40,We can only think on what Slain! could have been and cry.
Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Hooked Gamers,40,Stealth games are meant to be challenging and should feel like a tense punishing experience. But Alekhine’s Gun is stretch too far and instead punishes you because of its poor mechanics and terrible AI.
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,GameSpot,37,Tank Beat isnt much fun. Theres very little to it and what is there is bland and simplistic. If theres one feat developer MileStone managed to pull off its how dull it managed to make the act of blowing up tanks. That might be a fascinating accomplishment but it makes for an utter bore of a game.
The Polar Express,GameCube,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,38,Just dont come running back to us if little Johnny decides he hates you and moves out aged six when he finds this under his Christmas tree.
Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,Nintendo Insider,39,To the game’s credit the constantly progressing storyline and environments do give Around the World in 80 Days some pizzazz but it can’t completely hide the repetitive rudimentary gameplay.
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,IGN,38,The suckage wasnt just saved for the visual and auditory portion of Hail to the King though...no no. Gameplay is equally as tedious.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Truly sub-standard. [Aug 2010 p.105]
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,Multiplayer.it,45,The Chaos Engine comes as a mere re-release of the original shooter from 1993 without any remastering nor extra options.
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendo Insider,35,One of the most disappointing and lackluster games on the GameCube today...No matter what type of gamer you are though there are many flaws in the game which are inexcusable – the game’s length lack of challenge (apart from Survival Mode) monotony and bad graphics and sound.
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,Nintendo Power,46,The difficulty level is a tad high for young players and the gameplay is very repetitive. [Jan 2004 p.160]
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,IGN,27,This thing is a real banana in the tailpipe of Dreamcast racing. Stay far far away...it may be contagious.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,We Got This Covered,40,Ace Banana isn’t a total trainwreck and might be a fun diversion for younger players for a while but there’s a chance that even they will ultimately come away frustrated.
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,GamesRadar+,40,The cities are huge and beautiful with country-appropriate cars and while the gameplay is muddy it’s easy to see how it could have been better. But as it is DRIV3Ris all flash and little substance.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,The weirdest floatiest controls imaginable. [Feb 2008 p.94]
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Worth Playing,40,If you are a hardcore action shooter fan you may be insulted by the total lack of challenge or variation in the gameplay and if you are not there is nothing here to attract you to this uninspired generic disappointment. This is one confession that should have stayed within the family.
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,FNintendo,40,The overall difficulty level is low and will not pose any problem for players with a bit of experience which inadvertently ends up throwing the game against the expectations of its target audience of players longing for RPGs from the early 1990s. Chronus Arc ends up falling significantly below its potential in several fields.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamesRadar+,40,WayForward’s second Adventure Time game fails to marry the imagination of the Cartoon Network series with a top-down dungeon crawler resulting in a lifeless quest that does neither the cartoon nor the genre any justice.
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,n-Revolution Magazine UK,36,It may be one of the best of its breed but thats like saying smallpox is the best communicable disease. [Issue#22 p.74]
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GameFocus,36,There is no real value in this title because of the control gameplay and difficulty issues. If a patch was released with a control upgrade for the classic controller and to fix other issues I would say the game would be worth buying but not at the moment.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Jolt Online Gaming UK,38,A lot of the good intentions in Psychotoxic are just lost in the mess of it all. We might have recommended the story to fans of sci-fi B-movies but frankly after a few interesting cut-scenes the story goes absolutely nowhere for hours before wrapping-up in a not-entirely-satisfying manner.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PC Zone UK,32,If you want something to put on the box Mr. Marketing Man try this: This is so bad it is like beating old ladies to death with hammers.

Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,Nintendo Gamer,47,Tables are too squished on the DS screen making the balls seem massive but using the stylus to direct the cue and set power is pretty effective. [Apr 2007 p.70]
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Adrenaline Vault,40,With clearly low production values this game is ultimately quite boring. Dreary drudgery is what you have to slog through to get to the end and believe me it is just not worth it.
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GamesRadar+,40,We can’t think of any good reason to spend time with Eureka 7 Vol. 2. Even if the story intrigues you you’ll have to suffer through the rest of the game to see it. It’s just not worth it.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Eurogamer,40,Whats most frustrating is that with more enemies more graceful control and a more compelling structure theres no reason why a retro-styled Adventure Time roguelike couldnt have been an absolute treat and a game worthy of the show.
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpot,36,This simplistic brawlers condescending attitude and one-note gameplay make it worth dodging.
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PlayStation Universe,40,Painkiller: Hell & Damnation is an old-school FPS that is sadly dated boring and tedious to play.
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,DarkZero,40,The game is all about making more money to progress but the grind to get it is monotonous meaning most will lose the will to toil away on the farm long before getting access to the bigger better machinery.
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,Cheat Code Central,40,I’m going to be honest with you I haven’t finished Escape Dead Island yet. I just can’t bring myself to. The game plods along at a snail’s pace and just never hooks you. It’s certainly not the worst game I have ever played but it’s bland and generic and feels rushed and unfocused.
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,40,Inner Chains is a title that you would expect to find in Early Access given the many issues that affect it.
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,NZGamer,45,Theres nothing to save this shambles and no way to recommend it to anyone. If youre a fan of the movie this will ruin it for you and if you like brawlers theres a thousand better ones (some from more than 20 years ago outstrip this easily) to satiate your desires. Avoid.
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,GamePro,40,Also disappointing was the lack of any head-to-head or multi-player functionality; theres no unlockable content either. The games themselves are monotonous and dont really instill you with a need to play them repeatedly.

Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,PSM Magazine,40,Even if youre a fan of anime we recommend you keep your distance from Mamodo Fury. [Nov. 2006 p.81]
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Destructoid,40,Still its not the worst thing on shelves right now but its $49.99 price tag isnt doing the game any favors either. Maybe as a deep discount title or even a digital download with some of the games more frustrating modes stripped out (let me run over zombies for ten bucks!) Blood Drive might have been a more attractive proposition.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Gamer.nl,40,Prison Break is a disappointment on all fronts. The fighting system has been badly implanted and the presentation is lacklustre. The only redeeming features are the sneaking around and the development of the plot but it’s not enough to keep this game from falling flat on it’s face. Someone throw the keys away.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,G4 TV,40,Squarely intent on holding the middle ground in every sense of the phrase this isnt a terrible game but it isnt especially good either.

Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Machinima,40,A game that not even die hard Family Guy fans will appreciate. The jokes and crude humor are taken too far even for the shows standards. Couple that with drab gameplay and poor controls and youve got a game that should be avoided by most accounts.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PSX Extreme,41,The Golden Compass really isnt anything more than yet another game based on a movie that falls well shy of quality. ‘sigh The trend may never die.
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,All that said Scourge is cheap and if youre looking for a no-frills co-op shooter to keep you and three friends mildly entertained you could do worse.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,GamesRadar+,40,If your biggest complaint about previous such entries is that they didnt include horseback riding hang gliding or skiing then MotionSports might get you in front of the TV for a weekend of flawed fun. Otherwise we suggest leaving this one on the sidelines.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,MEGamers,36,A repetitive nature not yet seen in the current generation of gaming.

Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,33,Deep Black: Reloaded is an underwater Gears of War clone. While a good idea in theory the execution here is all wrong. Frustrating action poor checkpointing boring level designs and enemies that take far too many bullets to kill. There are some good ideas here but you have to dive deep to find them!
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,NZGamer,40,The gaming equivalent of buying a gourmet mince and cheese pie - youll be uncertain youve got your moneys worth and pretty sure you could have done a better job.
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,ZTGD,40,The entire time I played Montague’s Mount I felt lost helpless blind crippled and confused. Unfortunately that doesn’t make for a very good or interesting game.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Deeko,40,Its pure repetitiveness is enough to make any chocolate lover long for a nice salty snack treat. So make your dentist happy and stay far far away from this title. It will leave a very bitter aftertaste and have you reaching for your mouthwash.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Adrenaline Vault,40,A key problem may simply be that the international system is too hard to replicate under its current condition of relative anarchy.
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Developer Kylotonn has crafted the least appealing fantasy brawler imaginable its stillborn mechanics drenched in over-compensatory cutscene-driven storytelling its charms limited to the lure of unlockable combos and abilities.
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,38,The result is a brutally slow pace and a game that doesnt pack much of anything for anybody. The AI is horrendous the control is abysmal and the announcing... [Jan 2004 p.73]
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,DarkStation,40,Huge sporting events dont translate well into video games as the developer goes for quantity instead of quality making it a sad button mashing affair.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,42,Its what a bag of roast beef crisps is to a Sunday roast with all the trimmings. [Sept 2007 p.90]
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,Meristation,40,With poor graphics bad gameplay (despite some interesting points in the battle system) and bland story Drive Girls fails to match the quality of the popular franchise Senran Kagura despite some more than evident similarities in concept. The driving parts dont look like part of a professional game.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,PC Gamer,40,While not a total disaster [it] barely even offers cosmetic upgrades to the 2000 versions incredibly dull gameplay format. [Oct 2003 p.112]
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,GamerWeb Sony,35,Some of the worst gameplay Ive ever had the misfortune of laying eyes on and the entire look and feel of the game is seriously lacking.

25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,The A.V. Club,33,You have to struggle with touchy controls and flaws in the game logic. For example if you hang onto a human shield for too long the cops will just shoot your hostage to get him out of the way. How is that fair to anybody?
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,VGPub,45,Pocket Racer[s] screams budget title in every way. The gameplay is generic even by mid-’90s standards the graphics are bland and the sound will leave you wanting a lot more.
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,35,The Eternity Clock is a simple platformer rife with tacky bugs abrasive puzzles and timey-wimey guff.
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Game Chronicles,40,Wacky Races: Crash & Dash is not very well put together and suffers from lackluster gameplay.
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,CGMagazine,40,I wish I could be more kind to this game considering it’s an indie title with big ambition but considering Horizon: Zero Dawn and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild came out only a few weeks ago and how similar Troll and I is trying to be to those games there’s really no excusing it.
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,Nintenderos,35,Its a pretty denigrating game. In addition HD vibration and motion controls have to learn a lot of eroticism yet. If they wanted perversion they could have gone to the extreme and not stay in the bikinis with small moans and senpais.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,ZTGD,40,The original game is still more complete and more fun than the 3DS version and it is 15 years old.
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,GamePro,40,Also disappointing was the lack of any head-to-head or multi-player functionality; theres no unlockable content either. The games themselves are monotonous and dont really instill you with a need to play them repeatedly.
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,35,This is a kids game. Its also a bad kids game. And theres really no getting around that.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,SpazioGames,40,Macfarlane is a man of many talents. Understanding what makes a videogame great is not one of them unfortunately.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,GameSpot,40,This factory comes off more like a real industrial complex than the fantastic playground of a fop who makes candy with magical midgets.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,TotalPlayStation,35,Nothing about 35 To Life makes it stand out -- save for perhaps the fact that we had to sit through a delay to get this product. Its not terribly fun the storyline is pointless and the gansta tone is utterly unnecessary.
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Nintendo Life,40,A confused messy stealth-puzzler with flaky physics and dodgy controls. Hello Neighbors attempt to do something fresh with a classic cinematic concept is to be applauded but the execution falls flat. A massive missed opportunity.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,Totally360,40,In all honesty though its too pricey and the standard text input method will drive you absolutely crazy within ten seconds of trying to enter a word.
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Digital Chumps,40,Regardless JU-ON: The Grudge: Haunted House Simulator provides very little entertainment beyond the surface appeal and jump scares.
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Game Over Online,40,Thor for the 360 and PS3 is a sub-par God of War clone that does a surface-level job of replicating what makes that kind of game work while missing the point of what works on any kind of deeper level. If you like that style of game play either that series or any other games like it that have been mentioned. The lack of polish here makes it impossible to recommend as a purchase at any price although if you must rent it go with the 360 version since it lacks a mandatory 3GB install. If the movies fresh in your mind and you want a fun Thor game to play try out the 8-bit throwback on Marvels site or use him in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,DarkStation,40,Unlike the dedicated officers of the R.I.P.D. do yourself a favor and just let this one go. I don’t think this needs anymore words to get that point across.

Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamestyle,40,Nothing more than an aggressive version of dodge ball which does contain some initial attraction that unfortunately quickly wanes.
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,Four Fat Chicks,40,It is to the best of my knowledge the biggest point-and-click real-world-image game ever created. Sadly in all other respects it gives even the least of its peers nothing to aspire to. It doesnt take long to realize that the full screen images of Anacapri (the place) are the only good thing about the game.

The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,40,The Deer God starts off on an interesting note and features a visual style that catches the players eyes but unfortunately it does not capitalize on its assets and quickly becomes an uninteresting unappealing and repetitive game that could have been much more compelling had its best elements been fully explored.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,Computer Games Magazine,30,Theres little for you to do other than play with staffing percentages and earn some cash to purchase new styles of coffee. [Mar 2007 p.67]
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,Nintendojo,40,Too few mini-games too little fun and frustrating navigation ruin what is essentially an interesting concept.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Games Master UK,32,A disgrace. When double jumps arent the worst part somethings gone terribly wrong. [Dec 2015 p.78]
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,GameSpy,40,Turn It Around is a one-trick pony thats still looking to perfect its one trick.

Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,Multiplayer.it,40,A very bad fighting game that try to surf the wave of his popular license without any kind of result.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Cheat Code Central,32,Unfortunately if the Wii version of AITD is any indication as to where this series is headed then nostalgia may be all that is left for its many fans.
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Cheat Code Central,40,Where Flight of the Falcon goes wrong is in trying to make the GBA display 3D environments for an entire game.

Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,eToychest,30,Given that the DS hardware is woefully underutilized Burnout Legends is simply a shoddy game. The essential ingredients are here but there are flash games that have had more quality work put into them.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,AceGamez,35,And well that’s about it. You jump between islands (well still shots of islands) you give and receive arbitrary gifts from Zack and the other girls which supposedly determine who will and won’t be your friend (these girls really are quite shallow y’know) and you play a bunch of dire mini-games. If that sounds fun – Paradise is the place for you or Zack Island or whatever it’s called.

Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,Gamers' Temple,35,Theres no reason to recommend this game to anyone. Its short but feels longer than it is because its so frustrating and poorly designed. The graphics are poor the 3D effects rudimentary and the controls are terrible. Other than that its fine.

Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Eurogamer Italy,40,Umbrella Corps is a poorly made spin-off and probably the worst game in the Resident Evil franchise. A bunch of interesting idea cant overcome all the technical flaws and the forgettable gameplay created by Capcom.
G.I. Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,PC Gameworld,35,With only a few good features GI Combats disconnected and confusing nature will probably make you glad the war is over.

Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Gaming Nexus,38,Godzilla Unleashed has all the makings of a good monster fighting game and none of the content
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,GameOver.gr,40,A bland uninspired game with old-school gameplay and boring design. Think twice before you cross paths with Eric Bane.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpot,40,Its not zombies you need worry about in the painfully dull The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Machinima,45,Out of the Shadows has all the trimmings of a fantastic brawler but none of it works as it should. For every highlight the game showcases there are multiple failures: shoddy controls a complicated combat system and far too many glitches.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,GameZone,35,The coup de grace was slowdown that plagued the game from beginning to end even when running through the many vacant hallways.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamingExcellence,38,It is a shame that VR is nothing more than a poor man’s Splinter Cell with a dash of Resident Evil thrown in for flavour.
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,MS Xbox World,35,Destined to prematurely hit the bargain bucket of game stores worldwide Thor fails miserably in its bid to reignite the action and excitement that this summers blockbuster superhero smash brought to the big screens in waves. Predictably as a videogame movie adaptation Thor fails epically. Interestingly enough though as a cure for long-term insomnia it cant be highly enough recommended.
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,We Got This Covered,40,Unfairly difficult and technically incompetent Project Root is a classic example of a good idea gone horribly horribly wrong.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,GameSpot,35,Poor controls and a ton of pointless gimmicks make for one frustrating round of Astroturf golf.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,3DJuegos,32,Raven Squad is bland boring and definitely not fun. Avoid it at all cost.
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,GamingExcellence,38,Seven Kingdoms: Conquest fails to do anything right. Balance problems technical issues pace story graphics…I can go on. It’s not worth playing.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine,35,Youd think it would be hard to mess up a samurai game but developer Genki has managed to deliver a royal swordplay stinker with Kengo: Legend of the 9. [Dec 2007 p.76]
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,All Game Guide,40,Control is brutal in this game forcing players to grit their teeth and redo each maneuver multiple times before it registers correctly.
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,4Players.de,39,First of all Blades of Time wasn’t a particularly good game when it was originally released seven years ago. And with this version showing even more performance issues than back then I cannot find any reasonable answer why this game was granted a re-release.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GameSpot,35,If Rock Revolution came out two or three years ago it might have been revolutionary but in 2008 its not even relevant. Uninspired presentation a tiny tracklist that includes no master tracks a complete lack of vocal support uninteresting gameplay and a barebones Career mode are just a few of the many ways in with Rock Revolution fails.
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameSpot,32,Whether youre a fan of the cartoon or a fan of fighting games Legend of the Dragon is a total disappointment.
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Gaming Age,33,Heavy Fire: Red Shadow is just not good. It tries to be a decent game but just fails on every level. The inclusion of VR just adds hope that it will at least be fun for a little while but it turns out just being more of a headache. I figured VR was included to generate some interest in what is essentially a bargain bin title. It’s very basic but there is just no fun to be found here. I cannot recommend even trying this one out even to experience the VR mode as it just doesn’t deliver any kind of lasting appeal.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GMR Magazine,40,A crappy lock-on system snaps the Terminators weapon right to a target oftentimes one thats right underneath a grate and thus untouchable all the while ignoring a more obvious threat.
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Games Master UK,38,The shame here isnt that this is a a bad beat-em-up. Its that its a good one saddled with so much nonsense and tedium that youre unlikely to care. [Aug 2014 p.78]
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Twinfinite,40,Despite this generous clutch of problems there is an odd charm to the game. Its schlock is part of its allure and each time I loaded the game I felt as though I was returning to a well-thumbed piece of pulp horror trash or sliding an old VHS B-movie slasher into the machine – its cheap ghouls awash with scan lines. I found myself smirking way more than I was frustrated but I can’t in good conscience say it’s worth picking up outside of the bargain bin you’d find the films it takes its cues from.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamestyle,40,Potter fans will be disappointed by this lazy attempt that is substandard fare and lacks options. EA Bright Light will have to revolutionise its approach if the franchise is to end on a high.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Games.cz,40,Unfortunately only an amount of frustration and badly made game is hidden in the tempting package. For a good horror adventure you must go elsewhere.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,Frustrating disheartening and broken in places: a perfect recipe for making kids cry. [Christmas 2007 p.95]
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GamerWeb Sega,40,In keeping with the fine ECW tradition this game is a vile piece of garbage thats a rip-off at half the price.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Digital Entertainment News,38,Left Behind: Eternal Forces misses on all cylinders. The game needs a serious tune-up on nearly every level.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameZone,35,Plagued by a series of problems that go way beyond the awful controls the action just isn’t fun or rewarding enough to keep gamers wanting to see this through to the end.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Cheat Code Central,40,Not only is Evolution Snowboarding a lame snowboarding game but its a lame fighter as well so you know what that makes the whole game dont you?
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GamePro,30,One of the most maddening problems is that each time you die (which happens a lot) you respawn at the beginning of the level. There is no continue option and you can’t skip the-story-so-far screens.
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamerWeb Nintendo,35,This game is for little Timmy not for you.
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Impulsegamer,40,As combat plays an integral part to Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor and if the Kinect controls worked flawlessly this game would have been a blast as you fought your enemies. To make matters worse checkpoints between deaths are far too long which makes it an effort to continue.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,3DJuegos,40,Its poor graphics repetitive missions and awful controls make this Godzilla a bad videogame.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,IGN,35,A very poor remake of a classic arcade game. The Level 30 bug definitely hurts the product but in all honestly it just makes a bad game worse.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,IGN,40,Pure Futbol is a mess of a soccer game. Its cover claims that an authentic experience awaits but whats actually in store for players who pick up this game is far from the real deal.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Everyeye.it,40,One of the worst Tie-Ins in videogame history. Theres simply no reason in the world to buy this game. Poor graphics and frustrating gameplay mean only failure.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Games Master UK,36,The graphics would shame a third-party N64 game - theyre that bad. [Mar 2007 p.74]
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Eurogamer Italy,40,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle fails in so many basic aspects of the fighting genre that it will be hard to enjoy the game even if you a are die hard Touhou fans. Gameplay is repetitive and boring the game falls short on contents and graphics feels so dated that this could be easily mistaken for a N64 or at least for an early PS2 game.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,ZTGD,35,Overall I was left feeling empty whilst playing Randall. A game that tried very hard to shine with its varying gameplay styles but ends up failing on all fronts; and totally messes up the platforming elements making it frustrating to play.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,IGN,35,Don’t be fooled by the fact that it’s a familiar brand that Nintendo published it or that it’s a limited release: this game is a bad one.
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,Modojo,40,In the end Napoleon Dynamite: The Game does little to fight the stereotype of low quality licensed games.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,Times Online,40,The result in single-player mode is a messy unresponsive mass of button-pushing and frantic joystick-twiddling that evolves from impossible to challenging to repetitive and dull in less than an hour.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,GameSpot,34,Not only does Pocket Pool miserably fail to deliver an enjoyable game of billiards but its attempts at titillation are more depressing than anything else.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,Nintendo Gamer,38,Its well intentioned but underfunded. [Christmas 2009 p.64]
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GamesRadar+,30,Avoid this one like the glowing radioactive ooze that it is.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,PTGamers,40,And to finish it off this game is just awful. That’s a shame really since I had hoped it would turn out acceptable.
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpy,37,The fighting system found within Shifters is guaranteed to make just about anyone cringe. Calling it simple is a horrid understatement.
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Nintendo Gamer,33,This strives for nothing and doesnt even make it that far. A poor game for a poor franchise. [JPN Import; Aug 2007 p.54]
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,35,Quantum Theory can hardly be congratulated for infringing on other games as it is hardly even capable of doing that properly. Albeit all attempts to be Gears of War Quantum Theory is no more fun than burning $60 dollars and to be honest burning money isnt exactly a lucrative or entertaining hobby.
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Games Radar,50,If youre likely to be amused by the puerile humour youll find this mildly diverting and entertaining otherwise avoid - this is a genre thats overpopulated and there are far better examples than this.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,DailyGame,40,Its just a waste of a strong license. I really hope Chuck Palahniuk the author of the book this mess is based upon had nothing to do with oking this game. Avoid at all costs even if its in the discount bin.
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Multiplayer.it,40,Agony represents everything that a horror videogame should never become.
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Worth Playing,33,Crash Boom Bang is a mess. There are too many unneeded features not enough time was spent developing the important ones and hundreds of small hiccups and issues make this game feel like it should have gone through more inspections at every level of design.
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpy,35,A hack-and-slash fest in its most basic embarrassing form -- and faulty at that.
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,1UP,35,From looking at it youd probably never guess it was an Unreal Engine game. It lacks any real distinguishing features struggles to run smoothly in places and aside from a few nice special effects never remotely approaches the expected visual impact.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,MondoXbox,35,A very poorly produced game with too many problems to be even considered as a possibile buy.
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,Hot Games,40,Theres so much more wrong with the game (especially the lack of multi-player and password save system – would a battery have cost that much?) that even the great sound and mediocre game play are swallowed up by this product.
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,DualShockers,35,I’d stay as far away from Left Alive as possible. For all of you hardcore Front Mission fans hoping for a proper sequel in the series you can bury those hopes and dreams. With a team consisting of so much talent behind it I truly wonder what went wrong with Left Alive. I love Square Enix games to death typically but this is frankly unacceptable…and it’s $60.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Cheat Code Central,40,Dont confuse this game with the console games however. Console games good; GBA game bad.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Giant Bomb,40,A game with no originality and not much excitement either.
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,Eurogamer Italy,40,Unfortunately the game is an unrefined mess full of bugs framerate drops and bad physics. It’s more a puzzle-platformer with stealth and some basic rpg elements instead of an rpg dungeon crawler and it’s not so immersive and free as the developers think. Maybe it will be improved in fact the graphic it’s good and so the locations design but right now it’s not the spiritual successor that backers deserved.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Nintendo Gamer,37,The presentations pretty ropey too. [Dec 2008 p.76]
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,IGN,35,Ready 2 Rumble Revolution isnt one of the worst looking games on the Wii but it certainly is one of the worst playing games on the system.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Gaming Age,33,The game is a mess from the opening bell to the K.O. punch. As for differences between the two versions nothing was touched up for the Xbox version and both games are virtually identical.
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Hobby Consolas,30,Based on classic RPGs such as Eye of the Beholder Crystal Rift feels like a poor adaptation. Dungeons are repetitive graphics are too basic and it causes dizziness when played with PSVR due to camera controls.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,Quandary,30,All up Cypher was disappointing. But I did feel a sense of accomplishment when I had finished albeit with some help.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Definitely not worth the ridiculous 800 MP asking price. [Aug 2008 p.94]
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameBrink,39,It’s a boring ugly game with complicated controls and a B-Flick storyline. Who can’t wait for the US release!? [JPN Import]
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameSpy,40,The party mentioned in the title is a very short one and players will likely decide to leave it early to knock on other doors: Rayman: Raving Rabbids and Wario Ware offer much more fun for only slightly more cash.
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,31,While you can teach an old dog new tricks its still a dog. [Nov 2011 p.95]
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gamers' Temple,35,Lucha Fury could be a decent brawler but the fun in its gameplay is brought down greatly by its bad controls.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,GameSpot,30,Not counting massively multiplayer delivery quests my top benchmark for delivery-style games is still Choplifter. Fluster Cluck can be found at the opposite end of that spectrum.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,All Game Guide,40,Unfortunately these real-world feelings are nothing more than lapses in programming in this action/simulation.
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Worth Playing,35,Past Cure is many things: technically infuriating a slog and thematically inconsistent. While one can appreciate the effort of a small team trying to craft a game that does many things it cant seem to do any of them well enough to warrant any attention. With a glut of better games that tackle similar elements on the platform its very difficult to recommend Past Cure to people even as a quick diversion.
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,Eurogamer Italy,40,Filling the narrative gap between the two main chapters sounds original but the game completely fails. Ignition is a faux pas in Dead Space universe with annoying gameplay and horrible graphics: an experience you can easily and definitely avoid.
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,GameZone,38,If you must play Pimp My Ride try the 360 version. Play this version and you’ll put yourself through a lot of unnecessary frustration.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Thunderbolt,30,A bad game. You might assume that a company as reputable as the History Channel might take more care to protect their license but its clear that they just wanted to make a quick buck.
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Eurogamer,40,While Sniper: Art of Victory is superior to its brother in arms and the sniping mechanic itself is reasonably well implemented there are still too many flaws here to recommend it.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Game Over Online,40,Its something youll play for a little while but youll soon realize that watching the real thing is far more exciting. It sounds better. It feels faster. And youll get to see the podium and hear the anthem of the victors nation.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,Absolute Games,30,Darkstar made me feel like a time traveler. It is as if at the end of the last century fearing the 2K error apocalypse someone put this game in a capsule and only now a team of archaeologists has unearthed these artifact CDs.
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Destructoid,30,A nostalgic joke taken too far. Though there are postivies in the presentation the gameplay is laborious even draining. Shaq Fu outstays its welcome despite its meagre run-time which is far more offensive than its juvenile attempts at edgy comedy. Shaq shouldve known better than to put his name to this and everyone shouldve known better than to put money into its creation.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Nintendophiles,37,Meant as a game to ease beginners into this type of stealth genre. The way it does that ends up being condescending for experienced gamers and for beginners will be annoying due to AI glitches.
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,IGN,35,Kung Fu Rider is not a good game. The controls are terribly unresponsive the game punishes players unfairly and the level design is repetitive.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,4Players.de,40,Yes it is playable. And some dribbling looks decent. But if youre looking for the next generation of basketball this is not it.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Areajugones,35,Coffin Dodgers fails in all possible ways: gameplay game modes tracks… Its nonexistent variety and its simple gameplay are the burdens of a game that had good potential.
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GamingXP,40,I have no idea why such crimes against gamedom even get published. Simple advice: hands off! Well at least the sound is good.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,PSM Magazine,30,The gameplay is similar to the PS3 version--but with a static camera limited hero skills boss fights that drag across multiple levels and mediocre PS2 graphics the end result is an irritating mess of pointless repetition. [Sept 2007 p.84]
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpot,35,This third-person shooter is a trip into hell.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,1UP,35,The Shield is too little too late; what wouldve been a merely mediocre license tie-in is now due to its very late birth simply a bad game.
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpy,30,Its out and it costs money despite being far from ready for prime time. Even as a quirky indie release with a budget price Orion asks for too big a leap of faith that itll eventually work out.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Eurogamer Italy,40,Porting an adventure game onto a console system is always a risk: Dream Chronicles offers a boring gameplay poor enigmas and most of all a frustrating pixel hunting from the beginning to the end. Needless to say youll miss your PC mouse a lot.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,GamingExcellence,40,Wasted potential is all I see here but the lack of quality in Power Gig doesnt make it any easier to see anything more. It simply isnt worth it for the guitar nor the game: buy a cheap Six String if you want to learn the strings leave this title alone.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Game Chronicles,26,Sadly the sound is the best part of Air Conflicts but who really cares about sound when the game looks below average and is virtually unplayable.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,TeamXbox,34,The outdated and unfunny jokes horrible fighting engine and lackluster visuals and sound make this a game that could have been but never will. Stay very far away.
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Play Magazine,40,Why does the house of Metal Gear Z.O.E. Contra Silent Hill and Castlevania need to bestow upon us such mediocre kiddy fare as this? [Jan 2003 p.81]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,Cheat Code Central,40,First generation cell-phone games had more interesting gameplay.
Hollow,Switch,Feb-22-2018,MMEU,Action Adventure | Survival,Nintendo Life,30,Hollow is an incredibly ugly game with the kind of plentiful technical issues that make it actively difficult to play. Those with a masochistic streak might derive some pleasure from its abrasiveness and its downbeat tone but most Switch-owning horror fans would be much better served playing through Resident Evil Revelations and its sequel for the umpteenth time.
Legends of Pegasus,PC,Aug-10-2012,Kalypso | Novacore Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | 4X,GameSpot,40,Legends of Pegasus had a grand plan but developer Novacore didnt come close to pulling off what it set out to do. Like storied Bellerophon its hubris has proved its ultimate undoing.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,Xbox 360,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Cheat Code Central,38,There are songs to play you cant get anywhere else but you should really ask yourself if you to play them on a real-fake guitar.
Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,InsideGamer.nl,35,Damnation sucks at every front. The futuristic cowboy setting is lame the shootouts are boring and the story is just stupid. Damnation will ruin your day your marriage and even your life.
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,40,Alekhine’s Gun is a title where the ambition of design outmatches the execution with gusto.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Electronic Gaming Monthly,30,Just too troubled to even bother renting. [May 2002 p.112]
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,IGN,33,Its a slow-paced shooter with shoddy AI dated graphics and a frustrating design. Even though its good for a few irreverent laughs its not worth paying for even in the bargain bin.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,GameWatcher,30,Umbrella Corps is a big game from a major publisher in a popular franchise in that franchise’s anniversary year and it’s both awful and dead on arrival. Now I see why Capcom didn’t tell anyone that it came out.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,PSX-Sense.nl,35,This should never have come out on PS3 as evidenced by a sh.tload of technical issues. If you absolutely want this at best mediocre experience we advise you go for the PC version.
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,Console Monster,33,The game is lifeless dull and has no real goals. You can dodge your way to victory by dodging this one.
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,FNintendo,30,Arc of Alchemist does one thing right: it looks like a charm. It certainly doesnt play like one though and its performance is anything but enjoyable not to mention a dull and drab plot and characters that will leave any player disenchanted with any hint of joy that its visual environment might suggest.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,AceGamez,40,With such a poor fighting engine youre going to get bored very quickly; tapping on one button isnt going to please most fighting fans.
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Wccftech,35,Eternity: The Last Unicorn is a less-than-magical mix of misplaced PS1-era nostalgia and shallow Dark Souls mimicry. Nearly everything about the game from its fixed camera angles to its clunky combat to its copious backtracking is broken or irritating in some way. If challenge is all you’re looking for in a game perhaps Eternity: The Last Unicorn is for you. Everyone else will likely find it as fun as a sharpened horn to the eye.
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,Push Square,30,Tokyo Tattoo Girls is a simple strategy game which can be fun in small doses but is sadly not interesting enough to keep you playing for long. The story is poor the characters are strange (and not in a good way) and the gameplay is lacking. The artwork and tattoos look gorgeous so it’s a pity they weren’t in a better game.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Jeuxvideo.com,35,One Piece: Grand Cruise is certainly a pretty game but there’s nothing much to do in its big world. Nothing fun in any case. It’s a boring short and annoying game that hurts the One Piece franchise.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameSpot,35,If you live a life of sin and gluttony Infernal will be waiting for you in the afterlife.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer's Pulse,34,Underachieves in all aspects of game design. The level design and gameplay are boring unimaginative and repetitive.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,Zentendo,40,Sub-par gameplay with almost unbearable controls. Boring uninspired content from missions to visuals to the audio work. Not even hardcore fans of the show should spend more money than a rental on this sucker.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,IGN,36,Theres a lot of utterly stupid crap in Bad Boys: Miami Takedown and yet its kind of enjoyable in an I love watching car wrecks kind of way.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,TotalGames.net,40,Its just plain bad. Whats worse is that either the developer or the publisher is fully aware of how atrocious Rise Of The Machines is. This is of course complete speculation but...
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,AceGamez,40,Kids arent going to want to rescue the bad guys of the movie kids want to explore the factory swim in the chocolate lakes and hijack cars.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,GameSpot,35,The Nintendo DS rendition of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a short collection of generic levels that hardly relate to the movie at all.
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,Official Xbox Magazine,35,As a pre-order freebie Ignition isnt bad but it isnt worth paying for or playing through otherwise. [Jan 2011 p.69]
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,IGN Spain,36,7 Days to Die tries hard to provide the same experience we had on PC but it fails in its attempt due to the controller adaptation and the visible graphical downgrade.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameShark,30,Heck even the character select screen looks boring. When you get to the game the drab color selection and lack of anything truly new will bore you to tears.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Zentendo,30,George of the Jungle may be aimed at young children and their requirements may be different from that of a videogame reviewer but this is just nothing more than sloppy.
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,35,Even if you were completely charmed by Philip Pullmans work or enjoyed the movie adaptation theres absolutely no reason to give this game a try. Even the music as pretty as it is cant redeem such poor gameplay and atrocious presentation.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,A completely unremarkable WWII shooter with more bugs than Pixars second feature film. Theres nothing offensive about it its just subpar in every possible way from AI to controls to visuals to voice acting. Feels like a launch window 360 game.
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,Cheat Code Central,44,Terrible. There is a split-screen multiplayer option but I cant imagine anyone whod want to participate and why would they? Sluggish controls poor attention to detail lack of customization and unbalanced difficulty all makes Showtime Championship Boxing a dud.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,GameSpot,34,Unless you want to spend $20 to be bored to tears you should stay away from Street Jam Basketball.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Gamenikki,30,To put it simply its nearly impossible to enjoy Bad Boys: Miami Takedown without being completely naive. The presentation game play and voice acting are all about 10 years behind its a sad state of affairs.
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,Games Master UK,34,A point-n-click with minimal pointing and telegraphed clicking. NCIS fan? Still avoid this. [Feb 2012 p.98]
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Multiplayer.it,30,Its better to avoid Merchants of Brooklyn. Its price is something out of mind when youll start to see its gameplay contents and the low level of technology of this game.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Chronicles,40,Just too little and far too late. The WWII genre isn’t exactly short on titles these days nor is the FPS genre. If you plan on releasing a game in either (and especially both) you had better bring your A game.
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,DarkZero,30,Thanks to Street Fighter IV’s rebirth of the genre there is now a wealth of options to pick from when it comes to fighting games so there are no reasons to buy the generic sounding Girl Fight because this is a bad budget fighter with no redeeming qualities to enjoy.
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,GamesRadar+,30,Ultimately Valhalla Knight: Eldar Saga suffers from an overall lack of polish as well as being an all-around boring game. Only those starved for an action RPG should think of treading the lands of Eldar. Everyone else need not apply.
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,Hardcore Gamer,30,Outside of the cheese factor everything here is just dull. Loads of banal conversations wooden acting and obvious advice abound for every one moment you can laugh over Richard deciding to grab a girl’s rear end in what can only be described as a video game in the loosest sense of the term. This might be a weird thing to hear from a critic but just wait for the highlights to go up on YouTube instead. You’ll get the same chuckle-worthy stupidity and save some money in the process. It’s a game about being a pick-up artist that you should in no way consider picking up.
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Game Over Online,32,Fugitive Hunter seems to utilize random nonsensical damage instead of the target specific kind and the game’s defamation of the law of physics and its shoddy collision detection makes it seem like you’re constantly trekking through Jello. All that and no multiplayer. Bummer.
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Eurogamer,30,The results feel neutered and unfinished.
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,32,Ugly unplayable and not even close to being fun. [Nov 2007 p.92]
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Brash Games,30,This is not the worst game but when there’s so much better out there there really is no reason to play it.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Play UK,32,Shellshock 2 combines technical inferiority as a shooter with a woeful attempt at survival horror. It’s kicked around and stomped to death by Call Of Duty and Silent Hill in their respective genres and is thus left as an entirely useless exercise in gaming terms.
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Vandal,40,The ideas are good but not their implementation. There are some serious issues when it comes to the difficulty and level design that sadly ruin the general experience.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,GameStar,32,Quotation forthcoming.
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,Computer Games Magazine,30,You are apt to play the same segments over and over ad nauseam. Perhaps a more appropriate title might have been Groundhog Day II.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Machinima,30,The controls are clunky the graphics are student project-basic the plot isnt worth discussing and the levels so repetitive youll have seen all it has to offer within half an hour.
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GamerWeb Nintendo,35,Its presentation is laughable to the point where it probably would have been unimpressive even on the Game Boy Color.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameSpot,25,Stupid AI and sluggish performance are just two of the many problems that plague Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops.
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,Multiplayer.it,30,Financial issues killed an old-school promising shooter in its own cradle.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,My Gamer,32,Unless something drastic happens to the series perhaps THQ is better putting this old dog down.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PSX-Sense.nl,30,What could have been a great game has turned out to be the exact opposite: a rushed effort supported with ugly graphics and boring gameplay. Granted Michael Rooker and Norman Reedus voice acting is pitch perfect but thats hardly worth spending fifty dollars for... isnt it?
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,MondoXbox,40,Past Cure shows a lot of love for specific video games and movies with a huge ambition to emulate them but the developers fell incredibly short of their target producing a very troubled game in pretty much every aspect except for the soundtrack.
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,Console Gameworld,38,Its an extremely challenging set of minigames based on the most unlikely movie tie-in ever; give it a pass unless youre as calm patient and wise as Morgan Freeman.
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,TheXboxHub,30,In many ways Agony delivers an authentic experience of the archaic interpretation of ‘Hell’. Playing this game feels like torture an exercise in utter tedium as you perform the same tasks and witness the same ‘gruesome’ scenes. Unfortunately I don’t think it’s that meta it simply tries too hard. Squandering any potential it might’ve had the result is a shallow monotonous experience that’s not worth your time.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Multiplayer.it,35,After the fairly good on-rail shooter released last year the Transformers come back on Wii and this time around they cant actually transform. However thats not the major problem. Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition is in fact a poorly executed action game with cumbersome controls repetitive action and a very short single player campaign.
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,Worth Playing,40,The stylish storytelling and the possibilities posed by the setting cant hide the embarrassing localization the unexciting fetch-the-key gameplay that most every other FPS has moved beyond and issues with the graphics that might have you reaching for the nearest bottle of pain relievers and asking what happened to quality testing.
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,SpazioGames,40,Poor playability a complete lack of I.A. and bad graphics spoil the chance for another good Astro Boy title. The fan should forget this one and stick to the old Segas Omega Factor.
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,Gamezilla!,30,This game has less to see than most budget titles I’ve seen and it still carries a top shelf price tag.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Switch Player,40,Fantasy Hero Unsigned Legacy should be an additive title with plenty to keep you coming back for countless hours. Sadly problems throughout the title make this a hard one to love. You may find some enjoyment but it likely wont be worth the trouble.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Digital Entertainment News,30,The Shield in the end is a game that will only appeal to the true hardcore fans. If you love the TV series rent it otherwise take a pass.
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,35,For a game that plays up its characters’ sex appeal Girl Fight is stupefyingly unattractive. The character models look like last-gen remnants and their complete lack of personality and combat pizazz makes them utterly forgettable.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,GameSpy,30,While all of this good on paper the game fails miserably when it comes to execution. Simply put Evil Prophecy just isnt any fun.
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,Cheat Code Central,30,Fails on so many levels. It looks bad the control system suffers from lag and ineffective weapon designs the AI is incredibly unbalanced and the missions are a repetitive mix of elements.
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,Game Informer,33,Tears of joy rolled down my cheeks at the exact moment that I ejected this game from my Xbox. I then proceeded to toss it on the floor and violently smash it with a sledgehamer into a thousand little pieces. [Jan 2003 p.114]
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Digital Chumps,30,Its hard to watch a game stumble with every step but AMY repeatedly demolishes any reason to suspect Occams razor shouldnt be employed; its a dreadful game and a miserable experience.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Destructoid,30,The game never really takes off relying on very few tricks to support itself from beginning to end.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,GameSpot,23,Superman Returns for the DS is a terrible game for numerous reasons.
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,Total PC Gaming,30,A haven for low-resolution textures a lack of modern graphical technology frequent clipping issues and camera angles that pan into walls and obstruct your view. [Issue#10 p.56]
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,PSM Magazine,30,A collection of terribly constructed animations horribly limited replay and a create-a-boxer mode thats shallower than it first seems. [Sept 2002 p.31]
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,4Players.de,34,I wouldn’t have missed a thing if this game would have stayed away from consoles. This is just a boring technically absolutely unimpressive simulation that fails at the only thing it should rather do well: Simulate.
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,Multiplayer.it,30,You can (barely) fathom some good ideas about offering the players more accessibility in a saga that surely needed some but they soon get lost in the utter and complete mess of unfinished mechanics and bugs that sadly is X Rebirth.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,Metro GameCentral,30,The developer’s love for Resident Evil and old school survival horror is obvious but this poorly made homage does nobody any favours.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,Cinescape,25,Unfortunately the graphics are simply horrible. The entire game lacks any real pizzazz and the entire game feels lifeless.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,NintendoWorldReport,30,An insult to gamers and anime fans alike. With its charismatic cast and open-ended special-agent plot device Yu Yu Hakusho is a prime franchise for videogames but judging from this rush job the developer and publisher don’t seem to recognize this.
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Computer Games Magazine,30,There is a nice mix of unit types including heroes and the game even gives you spells to cast but the AI is so poor and the presentation so lazy youd be much better off buying the boardgame from an import store.
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,Gamezilla!,35,For the love of all that is holy stay away from this game it’s one of the worst examples of use of license out there.
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Gameblog.fr,30,Call of Duty Black Ops: Declassified has only its name going for it. Everything else is piss poor from both design and production standpoints.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,IGN,30,If youre looking for a slow moving game with sub-par graphics poor gameplay and horrible controls then Mistmare is the game for you.
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameShark,30,Oh my god. I thought the Game.com version of Mortal Kombat was bad. That cant hold a torch to this log.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,IGN,32,Crossfire simply fails to do the one thing it has to do and thats to entertain. It takes archaic forms of gameplay and tries to update them for the next-generation but fails in almost every respect.
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,DarkZero,30,If only some time and effort went into creating what could be an enjoyable romp. As it turns out this reeks of disappointment.
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,IGN,35,Yes it’s one of the worst games on Wii as far as tech goes and yeah there are countless other light gun experiences out there that’ll destroy this one in terms of pure gameplay but damn if this isn’t fun in its own seriously crippled way.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PC Format,32,A PS2 port when theres an Xbox 360 version? This is a dreadful example of shameless corner cutting and an awful game. [Aug 2008 p.107]
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamePen,30,And as if uninspired gameplay wasn’t enough the game is chock full of the dandiest bugs this side of my bathtub. Let’s see - where to begin. Clipping bad frame rates stuck fighters horrid camera movement moves that just don’t work and sluggish controls.
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Hooked Gamers,35,Rekoil is an uninspired first-person shooter that fails to deliver on any of its promise.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,COGconnected,35,Even if you can get past the poor humour and lack of story the controls and combat just feel bad.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,PSX Extreme,28,Women’s Volleyball Championship doesn’t do anything right. It does however fail miserably in a variety of different areas and remains mediocre in the aspects where it’s not a total failure.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,TotalPlayStation,33,But if you’re looking for a poorly-assembled gimmick of a game that serves as a friendly reminder of the good ol’ Celebrity Deathmatch days on MTV all for a discounted price of $19.99 then CD just might be for you. If you’re not looking for authenticity though stay far far away from this one.
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,ZTGD,30,Yes the game was finally starting to grab me ever so slightly and then it just sort of ends. It makes me wonder if the game was even finished or they just decided to wrap up and release.
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,TeamXbox,31,Only the undead could enjoy a game filled with numerous glitches and a sincere lack of creativity across the board. Avoid this title like a flesh-eating zombie unless of course you just have to have all things Romero in your collection.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,Game Informer,20,While playing through Escape Dead Island I was continually offended that anyone would be asked to pay for this experience. Any number of developmental issues could have caused this train wreck from budgetary problems or creative crises and well likely never know the whole truth. But as it stands Escape Dead Island is worth nobodys time.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,XGN,30,Sonic Boom Rise of Lyric is a real disappointment for Sonic fans. There is basically nothing positive to say about this game. Sonic deserves much better.
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Xbox Tavern,35,Gene Rain is a complete waste of storage space. The game’s nonsensical and incoherent story confusingly bounces around like flubber in a basketball court. It doesn’t help that the voice acting is the worst I’ve heard since the original Resident Evil. Grouping that with the game’s sluggish controls its bland locations and its lack of originality collectively makes for one of the worst cover-shooters this gen.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,A promising concept is steamrollered in a game that doesnt really work as a platformer and breaks down entirely as a racer. Wed rather be kicked in the shins for eight hours than play this again.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,DailyGame,30,The game is easy shallow and repetitive. Stop reading this and buy Brain Age. Your brain will thank you.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Polygon,30,The tide has begun to turn for licensed games thanks to great efforts like those from Telltale Rocksteadys Batman franchise and others. The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is the exact sort of lazy cheap cash-grab that gave licensed games a bad name in the first place. To put a slightly less nostalgic twist on an old cliche: They dont make em like this anymore.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,21,A game that simply attempts to cash in on the success of Counter-Strike and the Rainbow Six series by copying their themes but it ends up falling well short of the mark because of its terrible graphics engine its ill-conceived design and a campaign that takes only a few hours to (nearly) complete.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Meristation,30,A shooting game that fails to understand how a Shootem Up works. If you fail with the most basic core of your game mechanic it says enough about your game.
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,AceGamez,30,The developers of Jenga World Tour have done pretty much all they can to make the game reach its full potential - its just that it never had much to work with. Single cartridge multiplayer would have helped a great deal but even that wouldnt have lifted it into the average category.
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,The core fighting system is designed well enough but the Kinect control is lazily implemented and theres absolutely no variety to the fights. [Issue#66 p.93]
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,The biggest challenge is dealing with the wonky physics. [May 2007 p.114]
Coliseum,PC,Jan-6-2004,Stormcloud Creations,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing,GameSpot,38,Surprisingly dull and is lacking in both personality and depth...Sloppy shallow and ultimately forgettable the game never lives up to its undeniably catchy concept.
Kabuki Warriors,Xbox,Nov-19-2001,Light Weight,Action | Fighting | 2D,XenGamers,25,There are much better things to spend one’s money on. Like root canals.
Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,IGN,24,The game is about on par with a chop-shop web game and does very little to use the Wii controls at all.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Joystiq,30,Unlike Deadly Premonition Earth Defense Force 2025 or other games that hide genuine depth behind an awkward presentation Magus has no hidden quality charm or saving grace. Its entirely witless and none of its mechanics strive for anything beyond mediocrity. Despite its issues though Magus is surprisingly breezy to play.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,4Players.de,28,Games like this are the reason why movie tie-ins have a bad reputation. Technically sound but otherwise redundant boring and worse than the 2011 game Sanctum of Slime while totally overpriced even the multiplayer aspect cannot save anything.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GamePro,30,A game that’s awful in every respect and will ultimately be a textbook example of a wasted license.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Cheat Code Central,30,Avoid this one like the Black Plague.
Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GamesRadar+,30,We can definitely see aspirations of greatness here so its too bad Toy Shop is so unpolished overall.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,ZTGD,30,With its dodgy controls and dull combat it is hard to recommend this game to anybody even a real retro brawler fan.
