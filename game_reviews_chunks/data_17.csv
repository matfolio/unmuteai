Call of Juarez: The Cartel,PlayStation 3,Jul-19-2011,Techland,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameFocus,51,What I played this last week was one of the least enjoyable video game experiences Ive ever had and I would be extremely surprised if there were to be a fourth game in this franchise. Not only is the game full of miserable characters its also lacking the polish consumers should expect of a finished game.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,Eurogamer,50,Its competent. Solid. Inoffensive. Somewhere down the line DnS Development got mired in the details and neglected to inject the spark necessary to make the run-and-gun fun.
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,games(TM),60,Lets hope Namco has a patch in the pipeline. [June 2008 p.124]
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Gaming Nexus,65,Infinity Runner does provide a few moments of intense fun. Unfortunately those moments are broken up too often with gameplay choices that really bring the game (and the fun) to a screeching halt.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameZone,58,Unforgiving AI lack of play options to customize your game and the annoying fact that you can’t restart a race during a championship really can make the game more aggravating than enjoyable.
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,PlayStation Country,60,I find Generation Zero to have an interesting stealthy core that sadly is undermined by a somewhat empty world. The technical issues might lead some to hold off and I do hope Avalanche keep supporting this blueprint. There is an appeal to this that does want me to return providing something more is on the horizon.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Next Level Gaming,50,The problem is that they failed at making either the storyline or the action engaging and fun.
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,IGN,45,Mixing a ton of casino games into one package and then tying a goal-based story around it certainly works on paper but when you use low-budget implementations of each and every game to put it together the whole thing falls apart.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GamingXP,65,Generally Hyperdimension Neptunia is certainly not the worst RPG on the PS3. However in order to be included in the major leagues the game lacks a lot.
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,60,Supermassive Games delivers an unimpressive on-rail shooter with some light co-op tactical features.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gameplanet,45,Rodea the Sky Soldier has the odd interesting idea but numerous gameplay problems betray its troubled development.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Next Level Gaming,54,There are better puzzle games out there and games that do not pretend to be something they are not.
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,GameZone,55,Thanks to its many glaring flaws such as awful camera and awkward combat controls Catwoman isn’t much fun to play even with the cool feline abilities.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpy,63,Superempire put in a password save system for EWJ2 but sadly it bites!
Shadow the Hedgehog,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2005,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cheat Code Central,50,Unlike last years popular and more importantly playable Sonic Heroes Shadow The Hedgehog is a misstep in almost every direction.
Crash: Mind Over Mutant,DS,Oct-7-2008,TOSE,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GamingTrend,57,I understand that Crash: Mind Over Mutant is good on the consoles. Not great but good. It seems that a little more time and effort could have gone into the DS version and it makes me sad.
Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpot,55,This arcade game is relatively shallow and a pale imitation of its television inspiration.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Hardcore Gamer,60,Fans have waited a long time for Rodea the Sky Soldier but unfortunately the final experience never comes within range of Yuji Naka’s past masterpieces.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,GameFocus,59,Warriors: Legends of Troy is a nice change of pace from other Warrior-type games published by Tecmo-Koei. Unfortunately it still is hampered by a lot of problems.
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,TeamXbox,65,A decent physics and handling model not to mention a solid damage model.
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamerNode,55,The concept is intriguing and the game worlds can be very immersive but the execution in Darkest of Days falls short of its potential amid control AI and other gameplay issues.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer.no,60,This is pretty much a low-budget version of Gears of War but enjoyable enough for what it is. Only buy if you can play in coop mode with real human beings though because the AI of your squad mates is just dreadful.
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Da Gameboyz,65,On the one hand the bare bones of the game are there the potential is there and I wouldnt trust many devs outside of Kerberos to patch this to a decent state. On the other regardless its going to take at least a few months to patch it to a state where its not just sort of playable its actually enjoyable. But if you feel like helping nurture a game to completion by all means fork out. Those of you who are more cautious hang back a few months it should be cool by then.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,53,The forced or rushed feeling of this title just weighs too heavy on me. And with the lacking graphics and clunky gameplay this title just fails on all levels.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Meristation,50,Watchmen: The end is Nigh Part 2 is essentially the same game. Three new levels but the same characters the same moves and the same price. Not worth on its own better on the retail disc version along with Part 1.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,JeuxActu,50,Completed in under 5 hours with sloppy gameplay and no challenge whatsoever Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan looks more like a merchandising product for the movie than a real thought-out game.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameBiz,54,The game falls short most obviously in the gameplay with its bland and linear levels and large amount of backtracking used only as an attempt to make the game longer although it’s still only around five hours long.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,TotalGames.net,50,A dreadfully wasted opportunity - especially when it looks so good.
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,Sports Gaming Network,60,NHN isnt terrible but it isnt close to being a great game either. Casual hockey fans shouldnt bother with National Hockey Night and for the hardcore hockey fan this game is a rental at best.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameFocus,58,Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part 2 (and Part 1) could only be enjoyed by fans of either the book or movie. I don’t see how someone who isn’t remotely knowledgeable of Watchmen could enjoy these games especially Part 2.
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Cheat Code Central,46,If Hummer Badlands were an actual arcade game it would make on average about a quarter an hour. Its just too easy.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Gamezilla!,50,Its just passable really but I dont think Master Splinter would approve wholeheartedly even with a decent price point of $20.
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GameZone,60,Theres not much more to say. Pass on this one unless you are the most hardcore of RPG players. Even then stop and reassess if youre really sure about this. Maybe go for a walk and clear your head. If youre still determined have at it. You are one of the special few.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Multiplayer.it,50,Chronovolt is buggy slow-paced and jerky in terms of frame rate. There are many action puzzles better than this on mobile devices.
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Game Chronicles,70,At a cost of $10 Ryder White hardly breaks the bank but there are some really great titles to be found for that same cash. This one is necessary only for serious fans of Dead Island.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Hot Games,60,It’s not awful and is in fact a solid platform game but it can be annoying and even worse pretty boring at times.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Worth Playing,56,The frustrating ease of death an uninteresting story and characters washed-out visuals and uninspired gameplay do not a successful sequel make.
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpace,50,AeternoBlade 2 is a continuance of AeternoBlade an action time-puzzler by CORECELL Technology. This action-puzzle game implements multiple styles of combat with an interesting time manipulation mechanic. While the puzzles are mostly enjoyable the combat is largely uninspired leading to tedious boss encounters and aggravating 3D battles that quickly neutralizes the fantastic points of AeternoBlade 2s design.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,GameGrin,45,A basic action adventure game with a great style and a surprisingly engrossing story that is sadly backed up by repetitive gameplay that never evolves into something great.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,Play.tm,55,Unfortunately the main gimmick of the game is pointless at best and frustrating at worst. There are challenge modes available after the game is completed and extra costumes to unlock but nothing to offer real replay value.
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,IGN,50,Overall this is a functional but unexciting trip to the races. Also it isnt exactly easy on the eyes.
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,IGN,45,Mixing a ton of casino games into one package and then tying a goal-based story around it certainly works on paper but when you use low-budget implementations of each and every game to put it together the whole thing falls apart.
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Vandal,45,Bubsy hasnt improved much in all these years. Its short not very well designed and the main character doesnt have much charisma. With so many options in the market right now its hard to recommend Bubsys new adventure.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameTrailers,54,EAs Harry Potter series unceremoniously bows out in this final game. While the previous games were also disappointments this one sinks even lower to full-on cash-in status. What youre left with is a confused mess parading around as a barely-competent third-person shooter.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Game Chronicles,50,A decent game. It has several features and modes that I enjoyed. I particularly liked the soundtrack and the sound effects. I did like the Shipyard the most out of the entire game. Sadly the voice acting could have be a LOT better.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,Console Monster,68,Fun to pick up and play Easy to learn.
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,GameSpy,60,Due to the games poorly crafted A.I. this isnt really a game to play alone. Much like actual paintball Splat Magazine Renegade Paintball just isnt any fun without some friends.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,IGN,55,THQs low-budget truck driving game mixes tried-and-true arcade truck driving with a colorful cast of characters country-flavored humor and a whole lot of gigantic boobery. Its very light-hearted fun for a very short period of time.
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,MS Xbox World,55,That being said though judging the game on its own grounds Koei have never failed to populate the series with its many options and the tradition continues here this is something definitely shedding fifteen or so pound for the Playstation 2 but to pay an extra ten or so on top for the Xbox 360 is hardly justifiable.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,59,Dont expect anything taxing but theres just enough content to make this a worthwhile multiplayer title for the younger gamer. [Aug 2008 p.62]
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,RPG Fan,57,There was nothing fun enjoyable or remotely redeeming about this game at all. The experience was akin to having a root canal.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Activisions Transformers adaptations shed a little more charm and fascination each time they transform. This super-lean take feels like the last OK offering before the rot truly sets in.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,PSX Nation,60,The story is cute but nothing really deep and basically just has you playing the various types of Tetris included to move the story along.
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,Daily Radar,50,An improved version of last years disaster is still not worth the having.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,CGMagazine,60,The game despite its problems can be fun in small doses and certainly provides plenty of old school challenge.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Eurogamer Portugal,60,Sacred 3 - Titan Lords is a game with an interesting story and a world that although huge is accessible and easy to remember. However it becomes extremely difficult to concentrate on the game with such a poor combat since most of the game consists of fighting.
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Xbox World Australia,52,The game is plagued by faults in the control setup and AI deficiencies as well as a limited online modes.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,55,The technical ambition is overcome by nonsensical design and a general lack of creativity.
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,NintendoWorldReport,50,All in all the games okay but feels thrown together.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,Vandal,50,There are some great ideas and some good moments in Husk but gameplay-wise the experience isnt that good and sadly it isnt what you would expect. The developers have promised to listen to the feedback and improve the game so keep an eye on it because even if now it isnt the game we want it could end up being it.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,GamingXP,58,Naughty Bear received a 50% rating and since Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise offers more kills more teddys and a lot of crazy outfits we orient ourselves to the top but nonetheless the game cant escape mediocrity.
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,45,Johnny Kung Fus biggest crimes are likely frustrating difficulty and poor pacing.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,Da Gameboyz,50,There is no doubt that FunTown Mahjong is what it is a virtual version of 16-tile mahjong. Where my issues lie with the game is that the tutorial is not nearly as helpful as it could have been the graphics are somewhat average and the gameplay itself is not nearly what I expected.
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,DarkZero,50,To sum up then this is an interesting game in the same way that Earth Defence Force is interesting. It’s full of silly faults but if you look past them it’s fairly competent.
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,GameSpy,50,Character choices aside if you can get past the occasionally spotty controls and the somewhat sluggish combat youll have a decent time with this game especially if you grew up watching Godzilla and King Ghidorah duke it out on Saturday afternoon TV. Just dont set your expectations too high.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,56,You can blast through the game on the lower difficulty in less than day. You will notice the title says: Beowulf: The Game. Thats to distinguish it from the ancient manuscript. I tend to think of it as a disclaimer or quite possibly a warning.
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,AceGamez,70,If you can get past the technical issues Neverend is a very good entry in the RPG/Adventure genre thats best suited for those who play games to experience new worlds not new technology.
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Game Informer,73,The environments are huge but they dont totally make up for Jonnys lack of multiplayer. [Apr 2002 p.77]
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,GameSpot,55,Street Trace: NYC provides a few moments of multiplayer amusement but it doesnt have enough going for it to be compelling for long.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Games Master UK,52,A game that just cant keep up with Clancys ever-evolving war zone. [July 2006 p.80]
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,games(TM),50,This has little of the charm that make its games so enticing nor does it offer much in the way of entrancing solitude. [Issue#180 p.48]
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,50,I would recommend checking out a walkthrough just to get to the first mission because if I didnt have to review this game the disk would have ended up smashed on the other side of my office in the first fifteen minutes.
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gamer Limit,50,C.O.R.E. borrows a lot of mechanics from other first person shooters and brings a whole lot of issues along for the ride.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,Play Magazine,58,Though the seamless integration of action puzzles and even a tad of platforming is pulled off well the package its presented in is rather unappealing. [Nov 2003 p.101]
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,GameSpot,49,Not a good game. It takes the primary elements of the Pern novels and uses them to fashion a run-of-the-mill adventure game that offers very little actual adventure and too many frustrating mechanical issues.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,GameSpot,45,Enough effort was put into the gameplay and graphical design to keep it from crashing and burning but not enough to inject it with any sort of life or appeal.
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,GameSpy,60,All of the elements were there to make this an addictive and challenging title. Instead its a slow-paced and confusing jumble.
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Game Informer,50,The play is way too shallow and unforgiving. [May 2002 p.89]
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,IGN,43,A comatose career mode weak multiplayer and lack of flair dont bespeak great longevity. But there are some boxers for masochists to unlock.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,360 Gamer Magazine UK,50,Theres a good game in there somewhere but its hidden behind the arm waving loopiness that takes up the majority of the game.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,GameDaily,50,Its gameplay consists of bland beat-em-up action and imprecise gun control. The in-game visuals vary between good (up close) and bad (zoomed out) and the co-op options are limited and confusing.
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,Nintendo Life,50,The randomised environments at the heart of Vaccine are a clever idea but like in the Wii U original serve up a flawed overall experience.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,IGN,50,Playing Cortex Command breaks my heart. With online multiplayer improved AI more scenarios and a more fleshed out campaign it could be something truly great but for now its just a number of cool ideas and great looks grafted onto noticeably repetitious level design and sub-optimal local multiplayer.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,48,Playing online with human opponents adds a bit of longevity to the experience but ultimately NPPL just gets monotonous far too quickly.
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,55,If youre expecting this to be more than the average licensed game though youll be a bit let down. [June 2008 p.88]
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Cheat Code Central,60,Only two kinds of gamers would appreciate this title: beginners and those looking for an easy hack-and-slash party game.
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,3DJuegos,54,Ridge Racer disappoints on Vita although car handling are top notch.
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,51,Once in a while you get a break from the shooter action in the form of a sea battle. With a single press on the L2 button you can command the human fleet towards the alien invaders. Unfortunately the strategy is about as shallow as the obligatory weather chat at the bakers. [June 2012 p.97]
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameWatcher,58,All in all this is a game that I still feel has potential. All the right aspects are there but the spit and polish is missing the spit.
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,Gamers' Temple,55,The games technical issues and inventory system bring it down heavily. Without the flaws its a decent survival horror game but nothing that stands out that well. If youre a hardcore survival horror player Submersed might be a game to consider (a guilty pleasure) but for those that want a quality survival horror look elsewhere.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Portugal,50,Mindjack fails miserably in almost all fields from gameplay and graphics to story.
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,ZTGD,55,If you’re looking for another runner game with a sci-fi setting Infinity runner isn’t bad it’s just not really that good either.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,ZTGD,55,The concept is a sound one but the technology simply falls short. I would love to see this idea fully realized and perfected but I fear that hefty price tag and poor reception may hinder future iterations in this direction.
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Game Over Online,52,Simply put it lacks innovation. The developers seemed satisfied creating a generic shooter with the most rudimentary gameplay.
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Computer Gaming World,60,An odd duck of an RPG Empire of Magic both entertains and annoys. [Aug 2003 p.82]
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,PSM Magazine,60,This is a much improved effort by Konami but its not going to out-Tony Hawk Neversoft. No way. [Dec 2002 p.42]
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,Computer Games Magazine,50,While no one is going to sling a gold medal around its box its much better than its predecessor in almost every way which boosts the quality from abysmal to merely okay.
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,God is a Geek,50,Calvino Noir needed less time and effort spent on aesthetics and more spent on gameplay and delivery.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,My Gamer,56,If a little more time was spent in development ironing out these kinks then Tornado could have been a solid form of competition for Katamari Damacy.
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,PC Games,64,Only die-hard fans of the Gothic franchise will be able to overlook the games terrible technical shortcomings. Forsaken Gods hits rock bottom of what was once a great roleplaying series.
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Brash Games,60,A game with some interesting gameplay ideas and unique takes on the classic side-scrolling shooter but unfortunately it doesn’t feel as intuitive as other classic games of this kind.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Extreme Gamer,54,Despite its cool cast of characters and excellent concept Blazing Lizards had a good starting point that missed the mark.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Game Chronicles,57,What little gameplay there is on this cartridge is mindless and not very fun.
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Game Informer,60,What the deal with the blander-than-bland texturing? If I wanted to be lulled to sleep I would read a selection from Minnesotas penal code. [Feb 2003 p.104]
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN,50,Its definitely a challenge to get through but the clumsy controls the off-and-on collision detection and the poorly-drawn game perspective is enough to make the game more frustrating than fun.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Softpedia,55,Bombshell is a relatively decent twin-stick shooter. It most certainly isn’t an action role-playing game like its marketing claims. It’s also weighed down by its shoddy story delivery and by its tedious stages.
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,GameSpot,50,Enemy Front lands in that unfortunate middle area where its faults arent bad enough to leave a painfully lasting negative impression but its key moments are too generic to be memorable.
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,Absolute Games,56,Flat and boring. Terminator: Salvation fails to earn other more favorable adjectives. The only bright spot is the soundtrack incorporating Brad Fiedel’s signature theme.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,MS Xbox World,55,Turning Point: Fall of Liberty is a novel idea on paper but is ultimately let down by its shooter by numbers gameplay and under par presentation.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,AtomicGamer,50,It sounds good but frankly it just doesnt seem like developer Digital Extremes were able (or allowed) to put forth the time money or ingenuity to make anything but a Starfleet-themed cooperative shooter complete with extreme use of cover-based gunfights silly mini-games or bad AI - all of which are generally considered hallmarks of a mediocre action game.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,PSX Nation,69,Cheerful juvenile and more fun than what our rating might imply Danger Girl is undone primarily because its engine is riddled with technical flaws (collision detection slug-like speed and frame-rate poor aiming).
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,AceGamez,50,Word Puzzle is a nice title for those looking for a decent word search experience in videogame form and the added modifiers such as bomb timers and stringing words together for extra points is a nice idea to bring in a wider audience but the constricted playing space thats just completely unwarranted really hinders the gameplay when you get to the later stages of the game with larger board types.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,IGN Spain,60,A complete disaster saved by a competent online multiplayer. Devils Third is ugly with bad control and is boring... Itagaki must have been napping while developing this.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Noisy Pixel,55,Seeing that Project Eden is designed to be a story-driven game I could have overlooked these issues and took the game as it was meant to be. Instead what I feel it was meant to be was a game that could have been more fleshed out with more weapons abilities and an extra round polish. Because for such a small team to develop a complete vision of a sci-fi world it seems that all was needed was some more time.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,The Digital Fix,50,It’s hard to recommend Blood Knights when there are similar games that offer a slicker production and far greater variety.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,Game Chronicles,55,Digimon World Data Squad was decent as far as gameplay was concerned but the graphics weren’t the best. I’ve seen better cel-shaded games on the PS2 than this title.
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,Cheat Code Central,48,Games are hard to control repetitive and not very fun. Single-player mode is tedious. Play value is how much the game has to offer not just replayability.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,Games Master UK,58,A frivolous racer with a hefty price tag but brief brainless appeal. [Aug 2008 p.83]
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,MEGamers,50,While they may have had the intention to try the game from another approach they managed to make a very sub-mediocre game that would only serve to kill time or let children play.
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,Worth Playing,45,Though it is a much better effort than the prior game Power Rangers: Super Megaforce is a game that is fine with being mediocre.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Hardcore Gamer,55,Quantum Theory has a lot of problems which is a shame because there is certainly the workings of a great game here even if it is derivative.
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Worth Playing,54,For the most part John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland is not a bad game. It is unfortunately a boring game with little incentive to play for longer than it takes to afford the tractor and ride it around for a while (maybe five hours which is very little for a simulation).
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,GameSpot,47,New Rally-X wasnt a terribly exciting game when it was released in 1981 so its tough to get worked up about an arcade-perfect version of it 25 years later.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameStar,49,We didnt expect part 2 to be better than part 1 but it scores 49 instead of the 48 points of the predecessor. Only 33 more Harry Potter games to go to be as good as the first one from 2002.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Vooks,40,Theres no reason to buy FIFA 20 on the Switch unless you can find it cheaper than FIFA 19 or youre a mad football fan in need of the latest rosters.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameZone,52,The finished product really let me down due to tons of problems - bad AI sloppy controls and slow gameplay.
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,The Digital Fix,60,Spuds Unleashed was not a bad game in fact I grew to somewhat enjoy it. I just feel it took too long to get to grips with the controls and the aiming was sometimes too inaccurate to be enjoyable. If you persevere you can get over this issue I just feel most people will be put off well before then.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,Game Informer,55,For all of the shock and hullaballoo following its path toward release Hatred is nothing special or particularly egregious in the world of video game violence except for the fact that it relies on that violence alone. The game takes itself extremely seriously and has plenty of extremely violent content and murder but it ends up feeling more like camp.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,50,Meant for younger gamers Flushed Away lacks the lemon-fresh tinge that would separate it from all the other cartoon platformers clogging the system. [Christmas 2006 p.96]
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,SpazioGames,60,There are some really good things in New Gundam Breaker but others are terribly wrong. We would recommend playing one of the other far superior Gundam games.
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Da Gameboyz,53,The game’s inadequate control scheme and frustration level is what really brings the enjoyment down.
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Games Master UK,52,Long-term Ape fans will be disappointed. [Sept 2011 p.92]
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,41,Theres a certain amount of tension as the clock ticks but moving the stylus up and down to mow lawns is both fiddly and a bit dull - you really need to keep all three mowers running at once to succeed. Add in a ravenous dog that wants to bite chunks out of your kids and the result is a gruelling unforgiving... well chore.
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,eToychest,50,Everything Final Fight made great is conspicuously absent in Streetwise.
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,VGPub,55,I don’t care how much you loved the film do not buy this game. If your children absolutely loved the movie then give Zathura a rental at most for them to get their thrills.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Hobby Consolas,60,Blades is a free to play dungeon crawler set in the Elder Scrolls universe with some interesting ideas but repetitive even boring levels and poor combat mechanics.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Nintendo Gamer,50,Plays like a second-rate attempt to rip off a series thats not enjoyed a distinguished recent past itself. [March 2012 p.99]
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gaming Age,58,I personally would have preferred a classic Joe title since nostalgia seems to be in these days but for what’s it’s worth G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra video game is exactly what you would expect from a film to game translation nothing more nothing less.
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,PSM3 Magazine UK,47,It is worth a rent however just to savour the few good bits laugh at all the glitches... and to start crying when you remember what Sonic games used to be like in the 90s. Sob.
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,DarkStation,50,What we have in the end is a game that charms you with how it looks and feels but then does nothing to keep your attention. It shows you that it doesnt want to be generic; that it genuinely wants to be an entertaining and memorable experience. However its shallow repetitive and tedious- things that were probably meant to be obscured by its broken online mode. With its likable premise and art style this one really makes you wish it were better than it is. There seems to be a gore-free gem in every genre. Super Dungeon Bros is not one of them.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Has far too many rough edges and faults to come close to Firaxis brilliance. [Issue#95 p.82]
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,Nintendo Power,54,Pitching and hitting play control are intuitive but fielding control is sorely lacking. [Apr 2003 p.135]
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,GamePro,50,Save your money for SmackDown 2 or any of THQs other upcoming wrestling titles.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Meristation,50,This Clone Wars game is not the ideal game. It has the potential but it lacks the visual the gameplay and the appeal. Its boring repetitive and short a game just for hardcore Star Wars lovers.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,3DJuegos,60,Yaiba gets some of the important parts right when it comes to a Hack and Slash Game but at the same time it has its issues with length camera and story.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,49,In total the whole Basic Training experience lives up to the basic in the title and will take you an hour to complete.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,3DJuegos,54,Part II has new characters and new enchantments but overall the game falls short of all expectations.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Pocket Gamer UK,50,A side-scrolling adventure based on a great book with platforms fighting and puzzles to negotiate. Some levels are fun as is the touchscreen alethiometer but a few good puzzles aside its nowhere near as good as it should have been.
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Pocket Gamer UK,50,Myst is a brilliant adventure game but without the oomph to show off its gorgeous visuals and sound this DS version is most disappointing.
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,Multiplayer.it,60,Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 does nothing to hide its fanservice nature; besides that the product is still fun to play and able to exercise a certain fascination. But little or nothing has changed since the old episodes with a clearly reduced budget that has even led to cuts.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,PlayStation Universe,45,Far less fun than both it could and should have been Surgeon Simulator ER is undone by poor PSVR implementation and lack of additional content over the previous non-VR release.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,IGN,57,Only fun for a very brief moment really and once that moment passes youre left with a very bland very dated racer.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,IGN,56,But in its current form and with so many other better wrestling titles out there its mediocrity is the only thing thats exceptional about it.
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,GameSpew,50,Despite its problems if you’re a keen online gamer and haven’t grown tired of the zombie epidemic as of yet Dead Alliance may be worth a shot. Just try to forgive its less than stellar presentation. Oh and forget about the single player add-on; it’s really not worth your time or money.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,IGN,60,Though there are some good concepts and admirable intentions here the game just seems unfinished. Performance issues aside the horrible pathfinding sticky interface and bizarre line of sight problems all point to a game that was rushed out too early.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,50,As a shooter you’ve been here a hundred times before. As an Aliens game it suffers the pressure of the legacy on which it’s built and the story is diabolically woeful. Game over man. [April 2013 p72]
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,4Players.de,52,The curse of the license strikes again. The action reminds me of Gauntlet and actually the Guardians stay as shallow and monotonous as the retro classic. No challenge and no variety make it difficult to appreciate the colorful art design.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Vandal,55,This new Star Wars videogame doesnt make the most of the new generation power but also is a boring and dull action game with no variety in its contents.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,Planet Xbox 360,51,A disappointing experience. Leave this one in your childhood memories where you did not mind how shallow it was.
Farscape: The Game,PC,Aug-8-2002,Red Lemon Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Entertainment Weekly,58,Not quite the challenge hardcore gamers or fans of the show are looking for. [20 Sept 2002 p.159)
Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameSpot,50,On the Nintendo DS Justice League Heroes is a halfhearted beat-em-up game that does very little to make you feel as if youre controlling your favorite comic book characters.
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,God is a Geek,50,After a bright start Gardening Mama’s irritating faults will have you wanting to throw in the trowel.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,50,Has its charm but is mainly plain boring.
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Planet Xbox 360,64,Hot Wheels: Beat That is the kind of battle racing game that will score well with the younger crowd that the 360 too often forgets about. If you are still of the age where you enjoy the occasional spin around the room with a die-cast car this will be right up your alley. For the rest the shallow repetitive gameplay will wear on you after a few hours.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,IGN,55,It lacks the humor and charm of the original show and even the new one for that matter. It gives you plenty of characters but no real reason to prefer one to the other.
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Impulsegamer,55,In the end Naughty Teddy had the character premise and even the story however the gameplay needed some more polishing.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Eurogamer,50,Bliss Island is about as uninspired as mini-game compilations get with a flavourless selection of challenges and a half-hearted attempt at adding charm and character.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Happy Puppy,50,Cloggy rutty a little bit old and just a little too safe -- precisely the sensations one is trying to avoid with a game based on motocross.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Eurogamer Portugal,50,It’s not really good game or a really bad one it stays somewhere in the middle.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Meristation,55,Funk of Titans is a simple and direct platform game in firsts stages. But its also too repetitive with a weak level design and irregular graphics.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,PC Games,46,Just call the bulldozer already: This theme park ruin is ready for demolition and is neither safe nor enjoyable to play in. Better get Planet Coaster asap.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,GameWatcher,50,There are lots of good ideas here variations in objectives AI companions skill building and numerous aircrafts to fly but it all feels so bland mundane even.
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Nintendo Power,60,Despite appropriating elements from the popular Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and Burnout franchises Asphalt 3D is an unexceptional arcade-racing title. [April 2011 p.86]
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,Zentendo,60,While the difficulty does come close to being cheap at times it’s not to the point of making you want to stop playing the game forever. If you have an extra five bucks to burn give it a shot.
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Hardcore Gamer,50,After such a long absence this is a disappointing effort to say the least. EA has promised that they will remedy many of the predominately visual issues that plague it but until that or a drastic price drop occurs there’s simply no reason to own NBA Live 14 with NBA 2K14 in existence.
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),50,After eight years. the basic gut-level hack-and-slash action hasnt changed much and that makes it hard to keep caring about Dynasty Warriors. [Jan 2009 p.83]
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Power,58,The characters are big and bold and the pace is quick but the characters actions are limited to running jumping and punching even though they should be capable of much more. [Jan 2004 p.161]
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,An average party game regurgitation. Not at this price. [Oct 2012 p.101]
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Game Chronicles,54,Naughty Bear would have been a great $15 Summer of Arcade game but as a standalone retail title I cant recommend a purchase until this hits the $20 bargain bin and even then your standards or at least your expectations had better be low.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameCritics,50,I certainly appreciate what Deadfall Adventures was going for and Im always open to adventuring on a less-than-AAA scale but the over-reliance on shooting and the abysmal voice acting knock this afternoon-matinee romp down a few pegs.
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,1UP,50,The classic games are completely underutilized due to the time limits placed on them causing each to offer no more than a few minutes of gameplay. Theres fun to be had -- just dont expect it to last very long.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PSFocus,48,A PSN game based on the new movie. This game is a first person shooter and the only thing you have to do is kill every alien that comes on your path. The graphical style is unique and nice but the rest of the game isnt great. Its repetitive and boring and the audio is bad.
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,60,It asks philosophical questions but it should have put that heavy thinking into the gameplay.
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,Impulsegamer,56,Ugly unplayable and filled with glitches not even the biggest wrestling fan should pick up WWE 2K20 in its current state.
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,MondoXbox,50,Interesting ideas like the multiplayer interactions arent supported by a suitable structure story and technical execution.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Multiplayer.it,50,Starting from some good ideas Enki fails to deliver the advertised repeatable experience. Theres also some creepy atmosphere around but it goes away too soon.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Hot Games,50,The Legend of Alon Dar goes for the big story (which is lame in its own way) and the big RPG feeling - but falls short on both counts.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameSpot,53,Music is a generic sampling of the pop-punk found in many games today but you wont hear much of it because its obscured by the incessant annoying buzz of motorbike engines.
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Game Informer,55,Think Syfy original movie. [Mar 2011 p.98]
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,Hardcore Gamer,50,One Piece: Romance Dawn is a great idea that was poorly executed. While fans and newcomers will appreciate the story the gameplay feels like an afterthought. It becomes bland after mere hours and starts to feel like you’re going through the motions. This is not the reaction you want in an RPG especially a long one like Romance Dawn.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,PC Gameworld,65,The great sim that could have been Game Tycoon is instead a dull entry in a genre that is already overflowing with dull entries.
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,GameTrailers,56,Iron Man has its occasional bright spots but the gameplay fluctuates between monotony and frustration. With technical meltdowns unsightly visuals and a jumbled plot line there are more than enough reasons to leave this junker on the scrap heap.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,50,It fatally crosses the streams after only a short amount of time. [June 2011 p.112]
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,3DJuegos,59,We don’t know if the concepts of Stormrise will be followed for the future of the RTS genre in consoles but now it is a game pumped with great ideas though these are not well executed. Strategy hardcores can find in it interesting entertainment but as precursory of a new IP this first effort is pretty disappointing especially in this PC edition.
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GamingTrend,48,It’s too bad that this game wasn’t better developed and given more time to polish. Instead of a fine dish of Klingon gagh we end up with poorly sung Klingon opera.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Everyeye.it,60,If you are a fan of Touhou and just cannot do without evaluating your purchase we suggest you switch to the Switch version after a drop in price.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,AceGamez,50,The frustrating and sluggish gameplay is only marred further by some completely uninspiring visuals.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gamer's Pulse,50,Graphical scalability and an intuitive interface are heavily outweighed by poor graphics and sound uninspired gameplay and a lack of scientific information about the dinosaurs you are exploiting.
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,Just Adventure,75,Although I found the game enjoyable and challenging (youll have a jigsaw puzzle to solve -arghhhhhhh) the game does not present much in the innovation department and the storyline is a little weak. But hey this is the real deal - a good solid adventure yarn and I recommend it.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,GamingTrend,47,For the sake of the people in our profession please quality check titles before publishing them. If at any point in the testing you sense an urgency to find something sharp and jab yourself with it repeatedly then make a mental note that it’s the fault of a poor game.
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Kombo,55,It is not as good as The Warriors but if you can look past the SERIOUS glitches its a fun but short game.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,58,The co-op functionality and the vast array of collectibles are nice additions on the surface but being unable to play with friends online and not unlocking anything substantial keeps the experience lackluster.
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,Destructoid,50,Fear Effect Sedna shows that the developer truly knows its source material inside out but unfortunately the gameplay aspect remains lost. With poor voice-acting a broken almost unnecessary tactical system unreliable A.I. and flat action Sedna just isnt fun or compelling.
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,NintendoWorldReport,40,Block Factory is a neat idea that is too ambitious for its own good.
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,Everyeye.it,50,Time and Eternity despite the promises its bland and uninspired. The game lacks everything that an RPG needs.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,GameZone,75,We dont want to work. Its not fun. MC Groovz Dance Craze makes it fun just as DDR has. The difference here is that you dont have to work as hard with this game. You can move at your own pace and work your way up to DDRs level.
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,SpazioGames,55,Bloodforge is a game with great potential unfortunately a very bad technical realization states the failure of the product.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Jolt Online Gaming UK,60,Archlord is a case of seen it before seen it better and the stuff we haven’t seen is going to end up more frustrating and hassle than it is worth.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Destructoid,55,Its a shame because sometimes even when Im fighting the game Im enjoying myself.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,PlayStation Country,50,Nickelodeon Kart Racers is a disappointing misstep. It handles fine with some mildly interesting track designs. Sadly it struggles to really really lean into the cartoons individuality. This is a simple ride that wont offer much in the way of challenge and overall it lacks some care and attention that couldve provided something more compelling.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,Cheat Code Central,50,Other than the three or four hours of play youll get out of Coraline there isnt much left to be done.
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,DailyGame,50,Is this game as bad as it seems? Not really but if killing terrorists is your pleasure you’re better off doing it in 3D with one of the Rainbow Six games and focusing your time on Al-Qaeda-like enemies not the local goombas.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,XboxAddict,60,After the first hour or so of playing I wished I were playing a classic rather than putting up with a new game dressed up like a classic.
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,3DJuegos,49,Brave: A Warriors Tale for the Xbox 360 is a game only recommended for children who are just picking up gaming.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,GamingXP,50,If youre searching for some kind of musical workout this one might be made just for you. Otherwise there are better dance games out there as well as better fitness games.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,IGN,50,Shooting Nazis in the streets of three major U.S. cities should be a non-stop thrill ride that has me on the edge of my seat. This game provides the opposite experience.
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameZone,61,This is one of the few compilation games that actually passes the bar barely. I cant say that this is the one for you but there is some fun found in this title you just have to look.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamingExcellence,51,A game with the same mechanics but vastly improved controls combat and level design could be really enjoyable. SPRay while attempting to do this falls flat on its face in the process.
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,Eurogamer Italy,50,Kursk is an interesting idea on paper but the actual product falls short in many aspects. The gameplay is dull uninteresting and full of dead moments the production values are average at best.
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Generación Xbox,60,Puzzles and stealth are the main attractions of this peculiar videogame by the Prussian Dynamic Pixels. A title full of good intentions but riddled with bad results.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Pocket Gamer UK,50,Steel Horizon offers some strategic subtleties but the slowness of gameplay means it takes a very dedicated commander to unlock its twists and turns.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC PowerPlay,50,Bearing in mind that you’ll need to do some serious thinking Stranger is otherwise a pretty thoughtful game and one that is worth a good many hours play. [Mar 2008 p.62]
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Gamer 2.0,50,On the whole Rock Revolution just falls short on every level.
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Critical Hit,49,If you can look past the terrible controls barely optimised visuals useless trick system and erratic frame-rate issues then MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore might appeal to you.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,Destructoid,50,For someone who actually enjoyed playing CSI: Deadly Intent the minor gameplay improvements here only led to an inadvertent feeling of repetitiveness minus the joy of those amusing cases from the last game.
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Boomtown,60,Sky Diving remains a cheap and cheerful title that will get your Sixaxis muscles flowing again.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,XGN,55,Prison Break: The Conspiracy shows you in the right way the whole prison and the story of Michael. Unfortunately the graphics scores far below and the gameplay is a little disappointing. These are the factors the final grade of this game is nearly enough.
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,Official Xbox Magazine,50,The ride is short and bittersweet. [June 2002 p.77]
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Daily Radar,50,Its fair to say that the interface stands out as one of the best weve seen in years. Shame we cant say the same about the game.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Nintendo Power,55,Success gives you a feeling of accomplishment but the path is paved with frustration. [Apr 2007 p.87]
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,GameCritics,50,With an interesting main storyline creative enemies and fundamentally solid gameplay its too bad that that Arcania: The Complete Tales technical flaws prevent it from being a must-play. There arent enough decent action-RPG hybrids for console players as it is and Arcania isnt going to do much to fix that.
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,PSM Magazine,55,Fans of the program may be able to stomach the shallow repetitive combat and confusing enemy targeting but everyone else can avoid it with a clear conscience. [Jan 2007 p.88]
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,MondoXbox,55,Tennis World Tour feels too incomplete and detached from a real tennis experience to be at least satisfying. A good Career structure and nice graphics arent enough to counterbalance the bad gameplay and a lack of essential modes like online support and Doubles.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Game Chronicles,54,I was a little disappointed with the length of the game. It was about an hour too short.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Computer Games Online RO,50,A dull 3D Action game in the strictest sense and besides the wall climbing or web swinging that your character can do it doesnt bring anything new to the genre
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Worth Playing,55,Sadly this game is no Ikaruga or even a Crimson Skies; the truth of the matter is that I could be playing my old copy of AstroBlast on my old Atari 2600 (well if it still worked) and get the same amount of rush shooting random rocks as I could at shooting down ships and their shields in this game.
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,IGN,55,If you want to be Iron Man go get Marvel Ultimate Alliance or something because this isn’t cutting it.
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,IGN,45,The challenge with Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge is spending a large amount of time attempting to master the events in this budget title when there are other all encompassing sports games that have better controls more depth and better visuals and commentary than this one.
Deca Sports 3,Wii,Oct-26-2010,Hudson | NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Sports | General | General,Nintendo Power,45,The execution feels both overly simplistic and loose. [Dec 2010 p.87]
Rugby 18,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Koch Media,Sports | Team | Rugby,Playstation Official Magazine UK,50,Congratulating Rugby 18 for its base functionality is like cheering for FIFA because they remembered to include the ball. [Christmas 2017 p.83]
Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Four Fat Chicks,60,Legacy: Dark Shadows isnt a bad game and there definitely appeared to be a better game lurking somewhere just on the outer boundaries.
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,GameZone,65,In spite of decent fight graphics and a solid audio track this PC release manages only minimal intrigue and game play that stagnates in the dark corridors that play out as the game’s map board.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Console Monster,50,If you enjoyed the movie the game may potentially be worth a wait but as with most movie game tie-ins the game just isn’t up to scratch and will no doubt be found in the bargain-bin in a shop near you soon.
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,Eurogamer,50,Neither a triumph of design nor storytelling and stymied by poor execution Wayward Manor is a rough proposition. But theres something worthwhile here even if its the unusual power fantasy of being able to haunt an aristocratic family from the safety of the rafters.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,You can almost hear gamers exhale as they play. [Issue#42 p.112]
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,IGN,50,Cyberball 2072 holds up fairly well and the option to team up with a friend and take on some live humans would have made this a great arcade football alternative. As it stands the game just isnt all there.
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Destructoid,70,Surprisingly good. Its definitely not as great in the gameplay department as War for Cybertron with a lot less to do and a far more restricted format but its superior narrative and decent arcade action is at least enough to make it worth picking up on its own.
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Game Informer,58,You know the drill: extremely linear level designs that stitch together corridors open areas and dull objectives with all the refinement and subltlety of a drunken quilting circle. [Mar 2006 p.100]
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,Multiplayer.it,50,Arcania: Fall of Setarrif is unable to bring anything new in the Arcania universe. Same combat same objects smaller locations and lesser graphics make this experience a flat promenade toward an (again) unsatisfying final.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),60,Which is too bad because beneath the sluggishness Mana Khemia: Student Alliance offers an absorbing school experience with quirky characters and a fun story. [June 2009 p.83]
Damnation,PC,May-22-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Zone UK,50,Damnation is so deeply generic and boring so it gets the sort of mark that it deserves. [Aug 2009 p.71]
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,DS,Jun-17-2008,Farmind Ltd,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Cheat Code Central,48,Wacky Racers is still a better cartoon than a game. Crash and Dash is proof of that.
One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,We Got This Covered,60,One Way Trip may not be a great game but I definitely feel like everyone should meet Boobs Cowboy and use the term word more often.
Alien Blast: The Encounter,PC,Feb-9-2004,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GameZone,55,You’re stuck in your gun turret firing off your weapons to an endless amount of aliens and that’s it! There isn’t anything else to do in the game but blow up aliens in your turret.
Robot Arena,PC,Apr-1-2001,Gabriel Interactive,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Breeding/Constructing,Happy Puppy,40,To clarify its your typical boy-meets-scrap-parts-that-will-eventually-become-a-killing-machine tale minus any compelling death scenes or token nudity shots.
Rally Challenge 2000,Nintendo 64,Jun-30-2000,Europress,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Hot Games,50,Its not going to keep you up nights either; its simply an amalgam of traits copied from more successful franchises with a few new innovations that dont really add much to the gameplay.
Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Eurogamer,50,If youre the parent of a five year-old boy you can sit them in front of Emergency Heroes and leave the room confident its less graphically violent than an episode of The Archers. Just be aware that for anyone over five its also less thrilling.
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,PC Gamer,43,Even $12 is too much to ask for what feels like a half-hearted community mod. [Apr 2012 p.79]
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GameSpot,51,It doesnt take long to get over the novelty of the included steering wheel and beyond that this is a very unremarkable racing game that isnt much fun.
Timeline,PC,Nov-12-2000,Timeline Computer Entertainment,Action | General | General,Happy Puppy,50,In an attempt to please everyone the games standard may be that of the lowest common denominator. At least the book is included in the package.
MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,MondoXbox,54,A good activities and environments variety is ruined by too-monotonous gameplay where except for climbing were asked to repeat very similar moves for each sport.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Wii,Nov-16-2010,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,50,This game feels like a preliminary build rather than a finished game and its unenjoyable as a result.
The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,45,The Golden Compass is just another family-friendly film cash-in with few redeeming qualities.
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Video Chums,40,Gungrave VR will make you feel cool as you shoot your foes while dodging and occasionally reflecting their projectiles but its so sloppily put together that its hard to enjoy the action for longer than a few minutes at a time.
Waking,PC,Jun-18-2020,Jason Oda,Action | General,The Indie Game Website,60,In theory Waking sounds like a fascinating project with the game showing hints of delivering a highly tailored personal and transformative experience. But what begins as an exercise for intimate self-reflection wound up becoming an increasingly detached experience for the player. By putting them into the game in the most literal sense Waking fell short when it was unable to capture all the nuances of its impossible protagonist: yourself. While I admire the boldness of its vision I simply couldn’t connect with the extent of its execution.
JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,Trickstar Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Stuttery. [March 2012 p.95]
Taito Legends Power-Up,PSP,May-17-2007,Empire Oxford,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Games Master UK,44,A tepid bundle of mini-games that fails to raise a laugh or even the pulse. [Dec 2006 p.100]
Rapala Tournament Fishing!,Wii,Nov-22-2006,MagicWand,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Cheat Code Central,50,It speaks volumes that when I was taking a break from reviewing RTF I went back to my Zelda game and found myself visiting the fishing hole and enjoying it far more even though its not as complex as Rapala.
DARK,PC,Jul-3-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Hooked Gamers,50,There are certain moments where everything clicks where the stars align and you’ll feel like the dark puppetmaster you should feel like the whole game and most of these moments are because of the powers.
Seduce Me,PC,Jan-2-2013,None,Strategy | General | General,IGN Italia,50,Seduce Me gives you what youre looking for but not much more. It has some nice ideas but theyre not well developed and even the adult content while decently made and with some nice art could have been better. A mediocre game.
Lets Fish! Hooked On,PlayStation Vita,Jan-29-2013,SIMS,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Gamestyle,50,Let’s Fish! Hooked On is simply an average game one that you will go back to once in a while but not one that you will seek out to play. It is a game that does the basics well enough but could have done with more time engaging the player. It is by no means a game you should avoid but neither is it one that you should rush and download.
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,PC,Oct-17-2006,Apeiron,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | General | Modern,Game Chronicles,50,Brigade E5 has the biggest choice of weapons and equipment I have seen in any video game and it is all usable. That in itself says a lot toward the game and its potential even though it does have some larger problems.
Turtle Tale,3DS,May-22-2014,Saturnine Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,50,There is nothing to say about a game that promises very little and aims very low. This is a low-cost low-ambition low-achievement title - there are no significant problems but its margin is so narrow that theres no space to do anything else other having a short-lived entertaining run that wont take long to finish.
Street Supremacy,PSP,Feb-28-2006,Genki,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,50,The game suffers from long loads poor control and an unplayable multi-player mode.
Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,DarkStation,50,Nostalgia is the sole reason I can fathom someone would want Dragons Lair at this point and admittedly the Xbox Live Arcade version is as solid as a HD release as either the iOS or PSN release. Regardless Dragons Lair is a quest best remembered in kind aged memories rather than on your Xbox 360.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Total Video Games,60,It’s a very simple concept if you’re a Pop Idol fan then you’ve probably already put in your pre-order for this game if you’re not then it’s better left staying away from this game it’s simply too shallow and doesn’t last long enough to warrant more then a rent.
101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix,Wii,Jan-13-2011,Nordcurrent,Sports | General | General,Cubed3,60,101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix may not set the world on fire or usurp the likes of WarioWare: Smooth Moves from its lofty perch but Nordcurrents effort definitely achieves some merit for including such a vast amount of mini-games many of which do indeed prove to be extremely entertaining either alone or with three other friends in tow.
007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,52,The biggest problem is the god awful graphics. Even the Bond logo on the background of the menu looks like it was imported directly from a PlayStation 1 game. And thats just the menu screen the actual game doesnt look much better. [December 2012 p.88]
Mall Tycoon,PC,Feb-3-2002,Holistic Design | Inc.,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GameSpot,46,The games excellent music just cant compensate for its poor graphics or clunky interface.
Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project,Xbox 360,Jun-23-2010,3D Realms,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Horizontal,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,A sub-par game that hasnt aged well. [Sept 2010 p.103]
Clash of the Titans,PlayStation 3,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Extreme Gamer,56,Depending on your expectations Clash is likely going to disappoint and even with all its heart and extra features the core mechanics are slightly dated which brings the action down a notch.
0 Day Attack on Earth,Xbox 360,Dec-23-2009,Gulti,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,50,Online play undercut by crummy design choices. [Mar 2010 p.83]
Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Impulsegamer,50,Iron Man 2 limps onto the scene for several game platforms and is a rusted heap on arrival. The bit of fun to be had does not out weigh the not so fun aspects of the game.
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,Vandal,40,Dollhouse has some interesting ideas but currently there are to many bugs including some game-breaking bugs. When it works its repetitive nature shows up and even if the developers fix the bugs we don’t think we would have a particularly good game. At least for now if you’re interested in the game wait for a few patches.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,RealGamer,56,Due to its overall poor design the game seems to of become nothing more then a mass of space shooting sequences.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Nintendo Enthusiast,45,You would need to be a really hardcore SpongeBob SquarePants Rugrats Hey Arnold! or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan to prefer this. I don’t doubt that there is a really good game that could be made with the Nickelodeon license but it needs to have much better core mechanics. And with such a great library of Nickelodeon properties available you can’t help but feel it should be using more of them.
Way of the Dogg,Xbox 360,May-3-2013,Echo Peak,General | Action | General,Multiplayer.it,50,A missed opportunity an original title that suffers from numerous flaws that make the gaming experience flawed.
4PM,PC,Jul-9-2014,Bojan Brbora,Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,SpazioGames,40,4 PM is not what we want from the new school of storytelling. Exploiting themes such as alcoholism and suicide to make an otherwise unattractive project appealing is sinister and disrespectful.
WWII Aces,Wii,Mar-21-2008,Arcade Moon,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,IGN,45,Its still a pretty crappy game but theres certainly a little more merit in this game compared to some of the other lower-budget third party Wii titles on the market.
Delta Force: Xtreme 2,PC,May-27-2009,NovaLogic,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameSpot,50,This xtremely forgettable first-person shooter doesnt excel at anything.
Slain!,PC,Mar-24-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Games.cz,50,Visually nice heavy metal platformer forgot to sell its soul to the devil to get some fun in its gameplay. The creators focused too much on the music and visuals but forgot about the game.
Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Pelit (Finland),47,You come at the king you best not miss. Comparing Alekhine’s Gun to an AAA title like Hitman may seem unfair but Maximum Games made the mistake of trying to defeat the ruler of the genre with its own weapons and they take a beating on every front. [May 2016]
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Deeko,70,The control scheme is impressive the multi-player mode is entertaining and the mission structure is solid but the visuals and audio presentation really could have used a bit of work; plus the game is simply too short.
The Polar Express,GameCube,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PGNx Media,55,A definite case of a game rushed to meet the movie’s release. Blue Tongue incorporated several styles of play but these are blemished by the imperceptive control scheme.
Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,Nintendo Power,48,Responsive control helps make the game an enjoyable play. [Oct 2004 p.124]
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Computer Games Magazine,40,On the whole Evil Dead isnt horrifically bad—just surprisingly limp-wristed.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,IGN,45,If Naval Assault had been a downloadable Xbox Live Arcade title it would have been easy to forgive a lot of its shortcomings. Unfortunately its not; it looks like a last-gen game with some of the worst sound design and music Ive seen in a retail release no mid-mission checkpoints and most importantly not much to hold ones interest for more than a few fleeting moments.
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,GamingTrend,48,It’s a bummer but that’s what happens to most video games as they age: they’re never as good as we once remembered.
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GameShark,40,The enemies are varied enough and can be deadly but they are animated poorly and just look bad.
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,GameZone,50,While not a bad childrens game in the sense of being too hard or frustrating neither is it a good game and it wont keep anyones attention for long.
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Daily Radar,50,Serious motorcycle enthusiasts might want to give this one a whirl -- to crash really expensive bikes on bland racecourses if for nothing else -- but the vast majority of Dreamcast owners will want to avoid this game.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,50,Its a shame Ace Banana can be so flustering because there is a decent shooting gallery to unpeel here. [Christmas 2016 p.86]
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,IGN,54,Almost all of the much-touted style evaporates as soon as the introductory movie is over and were met with stiff animation blurry textures popping geometry a dated engine underwhelming vehicle sound a stale world kryptonite light poles bouncing parked cars forgettable on-foot action and only passable vehicular dynamics.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,Xboxic,50,The free-falling dynamic feels fresh and acts as the element that sets the title apart from the rest of the pack but due to the poor execution of the intriguing gameplay formula and downsides like too little bang for the buck Screwjumper! falls flat on its face.
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,PC Format,51,There are a million and one better shooters out there. [Dec 2006 p.118]
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Cubed3,50,Chronus Arc may not be anywhere near as desirable as some of the other latest RPG releases but for the price it still manages to deliver a somewhat enjoyable traditional and recognisable Japanese role-playing experience.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Nintendojo,42,It’s just too bad that this dungeon crawler just doesn’t live up to what it looks like.
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,IGN,50,Emergency Mayhem is a me-too Crazy Taxi clone with some added Wii waggle minis. If you can live with that -- and the games lackluster graphical presentation -- you will find a fast-paced arcde-style driving game here.
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Nintendo Life,50,Some people may enjoy the interesting control setup and the innovative power-ups but poor level design average graphics little enemy variation the slow pace awful music and bad sound effects ultimately sour what could have been an enjoyable blast.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,IGN,50,There are bugs and instability and interesting environments cant overcome bland gameplay weak AI and lack of polish.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PC Games,51,A terrible shooter with pretty much nothing to like about: the level design is horrible and the AI turns out to be foolish at best. Explicit gore does not make up for bad game design in fact it makes this games mistakes stand out even more. If it werent for the acceptable cutscenes and some halfway spooky level sections this game would be an even bigger disaster than it already is.
Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,GameZone,49,Underground Pool could have been a fun portable billiards experience for your Nintendo DS but limited touch screen action unintelligent opponent AI and poor controls make this one a game you should skip.
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Gamezilla!,69,If youre a fan of McCaffreys writing then take a look at this one -- youll probably enjoy it. But if youre a real adventure aficionado youll undoubtedly find the game too easy for your tastes better to give this one a miss than be disappointed.
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GamerNode,50,Eureka 7 Vol. 2: The New Vision suffers from a plethora of problems ranging from bad combat to a corny story to a bunch of un-fixed bugs. As an interactive anime however youre getting ~5 hours or so of new video about the Eureka 7 universe.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,XGN,50,The show Adventure Time is funny quirky and even heartwarming at some times. It’s a shame the game is the opposite of that and just plain old boring. There is too little variation in the game and with a hundred levels; it’ll be difficult to get through the game.
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,43,Xiaolin Showdown relies on its multiplayer to facilitate replay value. Unfortunately this game doesnt have any. The monotonous and all-too-easy button-mashing combat is so been there done that its not even remotely interesting.
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,45,The only thing Painkiller gets right (sort of) are the original weapons. Everything else is a complete mess. The game looks better than the original but that is about the only good thing you can say about the graphics. Blurry textures horrible screen tearing and slow loading details ruin the experience even further. [September p.88]
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,Hardcore Gamer,50,At the end of the day unless you’re an agriculture fanatic that is interested in the rush of cultivating and harvesting fields for hours on end you’re likely to feel cheated by a lack of content boring gameplay and unimpressive visuals. Ultimately the farm life is exactly what I expected — a lot of hard work for very little pay off.
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,The Escapist,50,There isnt much reason to play Escape Dead Island. The narrative has a few standout moments and youll occasionally meet an enemy that will throw you for a loop. Those moments are unfortunately needles in a haystack of monotonous gameplay thats ultimately boring.
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GRYOnline.pl,45,Inner Chains is scary but not due to its atmosphere. Underneath a beautiful haunting world hides a boring simple shooter. Everything looks good at first glance but the devil is in the details. And the details are frustrating and full of bugs. The entire game looks and feels like an unfinished tech-demo.
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Nexus,50,Unfortunately The Warriors: Street Brawl completely forgets what was fun about the movie and the 2004 game instead the property into a repetitive brawler with no depth or character!
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,IGN,45,Not liking Brain Boost has nothing to do with Majesco copying Nintendo and has everything to do with Majesco not copying what made Nintendos Brain games good.
MTV Sports: Skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald,PlayStation,Sep-12-2000,Darkblack,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Daily Radar,50,Its not a terrible game and if someone were trapped on a long flight with nothing but this game and a PSOne they could do a lot worse.
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,Digital Entertainment News,45,Fans of the show will adore it. Anyone else is more likely to scratch their head in puzzlement and move on to more complete fighters.
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Gamereactor Denmark,50,Zombie-filled races is a nice if not exactly original idea but the developers havent managed to turn it into an interesting game. The gameplay quickly becomes tedious the car physics feel too light the difficulty lacks challenge and frequent slowdowns mar the experience. If youre hurting for a Carmageddon sequel this might sate you for a while but its no replacement.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Gamereactor Denmark,50,Flawed in so many ways this feels like a rushed product and even though the voice acting is by most of the actors from the show it feels as uninspired as the rest of the game.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Maxim Online,40,Passing and shooting in these high-scoring battles is as easy as squeezing the trigger on an Uzi but complicated button-mashing for trick moves muddy graphics and a schizophrenic soundtrack of Method Man TLC and Foo Fighters all draw red cards.
Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu,Game Boy Advance,Nov-24-2003,Webfoot Technologies,Action | Fighting | 2D,Armchair Empire,59,A poorly constructed fighting game that doesnt have the same fun and addicting aura that Street Fighter and King of Fighters has.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamestyle,50,This would make an excellent PSN or XBLA game and would be worth paying top price for. But as a top price full release game this should be a lot better.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,45,The Golden Compass is just another family-friendly film cash-in with few redeeming qualities.
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,50,We know theres a lot of talent in this studio but this time they offer a mediocre experience where even though the main mechanic works its hard to highlight something.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Youd do better to get Kinect Sports instead. [Feb 2011 p.99]
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,60,Moderately challenging and entertaining Acme Arsenal is nevertheless far from memorable. [Nov 2007 p.99]
Real Steel,Xbox 360,Oct-12-2011,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,DarkStation,50,Grinding out levels and paid for content have their places in games and neither should be in a $10 downloadable game based on a movie. There are a few moments that the game feels really fun but those moments wear off very quickly once the grind kicks in. Unless Real Steel is a movie that defines you there really isnt any reason to go whole hog over this game. Oh it doesnt have Hugh Jackman in it in case you were wondering.
Soldier Elite,PC,May-29-2006,Metropolis Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,IC-Games,45,It could have been done so much better there are so many little flaws that add up to a missed opportunity for a decent game. The graphics and physics are very good but the faults with it cancel these out.
Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,Everyeye.it,60,After Depth Hunter Biart shows once again their ability to manage the underwater worlds. Deep Black Reloaded though is a FPS that has many problems but it could also be the starting point for more successful products.
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,55,The game lacks variety but it also doesnt outstay its welcome. If you want some laughs and dont mind that the shooting experience is average at best playing through this alien invasion is probably more entertaining than the movie and youll get some Achievements/Trophies out of it.
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,XGN,50,Montague’s Mount has a fantastic atmosphere but is too slow to get really creepy. With a mysterious tone you’ll want to discover it more and more. However it has too many flaws to be memorable.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,IGN,45,Bad control and poor execution ruin the experience.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,PC Gamer,42,Events unfold inexplicably unrealistically and almost arbitrarily. [June 2002 p.69]
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Its very much let down by repetitive play. [Issue#78 p.85]
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,TeamXbox,50,With a more refined graphical engine better play control and more options this game could have been very enjoyable. Sadly all of the previous elements were executed at a poor level and the game seems very rushed.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,3DAvenue,50,If any publisher wants success with Beijing 2008 they really have to start work on it now because as has been proven time and time again rushing Olympic games does not work.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,48,If you would like to play as the Fantastic Four but in a good game play Marvels Ultimate Alliance.
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,Hardcore Gamer,40,Titles like Senran Kagura or the Hyperdimension Neptunia series are incredibly dumb but are also entertaining. Despite their glaring flaws they warm this cold heart in my chest. Drive Girls drops the ball on every front that could redeem it. It squanders its concept with poor stage design ruining the sense of momentum. It takes what should be a simple hack and slash action game and complicates with the most poorly considered control scheme this side of playing Dark Souls with a Guitar Hero peripheral. Even the story which could have been a redeeming factor by way of just being amiable nonsense is tedious and dull. If Senran Kagura is the one that gets too drunk at a party and embarrasses itself to the amusement of onlookers Drive Girls is the one that pukes on the host’s pets and is confrontationally annoying. It’s unpleasant for everyone and people just want it to be gone.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,Game Chronicles,62,With a narrow vision of gameplay total lack of any story or compelling drama to carry you through 99 missions it is a pure arcade experience that most PC gamers have evolved out of a long time ago.
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,IGN,43,Somehow regardless of genre the franchise manages to wither whatever it touches.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PC,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,IGN,50,Shooting Nazis in the streets of three major U.S. cities should be a non-stop thrill ride that has me on the edge of my seat. This game provides the opposite experience.
25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,56,25 to Life is a lifelessly generic shooter that at times feels like Max Payne without the fun.
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,50,A very ordinary racing game with a wrong-headed storyline tacked on. Stick with Micro Machines for your diddy-driving kicks. [Oct 2006 p.105]
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),50,Clock takes a puzzle-driven adventure game and mixes it up with a side-scrolling platformer. Not a bad design template in theory but not so great as implemented here. [Aug 2012 p.86]
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,GameZone,50,This game just isn’t very enjoyable. Families should go with Mario Kart; while it’s more difficult it’s also much more fun.
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,PlayStation Country,60,Troll and I is a game whose ambition is deflated by a lack of polish and a worrying absence of player guidance. Combat feels serviceable if a little unsatisfying and they find good reasons to switch between the two titular protagonists. There’s an endearing story at play but the game itself has enough issues to stifle the most enthusiastic player. Repercussions from poor execution prevent this from being a truly worthwhile experience.
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,NintendoWorldReport,50,Reflexions is not great. There’s not much content there aren’t enough massage mini-games there aren’t enough dress-up options (at least not yet) and the voyeuristic tone is creepy. And then there’s the fantasy involving Asuka being your little sister which almost makes me want to nuke the game from orbit. For the Senran Kagura superfan it’s probably required reading but everyone else can just wait for Peach Beach Pinball.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,NZGamer,50,Roller Coaster Tycoon 3D is disappointing in every key respect and not recommended - unless you have a morbid curiosity and are interested to see how they managed to mess it up.
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,IGN,45,The Brain Boost games ride the success of Big Brain Academy and Brain Age but fail to actually understand why they were successful to begin with. And thats just not smart.
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSX Extreme,56,If youre older than 12 you have no business playing this game.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,EGM,55,A solid comedic core cannot save what becomes tedious gameplay as you move through the 10 different dimensions of the Multiverse. Throw in the mind-boggling lack of online multiplayer for a suite that clearly could have benefited from it and Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse should only appeal to fanatics of the FOX animated sitcom.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,IGN,45,It could have played like a slimmed down version of Pikmin crossed with quirky yet solid platformer elements. Unfortunately bad control and poor execution ruin the experience.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,My Gamer,52,This game simply cannot be recommended to anyone: the controls are busted the AI is pathetic and even with online play you will grow tired of it within an hour.
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Nintenderos,40,Hello Neighbor shows a pattern of ideas which comes from thrillers something that is common in the present but making it differently. The story in general can last as long as you want but there is a guideline through it. It is despite that a failure because the developers couldnt accomplish its goal in making a proper survival horror game.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Put your $10 toward a newspaper subscription instead. [Oct 2008 p.85]
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Cheat Code Central,54,In short Ju-On: The Grudge is a great idea marred by middling execution. Purchasers can expect some great scares but the actual gameplay feels clunky and unnatural and there isnt much play time to be had here. At $30 this is not a worthy buy.
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,GamingXP,48,Due to the bad graphics and the loveless setting with poor details Thor has dug his grave itself.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Do yourself a favor: leave R.I.P.D. in its grave.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,PC,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | Shooter | General | First-Person | Modern,GameWatcher,50,It’s not a game that you should spend your money on quite yet. Maybe after the passage of time when you can find it cheap or even for free it will be worth a cursory glance. For the moment however it’s best to skip this one out.
Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,Game Informer,50,Replicates the movies charm wonderfully but its lack of variety hardly qualifies it even as a party game. [Dec 2002 p.130]
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,Game Over Online,57,It was more like a nightmare than a dream for me. I didn’t enjoy any part of the game and I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.
Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,Xbox 360,Feb-10-2009,Tamsoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,Gameplayer,50,We have no doubt this went gangbusters in Japan but for those with slightly more discerning tastes blood and bikinis are simply not enough regardless of how impressive the jiggle physics are.
Tony Hawk's Motion,DS,Nov-18-2008,Creat Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,IGN,45,A lacking package that players would do well to ignore; especially since the DSi (and lack of GBA port for the new motion pack) is on its way in a matter of months.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,Wii,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,40,With frustrating gameplay a very short and linear experience and no multiplayer or unlockable modes/levels to speak of TotDE gives players no reason to keep playing.
Cartoon Network Racing,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Deeko,60,Despite all the A.I. cheating going on sluggish control and the been there done that track selection Cartoon Network Racing is actually fun. Just remember that little Timmy likes it and maybe...just maybe some of his innocence will rub off.
The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Life,40,Set in pretty landscapes with a storyline full of theoretical potential The Deer God had us highly intrigued during the first few moments of the game. Unfortunately though this instantly faded away and never returned; the repetitive nature of the core gameplay which mostly consists of just running to the right over the same platforms meant that we lost all interest in discovering the answers to its philosophical questions.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,IGN,40,Coffee Tycoon benefits from a subtle and entirely listenable jazz soundtrack but the interface sounds are a little too metallic and aggressive.
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,Electronic Gaming Monthly,45,Should be plenty fun for the very young ones in your family. [Mar 2002 p.141]
Resident Evil: Survivor,PlayStation,Aug-30-2000,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,Spank!,70,Resident Evil fanatics will probably hate it and call it a travesty but remove the Resident Evil tag and its a damn good zombie shooter with a revolutionary control system.
Realms of Ancient War,PC,Oct-4-2012,Wizarbox,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Absolute Games,40,R.A.W. is aeons away from both Diablo 3 and Torchlight 2. Even finding a new shiny trophy is not fun here.
Inkheart,DS,Jan-12-2009,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | General | General,Cheat Code Central,48,There will be little debate that Inkheart makes a better novel and a movie than it does a game. Dont let it break your heart.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Vandal,50,THPS5 is not the game we deserve. We dont know what happened there but its a messy game in many aspects. Still when its gameplay gets to shine we get some of the feelings we expected from it so we can only hope for some patches to help it get closer to what it should be.
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,Game Informer,40,Here’s a tip kids: You can play a better game at home with just a pen. Here’s how: start drawing circles on a sheet of paper. Yeah! You did it! Now your mom has something to put on the fridge.
Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,Vandal,45,And yet another game based on a movie that feels like it has been developed in a hurry and does too many things wrong and just a few right.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,PTGamers,45,This version has serious technical and design flaws that make it not much fun to play and are indication of a rushed conversion.
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,GameZone,50,Thanks to the poor controls and the fact that the levels seem to drag on forever Flight of the Falcon just feels like a very forced and flawed experienced from the very start.
Putty Squad,PlayStation 4,Mar-11-2014,System 3,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,4Players.de,45,What chaos! This is by far the weirdest jump-and-run I have played in a while. Unfortunately it is not as fascinating as it sounds since the novelty factor soon becomes stale and uninspired.
Motocross Mania 3,Xbox,Apr-27-2005,Deibus Studios,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameBiz,40,Driving a motorbike whacking your enemies seems almost like a thing of the past as it was perfected about ten years ago and hasnt been developed any further since.
Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,PGNx Media,55,The developers didn’t develop around the limitations of the Nintendo DS. Part of this is unavoidable since I’m not sure that the Nintendo DS can handle better crashes.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,Vandal,50,Sometimes beauty is just not enough.
Battleship,Xbox 360,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Tactical,Eurogamer,40,It doesnt really work as the game never finds the right way to balance the two modes of play but this brief flicker of ambition offers just enough ballast to prevent this otherwise tiresomely unremarkable game from sinking completely.
Battle: Los Angeles,PC,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Meristation,45,Being a cheap downloadable game is not an excuse for this. Extremely short campaign really low production values and lack of alternative modes or multiplayer make this an extremely poor deal. There are cheaper games that offer so much more than this.
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,Game Informer,40,Rail shooters dont get much more tedious lifeless or ugly than Attack of the Movies 3D. [Issue#206 p.96]
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,55,Although it is simple direct and fun it still doesnt live up for the absolute lack of polish of other aspects.
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Games Master UK,48,A muddled shooter where a lack of braaains and finesse derail any brief undead thrills. [Sept 2016 p.73]

Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,GameZone,49,Drive crash mini-game repeat. Pimp My Ride is a licensed game for die-hard fans.
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IGN,49,Godzilla fans deserve better than this. Unleashed isnt pretty isnt compelling and isnt nearly as fun as stepping into the skin of giant monsters should be. Everything about the game is phoned in. That said my four-year-old nephews have a blast with it.
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,GameCritics,45,With a lack of both polish and ambition Dark will never be anything but an also-ran. As a budget title its a passable entry-level stealth game but theres not enough here to justify recommending it when there are so many superior games in the genre. When a games best selling points are that the stealth is predictable and that the player is a vampire something has gone terribly wrong.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,NowGamer,40,Though there are flashes of interesting ideas none are fully realized and they are hidden behind a technically shoddy and boring shooter.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Everyeye.it,50,TMNT is a video game of poor production values​​ valid only for the die-hard fan of Pizza-loving turtles.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,GamingExcellence,43,Naruto has definitely seen better days. In the end all these problems cant be forgiven when put together not even by the most die-hard fans. Naruto: Dragon Blade Chronicles is perhaps a story that would have been better seen as an animated film. But as a video game you can pass on this story.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Game Almighty,47,Vampire Rain takes what could be an amazingly fun unique concept and basically throws it in the trash. Uninspired and forced stealth guns that don’t get fired undead that won’t die and more are all here.
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,45,With a great story and production values that mightve been enough But everything about the game is less-than-heroic including Thor himself. [Aug 2011 p.77]
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,IGN Spain,50,A game with some interesting ideas that falls down due to a poor execution which makes this game completely forgettable.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,NZGamer,60,The sound in Carnival Games Mini Golf is disjointed and weird.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,57,Unrefined and full of flaws but entertaining - in as may good ways as bad. [Nov 2009 p.86]
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,GameZone,55,The gameplay is extremely basic and somewhat boring. Build up an army go fight go to the next level. And so on.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Game Chronicles,55,All in all gamers can tie a lot of time up into Kengo: Legend of the 9 but so little of it is of any appreciable quality.
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Total Video Games,50,If you’re a fan of The Simpsons (who isn’t?) it’s likely that after the initial appeal wears off you’ll be left with a game that’s better served as a coffee-coaster.
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,Nintendo Life,40,As hard as it tries Blades of Time rarely comes close to emulating the success of any of its obvious muses. Its mixture of third-person melee combat environmental puzzles and platforming are entertaining for a while but they lack the nuance of Capcom’s long-running Devil May Cry series or Sony Santa Monica’s refreshed God of War. Only the ability to control time creating a co-operative element as you team up with your past self offers something truly rewarding to use in battle or as part of a puzzle solution. The MOBA-style overhaul of the games Onslaught mode offers an improved take on multiplayer but the wonky combat and lacklustre presentation are impossible to overlook.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,ZTGD,46,Rock Revolution is a bad attempt at cashing in on the genre. It really does nothing to separate itself and actually siphons most of the enjoyment out of playing music games.
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,ZTGD,60,With a colorful cast of characters and some inventive fight mechanics Legend of the Dragon isn’t a bad game; it just doesn’t do much to differentiate itself from the pack.
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Hobby Consolas,50,A poor shooting game (VR compatible) set in a war between North Korea and United States. Sadly it feels like an old arcade repetitive and short.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,TotalGames.net,51,Playing T3 was a joyless experience and only our loyalty to the Big Man kept us playing.
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,The lack of multiplayer is baffling. [July 2014 p.80]
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,God is a Geek,40,Despite its interesting puzzles DYING: Reborn struggles to be much more than a poor example of horror; the scares are few and far between the plot and its characters are horribly played out and given how generic it can frequently be it’s alarming how seriously it takes itself.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,45,It was a good opportunity to reinvigorate and polish the series and adapt to the final adventures of this characters. But the changes have been executed poorly and that results in gameplay defects.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Vandal,40,It’s a shame the final version of Hello Neighbor isn’t what we wanted it to be. The great concept is poorly executed with plenty of issues ranging from the physics to the AI or the puzzle design.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,52,If youre truly after a vapid brawling experience by all means be our guest. Overall however AA is a shallow trip down license lane and thats all folks.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Dreamcast HQ,60,One thing ECW:AR walks all over the competition with are options and matches. I have never seen so many type of matches in a game before.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameShark,58,It’s overtones about religion and beliefs are something that some may be wary of and those people more than likely wouldn’t want to touch the game with a ten foot pole. Those that can look past that though would have a pretty good time with the game despite its few flaws in gameplay.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,35,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor has all the right elements yet it still manages to do everything wrong.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Play Magazine,50,The game looks three years old but plays and sounds good enough to hang with barely. [Feb 2003 p.90]
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameZone,60,While it has a few frustrating problems Attack of the Clones is just about as good as a Star Wars game can get on the GBA.
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Game Informer,48,The combat is basic sloppy and imprecise and the spastic overhead camera often gets annoying. [Dec 2002 p.152]
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,GamingXP,54,Despite a solid story and decent graphics Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor fails to implement the Kinect in an acceptable manor. And so frustration prevails over the pleasure of gaming.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,Impulsegamer,46,All in all there may not be enough substance for a gamer to really stick around and play the game more than a few times in curiosity.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,My Gamer,42,The updated version is horribly unbalanced and way too difficult to be enjoyed.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,Gamestyle,50,With unique glitches evident Pure Football is an interpretation of the sport similar to Super Mario Strikers with its emphasis on pick up and play.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameSpot,50,While the third-person shooter aspect of Harrys latest adventure can be fun the games story elements fail to live up to those of its literary namesake.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameTrailers,48,The implementation of the Wii controls is solid but there’s no getting around the fact that this is an old game that’s been repurposed for Nintendo’s new controller to make a quick buck.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Nintendo Life,40,Fans of the Touhou Project might get some enjoyment purely from seeing their favourite characters on the big (or little) screen once more but this isn’t a quality fighting spin-off. The game’s slow pace disinteresting plot and lack of any serious fighting credentials leave an awful lot to be desired. If the game was considerably cheaper you could potentially justify a purchase for having quick easy-to-set-up fighting rounds; as it stands though this may well be best left alone.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Nexus,49,Randalls gameplay comes up short but offers a distinct style. However the controls and repetitve combat prevent this title from ever feeling gelled together. Although the art and music are the standout portion of this game its not enough to distract from a flawed experience.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GameSpot,43,Youd be better off staying away from this botched attempt to translate the great ninja stealth action series to the DS. Almost nothing good about Tenchu made the cut.
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,IGN,45,The real reason why you should just forget the game in general is that its simply not fun. There are moments where the mini-games approach mild entertainment but you can have just as much fun -- if not more -- playing a free Flash game. Gosh.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,IGN,44,An essential failure in almost every way. At best its a collection of rather boring events. At worst putting the Olympic symbol on the box is a mockery of the games excellent now bi-yearly presentation.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,Cheat Code Central,44,There isnt much to get excited about with Pocket Pool. Not even the models and their cheesy videos are likely to scintillate you.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,GamePro,50,While the outrageous roller coaster inspired tracks and arcade-themed charm where enough to bring a smile to my face Speed Zones charm is inevitably overpowered by a lackluster control scheme and a barrage of all-to-frequent deaths.
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpot,34,The environments are no fun to get through fights are infrequent and the simplistic combat is unfulfilling.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,The A.V. Club,50,Not half as bad apparently as the new Simpsons Game.
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSX Nation,50,I had some fun playing among the incredible amounts of both confusion and boredom.
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,AceGamez,50,If the developers had made more use of the Wiis unique controllers and cranked up the graphics I could have given this a better score. But like ordering a Mixed Vegetable Soup at my local Chinese takeaway Im going to have to give Legend of the Dragon a number five.
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Vandal,48,There were some promising things in Quantum Theory: its story its narrative and even the relationship between characters. But the game has constant ups and downs and the global result is not worthy.
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Spank!,60,Its just Duke being Duke - stupid but fun. For a while.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Next Level Gaming,48,Its just a shame that its got quite possibly the worst gameplay Ive seen in a fighting game I think ever. When I cant play a game for more than 5-6 minutes at a time that is NOT a good thing.
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,TheSixthAxis,40,Agony is true to its name and intentions a hellish experience. My excitement for the game was quickly quashed behind bugs crashes and unbalanced gameplay failing to live up to the potential of the game’s core ideas and outstanding visual design. I hope that I can travel back to Hell following some substantial patching but as things stand Agony is torture in all the wrong ways.
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Pocket Gamer UK,50,A distinct average and oddly passionless collection of touchscreen mini-games.
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,52,Gauntlet with no multiplayer is like trying to drive a car with no tires. What the heck is up with that?
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,TeamXbox,48,Technically unsound with many glitches; some of them major. Playable characters with individualized skill sets is a cool concept. Multiplayer is well WWII multiplayer.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Blackwater is a better use of Kinect controls than most but ultimately there are too many rough edges and not enough of a game here. [Issue#79 p.88]
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,Game Informer,50,Playing the trivia games was about as fun as Bliz got. [Dec 2001 p.118]
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,IGN Spain,50,Unfortunately Left Alive ends up being the heir of a period of Japanese development that we thought was extinct. Neither its stealth nor its shootings convince.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,GameZone,55,There are too many button needs to limit yourself to such a tiny panel of controls. You really need to stand back and SEE whats going on. You must have very quick fingers to survive for long.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Eurogamer,50,As a whole the game feels undercooked unpolished and ultimately unsatisfying.
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,Multiplayer.it,50,Underworld Ascendant is clearly an unfinished game full of technical bugs and poor in content. This isnt’ the way backers and many fans of the series should have been treated.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Cheat Code Central,44,Almost every aspect of the game from premise to execution is highly derivative and substantially lacking. The for-the-whole-family appeal is certainly present but your money is better spent taking the gang out to experience the real thing.
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,ZTGD,47,The biggest disappointment of Ready 2 Rumble Revolution is its wasted potential. There is a quality arcade boxing game buried under that motion-controlled mess and you really never get a chance to experience it.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Official Xbox Magazine,55,Mediocre. [Nov 2002 p.125]
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Twinfinite,40,Crystal Rift features some interesting puzzles and may be simple and easy to grasp but the poor visuals easily manipulated enemies limited field of view in standard play and difficult virtual reality movement means it pales in comparison to the dungeon crawlers of old.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,Worth Playing,55,Traitors Gate II has a few good ideas and some graphics in areas that are somewhat imaginative. This can not make up for the boring game play and downright buggy control system.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,WonderwallWeb,50,If you’re a scream at the TV throw the controller stamp on your Xbox kind of person it’s probably best to avoid this offering.
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Game Chronicles,43,If you love giant bugs and the whole saving the damsel in distress and dont mind shoddy graphics dismal sound and repetitive gameplay give it a shot. But youve been warned.
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Games Master UK,43,A terrible Mario Party clone that offers nothing for gamers over five. [Nov 2007 p.85]
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Nintendo Gamer,40,It might be simple repetitive and nowhere near worth the asking price but Urban Champion is a pleasant enough retro diversion for half an hour or so. [Oct 2011 p.76]
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Multiplayer.it,40,A good idea in terms of graphics and concept doesnt always determine a good game and Lucha Fury stands as an example of this. Charming and interesting to see this game is simply and sadly not entertaining to play.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,PSX-Sense.nl,50,There are a few cute things in here but overall its more of Cluster F.ck than a Fluster Cluck... if that makes sense.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,GameSpot,42,Its an unusual idea and certainly an interesting one but as you play youll find that Combat Medic probably wasnt the best idea for a game.
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,55,An intriguing narrative is interrupted by long bouts of boring wave-based shooting against generic enemies in dull locations. I can’t help but think of the early moments in Ian’s house seeing ceramic horrors in reflections and being excited for a cinematic psychological-horror action game that would never come to be.
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,Play UK,47,As much as we enjoyed Dead Space and look forward to its sequel this really is a poor effort from Sumo Digital and Visceral Games. [Issue#199 p.103]
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,GameTrailers,40,It’s a grind that’s just not much fun to play no matter how much ghost riding the whip takes place. Pimp My Ride falls a few rims shorts of a set.
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,40,Battle for the Pacific brings zilch to an already overstuffed corner of the market. Dont let the discounted price or the The History Channel branding fool you the game is a poor attempt at historical immersion.
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Worth Playing,40,A terrible awful game.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,Cheat Code Central,48,With no opening or closing ceremonies or otherwise flashy presentation the game is as boring to look at as it is to play.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,Games Master UK,60,Get past the obtuse mechanics and theres a unique retro charm here. [Feb 2012 p.97]
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,InsideGamer.nl,47,This game is better than its predecessor but that does not mean it is great. Its short the story mode is minimal and the fighting system is way too simplistic to be enjoyable.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Game Informer,55,The sounds graphics and controls are all painfully ported from the PC and all of them are worse for wear. [Apr 2003 p.89]
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,GameSpot,40,This wacky action game doesnt contain any of the fun hinted at by its goofy premise.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,IGN Italia,49,Despite the four-year break from NBA Live 10 the Electronic Arts basketball series is back in late 2013 with an awful new episode. Ugly to see and hear and flawed in artificial intelligence and gameplay NBA Live 14 finds some interesting elements only in Scenario Mode and Ultimate Team but NBA 2K14 does much more ten times better and even if EA Tiburon has promised patches and updates the feeling is that the NBA Live series is now dead and buried.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Lamely executed. [July 2016 p.94]
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Game Chronicles,45,X-Men: Destiny is a budget-priced offering wrapped in a full-priced package. By no means is it worth the $49.99 MSRP – which is a real shame given the excellent source material Silicon Nights had to work with.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,IGN,47,This game is literally you punching as your favorite member of the Fantastic Four for hours on end.
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Console Monster,45,Blue Omega Entertainment set out with a clear goal to change the First Person Genre with a mix of FPS and Acrobatics; unfortunately Damnation falls short on both counts and leaves gamers wanting their money back.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Game Revolution,42,I was happy that The Shield made great use of its police officer premise but the game really wore me down. It probably doesn’t deserve a critical thrashing but the gameplay and story can’t compete on today’s shelves.
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,35,It may be fun if we play with friends for a few hours… but it may be not. There are many games fighting in the FPS genre and its very hard to find something worth highlighting in this one.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Its actually quite enjoyable at points. It just feels short and ultimately a bit pointless. [Issue#67 p.105]
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,IGN,40,Had this actually been a game that was comparable to Rock Band 3s Pro mode but with a real six string guitar then I would be thrilled. But instead its an overpriced low budget music game with tacked on power chords.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,GameZone,60,Air Conflicts could have been a great flight-combat sim seeing as all the right elements are present but there are way too many obstacles that make flying these unfriendly skies too boring. Plagued with a number of frustrating problems this is a game that fans of the genre should skip.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,Play Magazine,50,When you take into account the humor the budget price and the ability to beat your (least) favorite celebrity into a bloody clay pulp theres certainly fun to be had. [Dec 2003 p.81]
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,TotalGames.net,46,The fact that the game is so difficult is purely down to the excruciatingly painful controls.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,Nintendo Power,45,Theres no platforming no puzzle solving no backtracking no nothing: you just work your way across the stage until it abruptly ends. [Dec 2009 p.89]
Hollow,Switch,Feb-22-2018,MMEU,Action Adventure | Survival,FNintendo,40,Hollow could have gone further and cemented itself as a good proposal in the growing horror genre within the Nintendo Switch and it gets the ambiance right including the good use of sound effects. It does not succeed at all it could unfortunately as its heavy and cumbersome gameplay losses of fluidity and several technical issues end up plaguing the experience whose plot is also too generic and unremarkable to make this a memorable horror game.
Legends of Pegasus,PC,Aug-10-2012,Kalypso | Novacore Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | 4X,Everyeye.it,50,Legends of Pegasus could be a great game but at the moment suffers for too many bugs. Interesting for the future once patched.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,Xbox 360,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,Worth Playing,50,If youre looking at this as a music game stick with either Rock Band or Guitar Hero. They might not feature real guitars that you can plug into an amp but at least youll get a better gaming experience and more players with whom to share the experience.
Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Total Video Games,40,Its ill-thought from the very start which is demonstrated by the contradictions and flaws evident throughout the entire game.
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,GameCritics,45,Alekhines Gun stole from the best but didnt know what to do with the spoils of its crime. The story is interesting and the levels are playable thanks to the source material being just that good but its missing the spark and attention to detail which made Hitman such a phenomenon. The copycat locations may look better than the originals but the gameplay simply isnt there.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameZone,60,There are more flaws in JMSW than there are good gameplay mechanics. Although the odds were against it JMSW turned out to be an above-average game.
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,43,This exotic pedigree gives Torrente the game an air of intrigue that eclipses the final product which turns out to be a typically rotten movie-licensed budget shooter.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Digitally Downloaded,50,That being said though this is not a fantastic game by any account and while there’s a little fun to be had in a frantic online match there are much better ways to get your competitive shooter fix.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,LevelUp,40,Risen 3: Titan Lords disappoints on even the most basic elements which perhaps with a little more time couldve been fixed. Its a shame because we can tell that deep inside lays a game that tries to offer hundreds of hours of fun. Sadly though the only surprising thing about this is that it found its way to the shelves.
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,GamePro,40,Double D Dodgeball should be skipped. Certain gimmicks like skill shots and a variety of arenas do not add enough to warrant a purchase.
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Nintendo Life,30,Arc of Alchemist is not worth your time. We’ll say it again just in case the people in the back didn’t hear: Arc of Alchemist is not worth your time. The story is barely serviceable the gameplay is middling and uninspired at its very best and the graphics often look like they could’ve been pulled from an early 3DS game. That would all be damning enough if it at least ran well but Arc of Alchemist in fact runs at laughable framerates all the way through. That would be damning enough but then the developers have the gall to ask you to pony up forty bucks (at time of writing) for this mess. The Switch library is packed to bursting with loads of fantastic RPGs that are each sure to deliver a great experience. This is definitely not one of them. Please don’t waste your money on Arc of Alchemist.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,BonusStage,47,The fighting mechanics are highly outdated and just dont reach to the heights of something like VF4.
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PlayStation Universe,40,Eternity The Last Unicorn is a hot mess of a game with old school graphics and game mechanics that feels more dated than a launch title from the original PS1.
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,PlayStation Country,40,Tokyo Tattoo Girls promises a lot but delivers very little. It appears to be a strategy game but it basically plays itself with only minor input from the player. Some strong artwork at least makes the short playthroughs relatively enjoyable just dont expect it to tax you.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,Eurogamer Italy,40,Terrible useless boring. This would be enough to discourage the purchase of One Piece but what must also be added is the total lack of content.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Worth Playing,40,Infernal: Hells Vengeance has a neat premise and thats it. The gameplay is botched in every conceivable way and the graphics and voice acting will grate on you endlessly.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpy,45,Is Tsunami 2265 totally devoid of value? Not completely but its close.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,n-Revolution Magazine UK,48,Amusing enough for half an hour or so but ultimately the repetitive stunting crashing and bone smashing becomes wearisome. [Issue#21 p.88]
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Worth Playing,47,For non-gaming dorks out there looking for some amusement in this title the sonic aspects of it are where its at.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Next Level Gaming,45,Besides the fact that I should never be able to sit down and beat a game in my first sitting theres absolutely nothing that makes me want to go back and play it again.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,IC-Games,45,Started with brilliant presentation and gameplay and deteriorated from that point on. Although the novel twist of trying to save the ‘bad’ kids does add something for fans of the book they’ll be advised to rent this title before the sugar sweet memories turn into a sour aftertaste after shelling out for this lacklustre platformer.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,45,The whole game looks like it was hastily moulded out of plasticine. [Sept 2007 p.70]
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,Gamers' Temple,40,Dead Space Ignition is not worth the purchase unless you want to get the unlockable content for Dead Space 2 but if you want the unlocks then you may as well just pre-order Dead Space 2 and get Ignition for free. Play the game long enough to secure your unlockables and then go play something else.
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,COGconnected,45,What 7 Days to Die does right is provide a hearty selection of crafting and allows you to team up with friends locally or online to enjoy some co-op action. But is it worth picking up? For the simple fact that there’s better examples of world-building engines out there with a large fan base and even larger servers I say pass.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GamerWeb Sony,50,There are so many profane adjectives that could be used to describe this horrid title but I’ll try to keep it to a minimum.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Console Monster,48,It is quite a poor game mainly due to the longevity though being a budget title – I wasn’t expecting a masterpiece.
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer 2.0,42,There’s not really much more to say about the game other than just ranting about our horrible experience with it. Surely that would bore you our respected readers. We’re actually somewhat sorry that you’re being exposed to this game in the first place. Please look elsewhere for gaming if you want to do yourselves a favor.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Xbox Achievements,50,Enemy Front is a disappointing shooter that has a few good ideas but can’t implement them well enough to make it stand out from a very large crowd.
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,GameZone,45,Even on the Nintendo Wii the game just doesn’t possess the true essence of what makes a good boxing game work on the Wii. Do yourself a favor boxing fans and stay away from this one.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,IGN,35,Unfortunately a promising set of images couldnt prepare us for an absolutely lousy playing game of b-ball on the Game Boy Advance possibly beating out the 16-bit era NBA Jam clones as the worst of the bunch.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Next Level Gaming,50,Theres two cops Mike and Marcus. Wheres the two player simultaneous co-op mode?
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Not really worth investigating. [March 2012 p.91]
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Play (Poland),40,Its a shooter utilizing the CryEngine 2 and featuring one hard-as-nails mega-macho-man with a huge gun for a hand. If this description made you smile youll cringe anyway when you see how many bugs can be squeezed into every single map and how thinly can a texture be drawn. [May 2009]
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Planet Xbox 360,51,With the wealth of FPS options for 360 owners Battle For The Pacific is hardly worth a passing thought.
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,DarkStation,40,Girl fight is a difficult game to recommend. It’s clear to see where the developers were drawing their inspiration however they have succeeded only in creating a game which emulates the bigger budget titles on a very basic level.
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,IGN,45,Some good some bad. It all washes out to be somewhere around mediocre. (Just under mediocre actually. The negatives outweigh the positives in the end since no game should be so dark and drab that it forces you to have to crank your TV up to brightness level 99.)
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,Hobby Consolas,41,We are sure that La Ruina is a pick up artist but he didnt pick our interest for that matter. It will work as a manual for someone we suppose...
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,Game Informer,55,A flat-out crappy game. [Jan 2004 p.135]
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Vandal,40,This 3D shootem up has relative freedom of action and good graphics but lacks in gameplay mechanics.
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,Da Gameboyz,45,The problematic controls somewhat bland visuals and forgettable sounds all lend to a game which is going to become bargain bin material sooner than one may hope.
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,FNintendo,40,Bringing Langrisser out of Japan after 25 years is worthy of praise but unfortunately its the only thing worth praising about Langrisser Re: Incarnation Tensei. Its gameplay mechanics force the player to follow a pre-set order to move the characters rather than allowing for a more dynamic choice its visual environment needs a near-complete overhaul and its chapters are simply not motivating to move forward.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Play.tm,40,Sadly Rebellions staid middle-of-the-road performance continues with Shellshock 2: Blood Trails which although not unequivocally broken is so thoroughly unappealing and last generation that its all-but guaranteed a well-deserved place amid the lower echelons of gaming mediocrity.
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Hardcore Gamer,40,Fireburst is mediocre at best playable whenever you have friends over but not necessarily a first choice in anyone’s library. With the lack of any real story or campaign mode and busted online features there are games that do a lot better than this offensive boring and buggy arcade racer.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,games(TM),40,Its only when the game reaches Soviet-occupied Afghanistan the weakest of the movies that the game boasts moments of genuine enjoyment. [Issue#146 p.119]
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,PC Gamer,40,This gameworld is essentially a bad parody of a David Lynch production. Every scene is draped in weirdness wallpaper. It’s weird all right but not exactly engaging.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,44,Another videogame based on a popular motion picture another bad review score. Even though it has no shortage of bullets The Expendables 2: The Videogame fails to hit the bulls-eye. This 4 player co-op shooter is no action hero.[October 2012 p.79]
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GameSpy,39,Even by GBA standards leaves its players sorely wanting.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Games,49,Boring and buggy third-person-action-adventure that features two different characters one action-focus the other one stealthy. But the much too hard difficulty level and the more than stupid AI tear every bit of fun out of Shadow Harvest.
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,IGN,40,There’s nothing natural about AI that faces the wrong way in combat or a shooter who doesn’t know what gear he brought into combat or squad members who can’t communicate. When shooting for authenticity a half step is not enough.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,44,Repetitive and uninspired missions abound as do glitches that can make completing missions more difficult or even impossible without reloading. The lack of a co-op mode for the campaign is also a huge letdown.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,40,You can send out fellow survivors on scavenging missions the downside of this is that they can fail or even worse die. Unfortunately the number of goods they collect is so abysmal you wont care if they make it back or not. [May 2013 p.88]
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Xbox Tavern,45,Past Cure offers an interesting story one that’s buried deep underneath a plethora of technical issues and poor execution. Despite a few intriguing moments within this game is nowhere near as exciting as it makes out to be. It’s over-priced and over-hyped.
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,GameSpot,40,Ironically while this penguin-themed puzzle game seems geared toward younger players it may be too challenging for the average kid.
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Generación Xbox,43,Agony promised a lot but it fell short and failed to meet expectations. Lots of bugs and inconsistent quality.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,48,Trust me you arent missing anything by passing this game up. Optimus Prime is dead and its this game that killed him.
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,Play Magazine,45,Man what a stinker. [Nov 2007 p.114]
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Nintendojo,45,If you really want a good Astro Boy handheld experience pick up Astro Boy: Omega Factor if you can. Otherwise you would be better off looking elsewhere for a platforming experience on Nintendo DS.
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,AceGamez,40,A proper next-gen update to the classic franchise is something Id love to see but with its myriad of flaws and questionable change in style this game simply doesnt cut the mustard.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Nintendo Life,40,The nature of Fantasy Hero ~unsigned legacy~’s mission based structure lends itself well to the pick up and play style of Nintendo Switch but there’s nowhere near enough compelling content here to make it worth your time. A dull plot filled to the brim with typical JRPG tropes fails to give you much of an incentive to progress while the combat itself is far too basic and at times punishingly difficult. This may have been a passable experience upon its original release but in 2018 this port has little to offer.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,39,Neither quality fan service nor a good action game on its own merits The Shield fails miserably to live up to its licenses pedigree.
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Meristation,35,Girl Fight is a bad copy of some fighting games. Simple and poor gameplay generic visuals with few issues in stages and animations and only the most basic modes available.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,PSM Magazine,50,You know somethings wrong when the most interesting character is the nerdy scientist with knee-high socks. [Sept 2004 p.26]
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,Xbox Nation Magazine,40,The game is riddled with more holes than poor Loose Lips Larry. [Feb 2005 p.89]
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,TeamXbox,40,A horrible game? Not at all... Some positives include its clean look tolerable music and ease of play. Anyone can pick it up and start playing.
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Everyeye.it,45,AMY is a total delusion: poor game design and a underwhelming graphic trasform an hyped game in one of the worst digital delivery game of this winter.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,IGN,40,Kick-Ass is a poor beat-em-up that feels rushed at every turn.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,Pocket Gamer UK,40,Its less to do with being the Man of Steel more a rusty version of the tin man – because this is a game without a heart.
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,Gamers.at,52,Of course we anticipated for this game to be bad – but honestly even for a movie tie-in this is just ridiculous. It deserves to go straight to the wastebasket.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Yahoo!,50,Its not all bad just needlessly frustrating. Once you get your head around the controls and deal with some of the flawed game mechanics Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing becomes mildly enjoyable.
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,MondoXbox,50,Farming and breeding must be a very boring and repetitive activity or at least this is what Farming Simulator 2013 makes us believe. Giants Software made a pretty impressive reproduction of the farming activities and tools but they totally forgot that a game needs to entertain or at least involve its public.
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,GameWatcher,40,X: Rebirth will get better over time and anyone who’s open-minded enough to look past the ‘X’ branding and see the ‘game’ may even find many hours of entertainment.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,SpazioGames,48,Dawn of Fear in a true old school survival horror but is literally devastated by too many technical flaws.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,Cheat Code Central,40,From the gameplay to the graphics Van Helsing is one poorly developed game. I dont even care what the excuses are this game should not have been released in the state that its in.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,GameNow,42,I was even less impressed by the games fighting system. There isnt an ounce of technique involved. Just walk up to an enemy and rapidly punch it until it goes down.
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,All Game Guide,50,Unfortunately the flaws especially in the more difficult battle scenarios make the idea of replaying somewhat moot.
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,GameSpy,40,The idea is solid but the haphazard controls suck most of the enjoyment from these rails. Wed like to see more dragons in our games but requiring the use of an ice pack after bouts with the stylus seems unnecessary.
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Italy,40,Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified is one of the worst chapters of this popular franchise. The short campaign and the clumsy multiplayer are lethal shots to the poor PS Vita existence.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameZone,50,The interface is barely useable and the combat is a fairly simple affair. The graphics are weak and though the story is interesting you will probably not want to play through the game to see the plot go forward.
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,GameSpy,40,If you like fighting games pick up another one.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,GameZone,48,No tutorial no use of the sixaxis wingmen that would just as soon walk into a wall as fight things are looking pretty bleak. Melee combat with weapons is impossible to work.
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Weve reached the point in the 360s lifecycle where even movie tie-ins have decent graphics. Too bad that the only part of Megamind: Ultimate Showdown that doesnt totally suck. [Feb 2011 p.83]
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,Game Chronicles,45,And while the FMV movies are definitely worth checking out – if only to laugh at their ridiculousness – it is not worth plunking down $40 for.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Worth Playing,40,Iron Man for the PC is another casualty in the sad and lengthy history of failed movie-game tie-ins.
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Yahoo!,40,A mediocre game at best. Graphically and sonically it stinks but with a better framerate these issues and enemy AI problems could have been forgiven.
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Everyeye.it,40,Rough around the edges would be an understatement. Sadly its just hard to find a reason why you should play Rekoil given the abundance of choices in its genre.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,Hardcore Gamer,40,If you’ve got the tolerance for terrible and the four hours or less that it takes to beat the game maybe you’ll have fun groaning at how bad Zombeer is too.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),40,Unfortunately this niche sport has spawned a niche game that lacks the more obvious draw of the beach variant and will interest only the hardest hardcore fans. [Nov 2008 p.83]
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,IGN,40,Not only did it skip over the elements that make the TV show so memorable in terms of its presentation but it wasnt much fun to play either.
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,Gameblog.fr,40,Weeping Doll had good ideas and a good horror atmosphere but the game lacks ambition and finishes after only 40 minutes!
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,DarkStation,50,Battling zombies should be an exciting and frightening experience but instead turns into a farce with laughable AI and linear gameplay.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,4Players.de,55,The concept actually works. The change of perspective as well as the new art direction build a solid foundation. But under the surface nothing really comes together.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,Multiplayer.it,40,Simply put Sonic Boom is one of the worst Sonic games in recent memory: the concept is bland the design is awful and the execution is incredibly poor.
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Generación Xbox,40,The Deeli Network studio has suffered from inexperience and wanted to cover too much in this first title staying halfway through it all.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Age,33,While the concept sounds like fun nothing works how you think and it ultimately turns into an unenjoyable experience. I really cannot recommend this one on any level.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Worth Playing,40,This isnt a game as theres no real reward for doing well other than unlocking more tests and its not really a brain-training device because it doesnt teach you anything.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,MondoXbox,45,The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is based on a good idea - wed love a good TWD survival game - but with a very poor execution.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,PC Gamer,53,Its individual parts are pure hit-and-miss but if you overlook the misses and get on with killing bad guys youll have a good time. [July 2003 p.82]
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Eurogamer Italy,40,Poor gameplay uncertain graphics terrifying voice-over and a problematic control-schema: considering the intolerable lack of Chuck Norris rejection is the only choice.
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,Worth Playing,35,There is absolutely no reason to purchase Jenga World Tour over a copy of the physical game. The latter is cheaper less painful on your eyes and significantly more fun.
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameTrailers,44,With sub-par controls an unattractive presentation and nothing to do but fight the same simplistic and unrewarding fights over and over again Fighters Uncaged is a stumbling failure akin to a fighter whos doomed to a forgettable career as a low-ranking amateur.
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Worth Playing,40,BMX Challenge is not interested in style quality or progress. It feels like a lost project from the me too era of five years ago when every other company was looking to break into the genre.
Coliseum,PC,Jan-6-2004,Stormcloud Creations,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing,Game Over Online,48,It’s flawed and it’s buggy and there just isn’t enough to do in the game to make it fun.
Kabuki Warriors,Xbox,Nov-19-2001,Light Weight,Action | Fighting | 2D,Xbox Exclusive,50,Even though this isnt a fast paced game and you may find it to be a little more dragging than your usual fighting game the different objectives that you complete in your fights are something that is fairly new and innovative.
Pool Party,Wii,Sep-5-2007,SouthPeak Games | Hyper-Devbox,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,GameSpot,50,Twitchy controls and poor presentation eclipse what little fun there is to be had with this middling billiards game.
Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,RPGamer,30,The more one looks back on it the more it feels like Magus primary purpose was to acquaint a new development team with the tools at hand while building up a few skills.
Ghostbusters,Xbox One,Jul-12-2016,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,ICXM,50,Demanding $50 for Ghostbusters which is clearly designed as a much smaller title is unforgivable and honestly approaching fraud.
The Simpsons Wrestling,PlayStation,Apr-12-2001,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,PSX Nation,70,The game is like a very sweet cake. The first bite is sorta nice and sweet but then its just too much and you dont want anymore.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,PlayStation 4,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,PlayStation LifeStyle,40,Despite the fun character customizations Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5 suffers from a number of issues including laggy multiplayer dipping frame-rates and off-putting physics. Sorry Tony but nostalgia can’t save you this time.
Toy Shop,DS,Apr-29-2008,Gameinvest | Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,30,Normally when someone has to experience this level of tedium and frustration they at least get paid minimum wage. Instead youll have to buy Toy Shop if you want to have all the monotony of working a terrible job in the palm of your hand.
The Asskickers,PC,Jul-21-2011,AGO Games,Action | Fighting | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 2D,Gaming Nexus,42,Amusing for a short period of time the Asskickers will ultimately wear out its welcome in your gaming agenda in just a few hours or plays. Its a fun reminder of what the beatem up genre has to offer but will unfortunately remind of what is wrong with it as well. Die hard beatem up fans only need apply... and even they wont be entertained for long.
