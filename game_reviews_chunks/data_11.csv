Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Konami,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,Worth Playing,62,When it comes right to down it DanceDanceRevolution: Universe 2 is the type of game that only series fans will love. If your idea of a fun evening is laying down a dance pad and stomping around until the downstairs neighbors call the cops then this title is right up your alley. However if you are not nor have you ever been a professional dancer theres very little here to make this title worth your time.
Genesis Alpha One,PlayStation 4,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Everyeye.it,60,Not always fascinating.
Dr. Luigi,Wii U,Dec-31-2013,Arika | Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,Gamereactor Sweden,60,Germ fighting with Luigi offers good fun but Dr Luigi is way over prized and you can easily get more and better similar puzzle games for less than a dollar/euro. This is just not worth the cost for Wii U it doesnt have enough content.
Armored Core 4,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2007,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Game Informer,65,Multiplayer is what’s really going to get the fans riled. After fine-tuning your ideal mech in single player you can bring it online and face off against anywhere from one to seven opponents. Unfortunately there’s not a whole lot of match variety outside of deathmatch and team deathmatch and there’s no respawning so matches don’t last much longer than five minutes tops.
Kill la Kill: IF,Switch,Jul-26-2019,Studio TRIGGER | Aplus,Action Adventure | General | Action | Fighting | 3D,PLAY! Zine,60,For the fans of the Kill la Kill anime this would be a great and fun game to have and play with friends. Its button mashy system and crazy action are well presented. But lack of playable characters and high price tag drag it down for now.
NASCAR 09,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2008,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Stock Car | Stock Car | Automobile,Game Chronicles,63,Yes there are a lot of features that really make this game fun and interesting but there are a lot of other racing games that will hold your interest longer and are more entertaining.
Mazes of Fate,Game Boy Advance,Dec-6-2006,Sabarasa Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,IGN,65,Its a game built for the fans that grew up playing classic games on early computers. For many gamers it may be a title their father will find more interesting than they do.
198X,Switch,Jan-23-2020,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,Vooks,60,Ultimately I did enjoy my time with 198X. Much like my own youthful trips to the arcade it dazzled me briefly but cuts itself short before delivering a substantial experience. What it does succeed at though is decorating itself in a pastiche of ‘80s arcade hits with a brilliant aesthetic and authentic retro remakes. The $15 price isn’t outrageous but the short runtime might be enough to convince you to wait for a sale before pumping those hard-earned coins.
SingStar Celebration,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,Critical Hit,70,If this is a celebration then its a muted one. Im not sure Singstar will ever relive its glory days but Celebration is a decent karaoke game that doesnt need extra accessories and peripherals. Its fun and infinitely better than singing along to your favourite song on the radio pretending your hairbrush or potato peeler is a microphone.
Pro Cycling Manager Season 2013: Le Tour de France - 100th Edition,PC,Jun-20-2013,Cyanide,Alternative | Biking | Sports | Individual | Biking,Gamereactor Denmark,60,If you are crazy about the tour then Le Tour de France 2013 - 100th Edition is a decent take on the cycling sport. Unfortunately the mechanics of the game aren’t very well explained and even if it is fun at times managing your resources it never fulfills its potential.
Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor - Martyr,PlayStation 4,Aug-23-2018,Maximum Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General,PSX-Sense.nl,65,If youre looking for longevity then look no further. The lore is interesting enough to continue playing. The audiovisual design is well done and even though the game is pretty difficult newcomers wont be scared off by it. Technically there are plenty of issues. Frame rate hiccups long load times a copious amount of screen tearing and lacklustre matchmaking are our major gripes.
The Baconing,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Eurogamer Sweden,60,Deathspank: The Baconing is a fun game with first class humour that gets dragged down by repetitive combat. Brilliant in small doses though.
Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo,Wii,Oct-20-2009,Media Vision,Action | Adventure | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Nintendo Power,65,Its a shame that Revenge of King Piccolo becomes essentially a mediocre fighting game in the latter part of the adventure. [Dec 2009 p.88]
Heavy Weapon: Atomic Tank,PlayStation 3,Jun-11-2009,PopCap,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Video Game Talk,60,If Heavy Weapon feels like an online Flash Game at any time you’ll be happy to know that it basically is. There’s fun to be had here for sure but it’s not the same type of fun that you get from a long epic story.
Skelattack,PlayStation 4,Jun-2-2020,Ukuza,Action | Platformer | 2D,Comicbook.com,60,Skelattack is a great-looking albeit completely frustrating game that will surely delight and infuriate folks. Even though I tossed my controller aside more than once in my playthrough I can’t help but feel the allure to try again. I know I’m going to grunt and moan the entire time but the look and lore of this game are too much to ignore despite my complaints.
Fragments of Him,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Sassybot,Adventure | Visual Novel,DarkStation,60,If you can forgive the technical faux pas the somewhat creepy mannequin people the absence of any memorable music and the bare bones gameplay theres a fantastic story buried underneath the rubble. All of the characters are three dimensional and real the voice acting feels authentic and the writing is smart but never preachy. At its core Fragments of Him is just a poignant story of love and loss. It showcases Will and his partners relationship as normal and pedestrian. Its almost mundane. But this approach is all the more effective when something that should just be normal and average is treated as such. Based on the title of the game you can kind of assume where the narrative is likely heading to but the journey there while bumpy is one worth taking.
Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2014,Aqua Plus,Real-Time | Fantasy | Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | Visual Novel | General,Everyeye.it,65,Western tastes wont have an easy time connecting to this typically eastern product. In the end its more a visual novel than a truly interactive game and that calls for very specific tastes.
Band Hero,DS,Nov-3-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,AtomicGamer,62,Overall Band Hero on the DS is a step in the wrong direction for portable music games. Theyve tried to go big on the peripheral front but in doing so theyve excluded a huge chunk of gamers in a wide range of ages.
Aven Colony,PC,Jul-25-2017,Mothership Entertainment,Strategy | Management | Government,Game World Navigator Magazine,65,Boring sandbox mode is partly compensated by the campaign: in each mission developers came up with new ways to complicate the life of the colonists while at the same time unraveling a story about the imminent end of the world and the search for alien artifacts. [Issue#223 p.60]
Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe,3DS,Aug-29-2014,HAL Labs,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,FNintendo,60,Dededes Drum Dash Deluxe may not be plentiful as far as its contents are concerned but what is to be found here is entertaining enough to keep any kind of player happy throughout some quick gaming sessions.
Antigraviator,PC,Jun-6-2018,Iceberg Interactive,Racing | Arcade | Futuristic,DualShockers,65,Antigraviator is a no-holds-bar dedication to arcadey futuristic speed. But packing in more content would elevate the experience to something better.
Obscure,PlayStation 2,Apr-6-2005,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror,IncGamers,60,If you are sceptical of games that feature co-operative multi-character play you neednt worry too much; its handled reasonably well.
How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition,PlayStation 4,Nov-4-2014,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Survival,LaPS4,63,The great amount of walking dead related products in recent years seems endless. How to Survive takes its place among the zombie comics movies and TV shows mixing enough genres to work quite well even though it might be quite expensive for what it really is a PlayStation 3 game.
Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes,Wii,Oct-12-2010,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,3DJuegos,67,Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes gets the Dynasty Warriors formula and changes the face. It is extremely funny and it will attract the lovers of this genre but this game is really poor in IA lack in innovation and really repetitive and linear.
Bee Movie Game,PlayStation 2,Oct-30-2007,Beenox,Action | General,TotalPlayStation,65,Far far better than the odds would suggest and though its not all perfect whats there is certainly worth picking up if you enjoyed the movie and want something to play with the kids.
Crash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2007,Radical Entertainment,Action | General | General,GameZone,64,Save for the cooperative mode there’s not much here worthy of a gamer’s time that is devoted to buying and renting the best games.
NHL 08,PC,Sep-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,NZGamer,61,A pretty average affair. Fun can be had if you’re really into your hockey but there are better games to choose from.
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Gaming Age,58,If the gameplay was a little more involved with less button bashing and greater emphasis on using combos for effectiveness it would provide a more fufilling experience.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PC,Nov-15-2001,KnowWonder,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpy,68,The game runs poorly on just about any machine.
Stretch Panic,PlayStation 2,Aug-28-2001,Treasure,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Gaming Age,58,Here is proof that originality alone is not a basis for a fun game.
Off-Road Redneck Racing,PC,May-2-2001,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Computer Games Magazine,60,Provided you keep the sound on mute pump up the resolution and have a few hours to spare this is decent down-home motor madness served the finger lickin way.
Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition,Dreamcast,Oct-28-2000,Climax Entertainment,Driving | Mission-based,Dreamcast.net,62,This title has so many graphical bugs and glitches that I wonder how it even managed to make it here from Japan in the first place.
Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour,Dreamcast,Jul-19-2000,Crystal Dynamics,Driving | Racing | Kart,IGN,63,Ripped directly from the soundtracks in Disney Studios the score is clear authentic and most definitely happening.
Afro Samurai,PlayStation 3,Jan-27-2009,Namco Bandai Games America | Namco Bandai Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Play UK,61,It’s a great-looking game thick with atmosphere and brilliant music. Sadly someone forgot to show as much care to the gameplay so only fans of the comics and TV series are likely to finish the adventure with much satisfaction.
Brothers in Arms: D-Day,PSP,Dec-5-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,60,A solid attempt to bring the gritty realism of war to handheld but shooter-nuts are better off sticking with Medal of Honor Heroes. [Jan 2007 p.88]
Lovely Planet,Xbox One,Jan-8-2016,QUICKTEQUILA,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine UK,60,A tough cookie. As a twitch game it suffers from poor feedback and imprecision but its snappy pace keeps you hooked. [March 2016 p.86]
Mini Ninjas Adventures,Xbox 360,Jun-29-2012,Side Kick LTD,Action | General | General,Multiplayer.it,65,Pretty tower defense like game with Kinect sensor. Hiro is back and your arm is now the katana. Just beware the considerable physical effort!
Powerstar Golf,Xbox One,Nov-22-2013,Zoe Mode,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade,COGconnected,69,Powerstar Golf has a strange addictiveness to it.
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,Xbox 360,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,games(TM),60,The one area it does get right is the driving. [Issue#115 p.99]
Dead Space 2: Severed,PlayStation 3,Mar-1-2011,Visceral Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Visceral chose to stay so close to whats gone before. [May 2011 p.112]
Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli,Wii,Aug-26-2008,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Other | Other | GT / Street | Automobile,Eurogamer,50,If you can get used to the nunchuk and remote as a surrogate wheel then the experience is passable but nothing more.
Just Cause 4,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gamer.no,60,Just Cause 4 is a big dumb and lovely action game that offers hours of great entertainment for those willing to look past its blemishes and technical faults.
Tekken Hybrid,PlayStation 3,Nov-22-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Gamereactor Denmark,60,A mediocre movie a re-release of and old classic and a demo of an upcoming game. Thats what Tekken Hybrid contains and whether you should get it depends entirely on how much you miss playing Tekken Tag Tournament. If you dont theres little reason to pick this up unless you really really love everything related to the Tekken games and universe.
Brave: The Video Game,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,Disney Interactive Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Linear,COGconnected,65,Brave possesses a unique charm and should be considered if you are on the lookout for a well made kid-friendly title to add to your collection.
Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code,PSP,Mar-28-2006,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,G4 TV,60,The biggest sticking point is that Untold Legends has been told before several different times in several different guises. While improved from its predecessor Warrior’s Code is not quite up to the level of a Diablo Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance or similar hack-and-slash titles.
Skully,Switch,Aug-4-2020,Finish Line Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cultured Vultures,60,While the voice acting storytelling and platforming in Skully is top class the visual issues might cause you to lose your head.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2,PlayStation Vita,Aug-18-2015,Frima Studio,Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,PlayStation Universe,65,Resident Evil: Revelations 2 on PS Vita is a flawed port that only comes recommended if it’s your sole option of playing the game.
Farming Simulator 2013,PC,Oct-25-2012,Giants Software,Miscellaneous | General | Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,You can find a lot of educational value in this simulation but as entertainment it just doesn’t work – its more edutainment than a game. [Jan 2013]
Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Battle March,PC,Sep-2-2008,Black Hole Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN AU,63,Ultimately Battle March has added a new single player campaign a little meat to the multiplayer and two new factions to take control of.
Crayola Treasure Adventures,DS,Oct-1-2007,Crave,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,60,Only inflict on youngsters when youre absolutely desperate. [May 2008 p.75]
Delta Force: Xtreme,PC,Apr-22-2005,NovaLogic,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,G4 TV,60,A budget title and it plays like one. Every feature this game has to offer has been better implemented elsewhere.
Battleship,Xbox One,Aug-2-2016,Frima Studio,Miscellaneous | Board / Card Game,Areajugones,65,Battleship is a game with fancy graphics and some innovative ideas but it doesn’t stand out in any aspect. A game for fans only.
Depth,PC,Nov-3-2014,Digital Confectioners,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,58,Depth is a Left 4 Dead clone sunk by its sea of flaws.
Titan Quest,Switch,Jul-31-2018,THQ Nordic,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GamePro Germany,61,Quotation forthcoming.
James Bond 007: Blood Stone,PlayStation 3,Nov-2-2010,Bizarre Creations,Action | Driving | Shooter | Mission-based | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamer.nl,60,Blood Stone feels like a Bond-movie directed by Michael Bay. The game opens impressively with variety in surroundings and the perfect Bond-vibe. But after an hour the lack of deep gameplay becomes grating and the shooting parts dont offer anything you havent seen anywhere else before. Furthermore the racelevels are downright disappointing and the only gadget in your possession is useless.
ZEN Pinball 2: Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron,PlayStation 4,Apr-22-2015,Zen Studios,Action | Pinball,GameCritics,50,Fans of the blockbuster might enjoy the set dressing applied to this pinball table but those looking for a solid pinball board underneath the veneer might be left wanting.
Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave Incident,Wii,Jun-29-2011,Sanzaru Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Hidden Object | Puzzle | General,Nintendo Gamer,64,Not too taxing but well made. [Aug 2011 p.73]
Zombie Panic in Wonderland,Wii,May-3-2010,Akaoni Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Eurogamer,60,Zombie Panics gleeful initial charm and quirky visual appeal wane once the frenzied bullet-spraying repetition kicks in after a couple of stages. Its evidently one of those games best sampled in small doses.
Daemonica,PC,Mar-31-2006,Cinemax | RA Images,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Gamer 2.0,70,We like Daemonica for its refreshing variations on tired themes and a sincere attempt to introduce a nifty potion-mixing element into its chilling story.
Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta,Xbox 360,Aug-3-2009,Bethesda Softworks,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,VideoGamer,60,Mothership Zeta is a let down. Its nowhere near as good as Point Lookout or The Pitt. Its slightly better than Operation Anchorage but only slightly. Its a linear repetitive slog through an alien space ship and nothing else. Is it a fitting finale? No. Is it worth 800MS Points? Just. If only for the Samurai Armour. Sniff.
Urban Trial Tricky,Switch,Jun-25-2020,Tate Multimedia,Sports | Individual | Biking,Starbit,60,Urban Trial Tricky is simple...simple and fun and its good at what it does. While the game doesnt harbour AAA ambitions this is without a doubt a very fun way to pass some time and to enjoy the kicks and adrenaline rushes given by performing stunts on a bike. The experience would be better if the levels felt a little less claustrophobic but as a quick fun experience Urban Trial Tricky is a welcome addition to the Nintendo Switch catalogue.
Dead or School,Switch,Mar-13-2020,Studio Nanafushi,Action Adventure | General,God is a Geek,65,If you enjoy gameplay focused experiences and can tolerate some jank Dead or School will be worth getting when it drops in price.
Conarium,PlayStation 4,Feb-12-2019,Zoetrope Interactive,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,TheSixthAxis,60,Conarium is a good example of a Lovecraftian game. It focuses on the atmosphere and lore that characterises the genre whilst mostly avoiding the worst excesses. It tells an intriguing story well despite the slightly dodgy voice acting and presents a good approximation of the impossible non-Euclidean geometry of the Elder God’s world. If you like a touch of Cthulhu in your life then you could do worse than venturing into Conarium’s brand of madness.
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,PC,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Total Video Games,60,Fun to play in the short term especially over the course of a mission or two theres a repetitiveness to the gameplay that fails to entice players to experience the campaign for hours on end.
Serious Sam: Next Encounter,PlayStation 2,Apr-22-2004,Climax Group,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Play.tm,60,It is cheap and cheerful but it ultimately fails to do itself justice on the PS2.
Naval Ops: Commander,PlayStation 2,Mar-9-2004,Micro Cabin,Simulation | Ship,GamerFeed,60,Had the graphics been retouched a bit the pace been picked up the sound been reworked and multiplayer been considered this couldve been the luxury yacht of war games.
Conflict: Desert Storm II - Back to Baghdad,PC,Oct-7-2003,Pivotal Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameSpot,63,At least the PC version is easier to play thanks to the wider array of control options offered by the keyboard and mouse.
Disciples II: Servants of the Dark,PC,Jun-30-2003,Strategy First,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Deeko,65,The single player mode is lacking in many ways and feels disjointed as if the missions should have just been in the original game.
Worms Blast,GameCube,Oct-24-2002,Team17,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,IGN,58,You can get involved in some pretty intense matches but the gameplay does not lend itself to be longlasting like some of the other addicting puzzlers out there.
Mega Man X6,PlayStation,Dec-4-2001,Capcom,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameShark,61,If youre a Mega Man fan then youve already purchased the game and have been playing to your hearts content. You can move on to other parts of the web-site.
ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2001,Konami,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,IGN,58,There are honestly a lot of things to like about this football game...[but] it just doesnt play enough like real football.
Tetris Worlds,Game Boy Advance,Sep-5-2001,3d6 Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,Nintendo Power,60,New variations make Tetris Worls a world of fun. [Nov 2001 p.148]
Razor Freestyle Scooter,PlayStation,Dec-11-2000,Shaba Games,Action | General,Gaming Age,67,RFSs gameplay is completely off the wall fun and despite its quirky premise kept me coming back for more time and time again.
Gunman Chronicles,PC,Nov-19-2000,Rewolf Software,Action | General | General,ActionTrip,69,If we take it for what it really is - a mod then one could label Rewolfs baby as a nice mod success story with mediocre retail reach and appeal.
Eat Them!,PlayStation 3,Dec-21-2010,FluffyLogic,Action | General | General,Everyeye.it,60,Eat Them! shows how Rampage worked only in the context of the penny arcade and in his time. The title of FluffyLogic fun and entertaining but the fun turns out to be ephemeral and not permanent.
Trillion: God of Destruction,PlayStation Vita,Mar-29-2016,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Vandal,65,Trillion: God of Destruction is an experimental RPG so it gets a few things right but misses a few others. Still if you connect to the characters its a good adventure that feels original within the genre.
Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns,DS,Jul-22-2008,Ninja Studio,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Roguelike,IGN,60,The gameplay visuals and style of the game have remained nearly identical to the previous package so while we like what we’ve played once again it’s undoubtedly more of the same.
007: Quantum of Solace,DS,Nov-4-2008,Vicarious Visions,Action | Action Adventure | General | Modern | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Pocket Gamer UK,60,Some nice ideas and a relatively fresh approach to the Bond franchise but there are just too many rough edges to the core action to recommend a purchase.
Fossil League: Dino Tournament Championship,DS,Jan-22-2007,MTO,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,62,Fossil League is essentially a Pokemon clone thats pretty decent on the surface but lacks the depth features and polish of the original monster-battlers. [May 2007 p.85]
Eternal Poison,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2008,Flight-Plan,Strategy | General,GamePro,70,The gothic-anime art direction and voice acting are impressively well-done and although the painfully long load times hinder the general flow of the game-play the overall game-play soundtrack voice acting and art direction makes up for the technical deficiencies.
Axis & Allies,PC,Nov-2-2004,TimeGate Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,GameSpot,60,The single-player portions of the game are ridiculously easy even on the hard settings. Only a few campaign missions are remotely challenging and even these cases are due to poor AI with Allied forces.
Journey of a Roach,PC,Nov-4-2013,Koboldgames,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Gameblog.fr,60,Quotation forthcoming.
MotoGP 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-28-2008,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Gameplanet,65,An inauspicious beginning for Capcoms new motorbike series that has little to offer even committed fans.
Dig Dug: Digging Strike,DS,Oct-18-2005,Bullets,Action | Platformer | General | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Game Chronicles,61,There just isn’t all that much substance and certainly no flash with Namco’s latest retro invasion on the DS.
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts,PlayStation 4,Nov-22-2019,CI Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,XGN,65,While its shooter mechanics and open mission structure make the game fun to play. There are also plenty of technical flaws or poor design choices that ruin that same fun experience. Glitchy maps weird AI movements and a poor story make this shooting adventure feel mediocre instead of great.
Battle Princess Madelyn,Switch,Dec-20-2018,Causal Bit Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,60,Battle Princess Madelyn is not without its problems. While its arcade mode is easily the most enjoyable it also ends up defeating the purpose of including a metroidvania component in the game. With a high difficulty level and some memorable cut scenes it also has some gameplay issues that require solving and which stand on the way of making this a more recommended title.
Poi: Explorer Edition,Switch,Oct-23-2017,PolyKid,Action | Platformer | 3D,COGconnected,65,I was looking forward to reviewing Poi: Explorer Edition as a game that channels the old-school 3D adventure game I loved so much as a child sounded like a great thing. However this game is less a channeling and more a full emulation of one of those older games. It’s good for some fun though that fun won’t last long. It’s not completely broken but the minor issues can add up in a hurry. There’s some enjoyment to get out of Poi: Explorer Edition but it’s more of a nostalgic trip to a more innocent time than anything noteworthy in the present.
Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,Namco Bandai Games | Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,ZTGD,65,I was glad to see that SAO:HF was able to put forth a more earnest effort with its improved translation and gameplay tweaks but when it’s all said and done it’s still not a particularly good game.
Fairy Fencer F,PlayStation 3,Sep-16-2014,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,IGN Italia,61,Made with impeccable richness and dolled up with cut-scenes and distracted fine ladies the new Compile Heart JRPG is not fully convincing presenting a solid gameplay without a challenge equally worthy. And in the absence of this balance Fairy Fencer F loses a lot of biting especially in the second half of the adventure.
A Virus Named TOM,PC,Aug-1-2012,Misfits Attic,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,Gamer.nl,65,A Virus Named Tom is a nice puzzle game as a snack. Its structure is simple and it never gets very complicated. Still theres enough challenge in this relatively short game and the multiplayer lifts it to greater heights. Unfortunately the versus and coop modes are only playable locally and for a PC-game thats a giant waste.
Shotest Shogi,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2008,AI Factory | Rubicon Development Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,60,Itll be big in Japan; over here not so much. [Christmas 2008 p.94]
007: Quantum of Solace,PlayStation 3,Nov-4-2008,Treyarch,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GamingExcellence,64,For Bond fans the complicated controls lack of an original story and mediocre graphics may cool the ardor for owning any and all Bond-related products.
Barnyard,Wii,Dec-4-2006,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action | Adventure | General | General,GameDaily,60,Regardless of its shortcomings Barnyards mini-games and activities on the farm make it worth at least a rental. Just accept the fact that bovines ride bikes and mix drinks.
Pac-Man World 3,Xbox,Nov-17-2005,Blitz Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Game Informer,63,The dialogue is actually charming and sometimes clever but the loose controls found in the main game also plauge the arcade port to a degree which to me is the biggest bummer of this outing. [Jan 2006 p.138]
Dynasty Warriors 9,PlayStation 4,Feb-13-2018,Omega Force,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 3D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,This is a big game. Sadly its not all of the highest quality. Sometimes less is more. [March 2018 p.94]
Super Motherload,PlayStation 4,Nov-15-2013,XGenStudios,General | Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action,GamesRadar+,60,Super Motherloads premise of digging for richs on a lonely planet sounds about as boring as actually digging for richs on a lonely planet. But stick with it long enough and youll find an eerily soothing adventure with addictive strategy elements that make for a wholly enjoyable next-gen gaming experience.
SingStar Dance,PlayStation 3,Nov-1-2010,SCEE London Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Dancing,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),60,Were convinced that theres nothing brilliant about the SingStar series. And yet Dance is a good time. [Jan 2011 p.84]
War the Game,PC,Jan-12-2015,GabberGames,Strategy | Real-Time | Military,SpazioGames,70,Going beyond the minimalist technical sector this is an absolute deep wargame despite the extremely simple gameplay. Its all about the ideas that underlie it that as in the best milestones pass over all the rest to give a deep and original product like few others.
MachiaVillain,PC,May-16-2018,Wild Factor,Action | General,COGconnected,66,Ultimately MachiaVillain needs a lot of cleaning up explanations and balance fixes. Then maybe we can all come together to have a bloody good time.
Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D,3DS,Jun-28-2011,Capcom,Action | Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Shooter | Survival | Third-Person | Tactical,Digital Spy,60,While Resident Evils gameplay is a little on the clunky side today its still wholly enjoyable and packed with thrills and its just a shame that its short-lived and awkward to get to grips with.
Cate West: The Vanishing Files,Wii,Mar-23-2009,Destineer,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,GameSpot,60,If youre itching to play a hidden-object game The Vanishing Files will be like rubbing up against a tree: its not pretty but it gets the job done.
Birthdays the Beginning,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Arc System Works,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon | Action Adventure | Sandbox,Eurogamer Italy,60,We cannot say that Birthdays is one of the best God-game available. The ground modeling represents basically the whole gameplay. For the rest of the time you will stand still waiting for the life to blossom.
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,Xbox,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Armchair Empire,67,Gladiator was on its way to becoming the sleeper hit of 2003… then the gameplay threw it into the bargain bin.
EyePet & Friends,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,SCEE London Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),60,We occasionally encountered some control issues. [Jan 2012 p.81]
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands,PSP,May-17-2010,Ubisoft Quebec,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,65,The well-designed levels in The Forgotten Sands do a good job of sucking you into this 2D world but minor control issues and lame combat distract from the fun.
The Escapists: The Walking Dead,Xbox One,Sep-30-2015,Team17,Action | General,Brash Games,70,A great title that remains true to the source material and one that fans of both the Escapists and the Walking Dead will love. Whether the daily grind of washing dirty clothes and working out in the gym will be for everyone else is another question but this unusual and unique take on one of TV’s bests is at the very least a fun and challenging RPG.
Exit 2,Xbox 360,Feb-25-2009,Taito Corporation,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,IGN,65,Exit 2 doesnt feel like a sequel as much as more levels with a few added twists. All of the issues from the original are back: The controls are awkward. The pacing is horrid. The AI needs work. But hey at least a good number of the puzzles are interesting and there are a lot of them.
M.A.C.H. Modified Air Combat Heroes,PSP,Feb-20-2007,VU Games,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Other,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Theres just no lasting appeal. [Apr 2007 p.97]
Help Wanted: 50 Wacky Jobs,Wii,May-12-2009,Hudson Soft,Simulation | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,65,Do minigames become more playable when coupled with a story that would have cinema goers lobbing popcorn at the screen? Answer: not really. [May 2009 p.60]
Gauntlet,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,Digital Eclipse,Action | General | General | Arcade,IGN,60,Visually and aurally the game is pretty much the same as before. Of course running the game on an HD set will make it sharper but this game still looks and sounds much like it did in 1985.
Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain,PlayStation 2,May-4-2004,Sony Bend,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,Game Power Australia,65,If the control had been more intuitive and the combat had been tightened up the game could have been more enjoyable but as things stand most should give Sonys new shooter a wide birth.
Lords of the Realm III,PC,Mar-17-2004,Impressions Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General,IGN,64,Without offering a little more depth to either the tactical or strategic aspects of the game were left with two experiences that are integrated well enough but leave us wanting more.
Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus,Xbox,Mar-18-2003,Studio Gigante,Action | Fighting | 3D,G4 TV,60,Its not deep or particularly innovative. However the detailed graphics familiar gameplay and wide variety of characters and game modes make this brawler worth a look.
Strike Fighters: Project 1,PC,Oct-27-2002,Third Wire,Simulation | Flight | Old Jet | Combat,GameSpy,60,Clearly missing some pieces but the product may be salvageable.
S.W.I.N.E.,PC,Nov-19-2001,Stormregion,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Tactics,Game Over Online,64,A funny but repetitive (and eventually tedious) real-time strategy game.
Tennis Masters Series,PC,Nov-18-2001,Microids,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,Computer Games Magazine,60,The game could have been stellar but it falls flat in one critical area. You never ever hit a ball out.
Hoard,PC,Apr-4-2011,Big Sandwich Games | Inc.,Action | General | General,Gamekult,60,Quotation forthcoming.
Juiced: Eliminator,PSP,Jun-28-2006,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GameSpy,60,Its too bad the core driving model is so flawed since Juiced could have been a lot more fun with either tighter handling or more spacious course designs.
Party Hard,PlayStation 4,Apr-26-2016,Pinokl Games,Action | General,Brash Games,50,Party Hard is not a bad game by any means but it’s just not a particularly fun one. Without that addictive ‘one more go’ feeling that other games of its ilk employ so effectively Party Hard becomes much more of a chore than a game about murdering a drunken party should.
MS Saga: A New Dawn,PlayStation 2,Feb-21-2006,Bandai,Role-Playing | General,Gaming Horizon,62,I remain unimpressed by MS Saga: A New Dawn as well as the Gundam series its based upon. While Bandai has crafted a playable game with some points of enjoyment the majority of its content is extremely dull and flat.
Away: Shuffle Dungeon,DS,Oct-30-2008,Mistwalker | Artoon,Role-Playing | General | General,1UP,67,Shuffle Dungeons strength lies in its level designs which are cleverly crafted so as to force tough choices at the spur of the moment. The limited structure grows a bit long in the tooth once youve been playing for a while...but even so it never stops pushing you to make those snap decisions.
Wild West Guns,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Gameloft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,1UP,58,Considering the production values and repetition Wild West Guns is probably pushing it with a $10 price point but for those looking to swap their virtual crossbow for a slightly less-enticing six-gun this throwback shooter very nearly justifies the investment.
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PSP,Dec-11-2005,Crave,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,IGN,65,It certainly falls short on some of the presentation points like its minimalist character creator and restrictive Career mode options but its AI and fairly cool RPG elements make it stand out from the portable crowd a bit.
Crash 'N' Burn,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameSpot,67,Unfortunately some of Crash N Burns central ideas--the persistent wrecks being the most obvious example--introduce complexity that in the end will leave you more frustrated than thrilled.
Need for Speed Underground 2,DS,May-10-2005,EA Canada,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Nintendo Power,60,The mixture of shame and frustration it instills will make you raise your eyebrows turn on your heels and snicker as you walk away. [July 2005 p.99]
Painkiller: Overdose,PC,Oct-26-2007,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,60,The Painkiller series has indeed overdosed and should have been stopped after the first two games.
Bee Simulator,Switch,Nov-12-2019,Varsav Game Studios,Simulation | General,Pure Nintendo,60,Bee Simulator’s flying mechanics will frustrate younger gamers and its grade-school level presentation will turn away adults. If you’re able to find some happy ground between the two of them however it’s a thoughtful educational and fun way to live out the life of a bee.
Morphite,Switch,Nov-2-2017,Crescent Moon Games,Action Adventure | General,Switch Player,58,Morphite is a space exploration adventure that does well in creating the feeling that you’re visiting its many alien worlds. With a unique low poly style it falls short for having poor and inconsistent combat. Those that can overlook this will find a deep and enjoyable journey.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,DS,Nov-14-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,netjak,65,For every new innovation solid gameplay design and visual accomplishment there’s another half-hour of gameplay that seems just like the last.
Arena Football,Xbox,Feb-7-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,GameShark,58,Despite the fact that the game has a franchise mode of sorts (you sign free agents in the off season rather than holding a draft) this isnt the kind of game that youll most likely play multiple seasons as you would Madden or NCAA unless youre simply a die-hard Arena League fan. The game simply doesnt have the legs for it.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1: In Too Deep,Xbox One,Feb-23-2016,Skybound LLC | Skybound Games,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,COGconnected,65,In Too Deep isn’t by any means terrible it just doesn’t feel as original or as interesting as it should. It’s also quite possible that I’m simply over-saturated with The Walking Dead in general right now.
Sparkle 2,Xbox One,Jan-27-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Puzzle | Matching,Brash Games,60,Sparkle 2 is not a game that is going to keep you entertained forever but as a stand alone puzzle game it’s a great time filler amongst the other titles that you may be wanting to play.
Prince of Persia Revelations,PSP,Dec-6-2005,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Fantasy | Linear,IGN,60,While the scope and impressive design of the game remains intact theres a myriad of technical issues that rob much of the enjoyment. Everything from the visual presentation down to the core gameplay has been adversely affected in the transition from consoles to a portable system.
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2005,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,PALGN,60,The fact that it was finished last year and released in Japan in 2004 and left until now with no changes is just one of god’s mysteries.
Outward,Xbox One,Mar-26-2019,Nine Dots Studio,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Survival | Open-World,Official Xbox Magazine UK,60,A tense and immersive adventure – but with one too many rough edges. [Issue#177 p.85]
Choplifter HD,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2012,InXile Entertainment,General | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Eurogamer Sweden,60,An attempt to bring a classic game to a new audience that early on looks like a solid and fun game but after a while shows its not so polished design. What was addictive and challenging in the early 1980s does not fly today. The somewhat cluncky unprecise controls and inconsistent difficulty level makes Choplifter HD a games that initially lifts off with confidence but crashes halfway through and never really gets some air beneath its rotors.
Cookie & Cream,DS,Jul-2-2007,Hi Corp,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Nintendo Power,65,If you crave innovation and have the patience to deal with Cookie & Creams shortcomings the title offers a creative charming and mostly satisfying adventure. [July 2007 p.93]
Secret Files: Tunguska,Wii,Jun-22-2010,10tacle Studios | Fusionsphere Systems,Adventure | Third-Person | General | Modern,AceGamez,60,There are problems but fans of the genre will be able to look past these imperfections and see that this is a far superior game to Agatha Christie. But even so this is still an average game especially when compared to the best of the Wii library.
Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon,PC,Aug-21-2008,Kheops Studio,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,Game Over Online,62,Almost nothing about the game is fun or enjoyable -- the puzzles are a chore the storyline is presented badly and even the ending is annoying -- and so I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody unless for some reason you like being lost and confused.
The Awakened Fate: Ultimatum,PlayStation 3,Mar-17-2015,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | General | Roguelike,Slant Magazine,60,It leans firmly enough on its heaven-or-hell selection phases to make an impact in both the immediate and distant future of its gameplay.
Blacklight: Tango Down,PC,Jul-14-2010,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,65,Blacklight: Tango Down is a decent cheap multiplayer shooter for the budget-minded gamer looking for a change of pace.
Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,PC,Jun-10-2016,Frogwares,Adventure | General,GRYOnline.pl,65,Sherlock Holmes: The Devils Daughter is an uneven game. Making Sherlock younger and having him take part in action scenes was a good idea but the execution is poor at best. Still there are some excellent mini-games interesting investigation and a truly great deduction board. If only the game handled its characters better it would be glorious. The end result is ok but the potential is far from being fully realized.
Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond,PlayStation 3,Jan-7-2010,Vicious Cycle,Action | Action Adventure | Modern | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GameSpot,60,This satirical shooter is fun but it never takes advantage of the potential of its parodies.
Blair Witch,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Good ideas are undermined by overuse and a lack of tension but Blair Witch does leave you thinking ‘What if?’ and demands to be replayed . [Issue#171 p.97]
Metal Wolf Chaos XD,PC,Aug-6-2019,From Software | General Arcade,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,PC Invasion,70,Metal Wolf Chaos XD isnt particularly lengthy or challenging but its very entertaining and downright hilarious. As long as youre okay with playing whats mostly a straight port of an Xbox game from 2004 theres a good time to be had here.
Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 2,Xbox One,Feb-5-2019,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Jeuxvideo.com,60,Milestone is obviously on the good path. Monster Energy Supercross has many things to improve on but there’s at least an interesting Career mode and more realistic driving.
Smash Hit Plunder,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,Triangular Pixels,Strategy | General,COGconnected,60,SHP may provide a diversion to youngsters for a short while but everyone else will quickly wander off for more fulfilling experiences. It’s a shame too because the tone and look of SHP deserve a better game.
Gekido: Kintaro's Revenge,Switch,Mar-22-2018,Naps Team,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Cubed3,60,It may be a mediocre brawler of its time but it does have a certain energy to it and the light adventuring elements do make it unique from anything else of its ilk. The bonus dungeon mode is the real main attraction and playing with a friend makes things more interesting. Kintaros Revenge can only be recommended though to gamers who understand that this is a port of a Game Boy Advance title that has not had much done to its presentation.
Human: Fall Flat,Switch,Dec-7-2017,No Brakes Games,Action Adventure | General,IGN Spain,60,An experiment made video game. A strange but fun experience that gains whole thanks to its physics engine and a hilarious cooperative mode.
Star Wars Battlefront II,PC,Nov-17-2017,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Quarter to Three,60,Oh and my sweet Lord this game does wonders in the space battles department. You’ll fly around Star Destroyers and through Death Star debris zipping between laser blasts and missiles. Eventually just as in Galactic Assault in Starfighter Assault games you’ll spawn in hero ships like the Millenium Falcon and Slave I. Or that one green ship that looks like a bathtub turned upside down. Is it Bossk’s ship? Regardless you can fly in it if the cool ships are taken.
Xenoraid,PlayStation 4,Nov-8-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons Ltd | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Everyeye.it,60,A traditional vertical shooter with a single good idea but many gameplay flaws restrained by an anonymous and unattractive look.
Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,ACE Team,Action Adventure | Linear,GamingTrend,65,Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition is fun at times but ultimately an unsatisfying affair.
War for the Overworld,PC,Apr-2-2015,Subterranean Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Classical gameplay is wonderfully revived with new features and dressed in a modern jacket. Unfortunately technical aspects and other issues undermine the games legs. [Issue#252]
Rio,PlayStation 3,Apr-12-2011,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Miscellaneous | General | General,Gamereactor Denmark,60,A better party game than we expected but not quite as good as it could have been. The joy you get from the bubly music and colorful graphics fades away once youve reached the end of the minigames and see how much they recycle their ideas.
Rogue Ops,GameCube,Oct-29-2003,Bits Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,GamingWorld X,69,And while Rogue Ops is still often a blast to play the game’s lack of polish and numerous minor frustrations noticeably hamper the solid if somewhat derivative gaming experience that lies underneath.
Summer Heat Beach Volleyball,PlayStation 2,Jul-1-2003,Acclaim Studios Cheltenham,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,GameNow,67,What it lacks in curves and naughty bump-mapping it makes up for in sheer gameplay. [Sept 2003 p.54]
Gungrave,PlayStation 2,Sep-16-2002,Seta Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Playboy,65,Suave and stylish courtesy of character designs by famed anime artist Yasuhiro Nightow (Trigun) its unfortunately far too short underwhelming and the general aesthetic is liable to be beyond the comprehension of anyone who couldnt tell a Gundam from a gumball.
Mad Maestro!,PlayStation 2,Mar-12-2002,Desert Productions,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,After a few songs keeping tempo and varying the strength with which you hit a single button gets pretty old. [May 2002 p.101]
Darkened Skye,PC,Jan-27-2002,Boston Animation,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Fantasy,Adrenaline Vault,60,If you can get past the monotonous arcade elements theres a lot that the title has going for it including imaginative characters and a script bordering on hysterical.
Monsters Inc. Scream Team,PlayStation,Oct-30-2001,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General,TotalGames.net,58,A deeply unsatisfying experience although younger players may have some fun just running around as Mike and laughing at his crazy antics.
Thunderstrike: Operation Phoenix,PlayStation 2,Oct-15-2001,Core Design Ltd.,Action | Simulation | Shooter | Flight | Third-Person | Helicopter | Modern,GameZone,59,A game that suffers from could have been great syndrome. The weapons are cool and the missions are exciting but the controls ruined everything.
Yoshi's New Island,3DS,Mar-14-2014,Arzest,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cheat Code Central,62,Yoshi has had some grand adventures of his own but sadly this is not one of them.
Alpha Protocol,PlayStation 3,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,GameSpot,60,Alpha Protocols astounding intricacies are tarnished by bugs clumsy gameplay mechanics and rough production values.
Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2014,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Shacknews,60,Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn is sure to be a welcome return for some but the rust is clearly showing on this series.
F1 2015,Xbox One,Jul-21-2015,Codemasters,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,MondoXbox,69,F1 2015 lays good foundations for the series future on new consoles but it still needs a lot of work. Too many bugs and the absence of the Career mode one of the most loved in previous games make it hard to suggest it even to the biggest Formula One fans.
Monopoly Streets,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,Electronic Arts,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Absolute Games,60,If you love Monopoly but couldnt care less about online play get a 2008 version. It makes no sense to pay extra for pretty much the only new feature.
Danger Zone,PC,May-29-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,GameSpot,60,The old magic of Crash Mode rises to the surface often enough for Danger Zone to be a fun diversion but this excitement is ironically muted when the game decides to turn up the intensity in its later levels.
Diner Dash: Sizzle & Serve,DS,May-23-2007,Climax Group | PlayFirst | Climax Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General | Action,GamesRadar+,60,Most levels in Diner Dash: Sizzle and Serve last five minutes tops which makes it a flexible on-the-go offering. We’re increasingly annoyed by publishers’ tendencies to toss a casual PC game onto portable consoles for a notably higher price than its PC version.
Mario Party 7,GameCube,Nov-7-2005,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Party,N-Europe,60,Basically Mario Party 6 but with less fun and [fewer] new ideas.
Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis,PC,Oct-29-2009,Fusionsphere Systems | Animation Arts,Adventure | General | General,Vandal,60,Ultimately if Secret Files was a surprise for its good presentation and story this sequel was expected to follow its trail. However this Puritas Cordis shows it is not enough to reuse the same formula over and over.
Spyro: A Hero's Tail,Xbox,Nov-3-2004,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,TeamXbox,64,A Heros Tail does a good job at starting to expand Spyros world in a few new directions with additional playable characters but its just a start.
Onimusha Tactics,Game Boy Advance,Nov-11-2003,Capcom,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,60,If youre looking for a game that wont overtax your brain then OT is the way to go.
AO Tennis 2,Switch,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,Nintenderos,60,A port that doesnt stand out in the graphic and technical section. However its gameplay is wonderful for lovers of pure and realistic tennis.
Bloo Kid 2,3DS,May-7-2015,winterworks,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameCrate,65,While the game borrows some of the best elements from Mario and Kirby (among others) it also suffers from some nasty issues of its own. The unpredictable nature of the games obstacles and artificial difficulty do more harm than good resulting in a product thats only good for short sessions rather than simply being an overall great game.
Naval War: Arctic Circle,PC,Apr-10-2012,Turbo Tape Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General,Eurogamer Italy,60,Not a deep RTS game but a little bit more complex than a casual game Naval War is an average title. It can be funny but out there there is for sure something better.
Go Vacation,Wii,Oct-11-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Nintendojo,58,As a mini-game compilation Go Vacation falls short of the standard set by Wii Sports Resort due to its middling selection of activities and its frustrating motion controls; as a sandbox game however it fares significantly better offering up four expansive resorts to explore and a myriad of collectibles to find. While its extensive use of gesture commands nearly ruins the entire experience there is still quite a bit of fun to be had with the title particularly if you have a companion to share it with.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Autobots,DS,Jun-23-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Adventure | Shooter | Beat-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person | 3D | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,64,Though the game moves in a completely linear fashion with quite a few missions that arent very enjoyable to run through there are other elements of the game that are admittedly compelling and addictive.
Gear.Club Unlimited,Switch,Nov-21-2017,Eden Games Mobile,Action | General | Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Vooks,60,Ultimately Gear.Club Unlimited may have been better served doubling down on either the arcade or the simulation aspects of driving not both. In attempting to do both Gear.Club Unlimited stretches too thinly in trying to cater to both crowds creating a merely serviceable package filled with content brought down by unsatisfying driving.
Lucky's Tale,PC,Mar-28-2016,Playful Corp.,Action | Platformer | 3D,Multiplayer.it,63,Though Luckys Tale is a decent platformer its too short and doesnt have original ideas. But its for free so go and download it.
Crystal Quest,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2006,Stainless Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameSpot,62,A solid game that could have used some better presentational aspects. When put up against the surprisingly deep competition for this style of game on Xbox Live Arcade it falls a little flat.
Atari Classics Evolved,PSP,Dec-19-2007,Stainless Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Console Gameworld,60,A pretty standard classics collection. On its own its exceedingly average but if youve got a soft spot for one or more of these games the awards might make it worth your time.
Dusk Diver,PlayStation 4,Oct-29-2019,JFi Games,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,RPGamer,60,Dusk Diver inevitably invites comparisons to both Persona and Yakuza. Yet this isn’t necessarily a bad thing as while it doesn’t have the thematic aspirations of the former or the writing and attention to detail of the latter the decent combat and low-key charm make it an overall pleasant experience that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Just keep in mind that it is very much cotton candy instead of a full-course meal.
Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2012,Pyramid,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Digital Chumps,62,I think passionate series fans whether Budokai veterans or not will appreciate the Collection but they may also question why a more thorough and complete version wasnt released.
Conduit 2,Wii,Apr-19-2011,High Voltage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer Portugal,60,The Conduit 2 is a significantly improved experience over the previous game though without adding anything new.
Defiance,PC,Apr-2-2013,Trion Worlds,Massively Multiplayer Online | Role-Playing | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Everyeye.it,65,Defiance fails in the difficult task of merging a TV series and a video game in a convincing and engaging way.
Battles of Prince of Persia,DS,Dec-6-2005,Ubisoft Montreal,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,Computer Games Magazine,60,It’s all in the cards. Play the campaign to earn them and then use them to build your decks. [Mar 2006 p.91]
Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Aspyr | Aspire,Action Adventure | Linear,Worth Playing,60,At its core Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast remains a good title. Get past the shooting and youre rewarded with a ton of Force powers and lightsaber combat that remains at the top of its field to this day. However the port job isnt up to snuff as it lacks some slight auto-aim and lock-on to make the experience more user-friendly for console players so the opening levels are a real chore to get through even if you can handle the outdated textures and adherence to the old way of doing puzzles. Not only is it recommended to go with the PC release for this title but it also gives one pause about how the eventual port job of Jedi Academy will turn out.
Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters: Daybreak Special Gigs,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Arc System Works | Now Production,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Gameblog.fr,60,Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters Daybreak Special Gigs is a superb Visual Novel with a good OST and original novel mechanics... But the tactical phases are boring and ugly and the story isnt that good.
Master of Orion 3,PC,Feb-25-2003,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | 4X,Adrenaline Vault,60,The elements for a great game are present but the focus and execution of those elements is not.
Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts,Xbox 360,May-17-2011,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,GamePro,60,Its a fair package -- more expansive than Dead Money but not quite as rich as Point Lookout which is the current gold standard for Fallout DLC. And of course its a long way from the expansion packs of yore where $30 could occasionally yield what amounted to an entirely new game. Ten dollars is a fair price for what Honest Hearts brings to the table but its ultimate appeal is down to whether or not youre still in the middle of a campaign. As it is this four hour romp through Zion National Park isnt quite worth dusting off your seven-month old copy of New Vegas.
Cargo! The Quest for Gravity,PC,Apr-21-2011,Ice-Pick Lodge,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | General | Fantasy,GameStar,64,Theres that feeling that I should have fun playing the game but most of the time Im bored or angry because the controls are buggy. But if you like to be creative maybe youll be happy in this colourful world.

StarDrone,PlayStation 3,Apr-5-2011,Beatshapers,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,64,While there isnt a whole lot you can do with a control scheme as simple as this StarDrone manages to add new challenges and interesting twists right up until the very end. Add some trophies to the mix and despite its flaws StarDrone is a pretty decent value for eight dollars.
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2004,Interplay,Role-Playing | Action RPG,G4 TV,60,When you play it in bite-size sessions youll appreciate wading into a sea of overgrown beetles or phosphorescent foes spiked baseball bat swinging. Despite a few design shortfalls the gameplay succeeds admirably as does its presentation.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,PlayStation 2,Dec-8-2003,Paradigm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Armchair Empire,63,The part of the game that annoyed me the most - long range combat.
Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm,PC,Sep-26-2002,3DO,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General,netjak,70,A fine piece of work but a little hastily put together...Due to the lack of a random map generator and due to the limited replay value of the maps the most you can get from the expansion is a week of playing.
ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,GameSpot,64,While Konami has toned down the simulation elements of Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002 so that it will appeal to a broader audience the challenging controls and plodding snowboarder mode will turn off all but the most ardent snowboarders.
Silent Scope 2: Dark Silhouette,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2001,KCET,Action | Shooter | Rail,Yahoo!,60,There arent really enough features here to recommend Silent Scope 2 to anyone other than those who are maniacally obsessive about the game ...or those rich I-Link-two-big-TVs-in-the-same-room-owning-people.
Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff,PlayStation 2,Apr-18-2001,New World Computing,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG,GamerWeb Sony,55,While some hardcore gameplay fans may appreciate the purity of this experience the plot and lack of characters is so glaring I find it hard to believe even so-called hardcore gamers wont find it annoying.
Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business,PC,Nov-30-2000,Sir-Tech Software Inc.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | Tactics,Computer Games Magazine,70,Delivers its moneys worth for true fans of the series but which is much too hard for anyone not utterly devoted to Jagged Alliance.
Assassin's Creed Liberation HD,PlayStation 3,Jan-14-2014,Ubisoft Sofia,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,PSX-Sense.nl,60,The PlayStation Vita version is faithfully ported to the PlayStation 3 and as it turns out does not make as much of an impression on the big screen. Ubisoft tweaked the free-running and combat aspects of the game though didnt bother fixing bugs and other shortcomings. Graphically its a totally expected letdown.
UEFA Euro 2012,PC,Apr-24-2012,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,Games.cz,50,A sloppy job done by the developers of Euro-licensed UEFA Euro 2012 is nothing more than an over combined gaming mode with the Czech national team. If you truly dont long for new graphics and the logo of this years European Football Championship save your money and keep playing FIFA 12.
We Cheer 2,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Machatin | Inc.,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,Digital Chumps,64,I think this game will satisfy the majority of the target audience with its customization options and modes of play. There arent a lot of songs here but the game is done well enough in every other respect to help make up for that.
Murder in the Abbey,PC,Aug-26-2008,Alcachofa Soft,Adventure | General | General,Absolute Games,64,Alcachofa Soft managed to produce only a half of a potentially great adventure. And I mean it literally - the two opening chapters are so different than the last two that you won’t believe your eyes.
Wild ARMs XF,PSP,Mar-11-2008,Media Vision,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,GamePro,60,Theres no doubt that Wild Arms XF is best left for hardcore fans of the series who will probably be more forgiving of the games faults; the rest of you should look elsewhere for your tactical RPG fix.
The Sinking City,PlayStation 4,Jun-25-2019,Frogwares,Action Adventure | Survival,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,Weaves Lovecraftian mythos into an interesting setting. But it frequently veers into being dull and repetitive which isn’t what you want from dreamlike horror. [Issue#165 p.89]
Corruption 2029,PC,Feb-17-2020,The Bearded Ladies Consulting,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,GameSkinny,60,Corruption 2029 is a competent tactical game that leaves you wishing it had spent just a little more time in development.
Urban Trial Freestyle,3DS,Jun-27-2013,Strangelands Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Driving | Racing | General | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Nexus,65,If you’re looking for a portable Trials game Urban Trial Freestyle isn’t a bad alternative. However the track designs could have been a little better and I’m appalled at the lack of multiplayer. A motocross game is a perfect example of a game to play with friends but apparently the developers didn’t think so.
The Legend of Korra,PC,Oct-21-2014,PlatinumGames,Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,GameStar,60,A solid core of action and an entertaining fight mechanics cant save the game from being mediocre.
Pressure,PC,Mar-26-2013,Chasing Carrots,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,DarkStation,60,All that being said the core of Pressure is a fun ride. Good mechanics go a long way towards making a great action-racer but the bumps along the road end up bogging this down at the end of the race.
Dragon Age II: Legacy,Xbox 360,Jul-26-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Action RPG,GameTrailers,59,Legacy is full of good intentions but the final presentation feels bland and rushed.
MXGP Pro,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Gamer.nl,65,MXGP Pro does not really deliver when it comes to game modes and presentation but it does have a good approach in physics and the versatility of this racing sport.
Chasing Aurora,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Broken Rules,Action | General | Flight | Flight,GameOver.gr,60,Chasing Aurora should be played by you and your friends then and only then it can deliver any amount of fun.
Deadcore,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2017,Grip Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameGrin,60,DeadCore is a challenging puzzle-platformer that really demands a high skill level of its player base. Visually is it incredibly uninspired and overly busy in places which can make the occasional frame drops quite frustrating. The mix between first-person shooting mechanics and freerunning platforming make the game a blast to play. For those who want a challenging platforming title on the PS4 DeadCore is right up your alley. For casual gamers out there I would recommend going elsewhere.
Sonic Heroes,PlayStation 2,Jan-27-2004,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Electronic Gaming Monthly,67,As with the previous two 3D Sonic outings Sonic Heroes is a solid platformer that couldve been a lot better if the developers had spent more time balancing the levels and tweaking the unbelievably frustrating camera. [Feb 2004 p.108]
Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness,GameCube,Sep-11-2002,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,Electronic Gaming Monthly,60,Its a simple concept that offers a fun twist on the falling-block model of a Tetris or Doctor Mario. [Oct 2002 p.194]
Triple Play 2002,Xbox,Mar-18-2002,Pandemic Studios,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Sim,Xbox Nation Magazine,60,As ugly as a Tim Wakefield knuckleball. [Spring 2002 p.91]
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PlayStation,Nov-15-2001,Argonaut Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Electric Playground,60,A PlayStation game that will disappoint Potter fans around the world with its bland graphics blocky characters lifeless locales frustrating challenges and uninspiring gameplay.
Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open,Xbox,Nov-14-2001,Rockstar San Diego,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Game Revolution,58,Excellent physics and suspension aggressive opponents and humongous and well-planned environments give a bit of shine to a game that is otherwise strictly last generation.
4x4 Evolution,PlayStation 2,Feb-26-2001,Terminal Reality,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Maxim Online,60,The game’s lack of realism (your cars can’t get damaged or dirty) takes away from that devilish feeling that you’re doing something naughty with the family car.
Gunbird 2,Dreamcast,Nov-17-2000,Psikyo,Action | General,Game Revolution,67,The game is really really hard but thats the nature of this genre. I just wish that there were more rewards for my efforts; it feels almost pointless to try so hard.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD Ver.,PlayStation 3,Aug-21-2012,Capcom,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,GameOver.gr,60,Its strange bizarre some would say but this old fighting game from Capcom still has some life in it. Too bad its way too overpriced.
Sid Meier's Pirates!,Wii,Sep-28-2010,Virtuos,Strategy | General | General,Level7.nu,60,Sid Meiers Pirates for Wii is partially a missed opportunity. The games a classic on PC but the Wii version feels a little unessecary since the new functions for this console doesnt add much to the experience. Theres a lot to do in this game and it can get you quite hooked but it could have been done much better.
SimCity,PC,Mar-5-2013,Maxis,Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,Post Arcade (National Post),60,You soon realize that control like your city isn’t all its built up to be. So much has been smoothed out that it doesn’t always feel like you’re running the show.
Gods Will Be Watching,PC,Jul-24-2014,Devolver Digital,Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,God is a Geek,60,Where Gods Will Be Watching is really testing though is in its almost impenetrable difficulty. There’s a fine line between challenge and frustration and sadly with all of its positives Gods Will Be Watching will leave you questioning whether its really worth it.
Planet of the Eyes,Xbox One,Sep-12-2017,Coco Cucumber | Cococucumber,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameGrin,60,This title is pretty and has decent platforming despite not pulling the player in or offering challenging puzzles. Simply put it does as much right as it does wrong. It’s short but it doesn’t overstay its welcome due to that. It’s too easy but it makes for a nice quick completion when you’ve got some extra time. Might not be a bad idea to wait for a sale and complete it in only a little bit more time than it takes to download.
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,PC,Oct-3-2012,Arkedo Studio,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Riot Pixels,60,Hell Yeah wouldve worked much better if it were a comic book or an animated movie. It is eye-catching and crazy just to the right degree but alas so primitive as a game.
Of Orcs and Men,Xbox 360,Oct-24-2012,Cyanide | Spiders,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG | Western-Style,GameSpy,60,Keep in mind that this isnt an everymans game -- its linear levels the absence of bundles of loot and even the quirks of its combat whittle down its potential audience -- but theres a lot to love about how this RPG sings the glories of the underdogs.
The Lord of the Rings: Tactics,PSP,Nov-8-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,Next Level Gaming,65,This game is simply trying to cash into the Lord of the Rings franchise so lets be smart enough and not fall for that old trick just walk on buy this one on the store shelves.
Musashi: Samurai Legend,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,60,Despite Musashis quirky look and interesting mechanics the elementary mistakes made with the camera and the poor pacing ultimately make the game feel more like its 1998 predecessor than a modern sequel.
SpongeBob Squigglepants 3D,3DS,May-17-2011,WayForward,Miscellaneous | General | General,GamePro,60,SpongeBob SquigglePants has a few problems that can be justified -- the lack of impressive 3D effects doesnt sting since the game includes a variety of cool art styles and the games derivation from the WarioWario formula can be forgiven since the core gameplay is entertaining. Unfortunately theres no good reason for the games biggest problem: the extreme dearth of content. At $40 theres not nearly enough of SpongeBob SquigglePants to justify a purchase.
Restaurant Empire II,PC,May-26-2009,Enlight Software,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,69,Restaurant Empire 2 is a little tricky to evaluate. On one hand you’re getting two games that give you glimpses of what it’s like to run dining establishments both of which manage to essentially get the job don and pack in a story to boot.
Disney*Pixar WALL-E,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Heavy Iron Studios | Savage Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameZone,50,But the game itself is not rewarding. The game is like so many with a license attached little more than a rental youll quickly forget.
Hardwood Hearts,Xbox 360,Dec-8-2005,Silver Creek Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Board / Card Game | Gambling,GameSpot,61,Hardwood Hearts is a Hearts game for Hearts fans. If you dont already play Hearts you arent likely to get much out of this one.
SIMULACRA,Switch,Dec-3-2019,Kaigan Games OU,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,Twinfinite,60,Its story is creepy and unpredictable with the variety in gameplay keeping you engaged even if it drags towards the end.
Snooker 19,PlayStation 4,Apr-16-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,TheSixthAxis,60,Snooker 19 is a solid snooker simulation that will definitely appeal to fans of the sport. The relative lack of modes and some major oversights do hold it back and so it is difficult to recommend unreservedly. It might be Lab42s first attempt with the official license but right now Snooker 19 feels too much like style over substance. Not so much a 147 as a battling 50 ending in an unfortunate in-off whilst amongst the reds.
The Council - Episode 5: Checkmate,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,XGN,60,The final episode of The Council differs from the other episodes in tone and length and is kind of a let down. It is too short and there are too many abrupt changes in Checkmate to conclude it in a satisfying way.
Grand Ages: Medieval,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2015,Gaming Minds Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General,PSX-Sense.nl,65,An elaborate strategy experience hurt by mediocre graphics and a disappointing fighting system. Its a shame we cant properly read the letters on the screen either.
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,By far the biggest blot on WRCs copybook is the lack of variety on display. [Dec 2011 p.114]
Alien Breed 3: Descent,PC,Nov-17-2010,Team17,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,SpazioGames,65,Its still a good game but this third chapter should have been something more in terms of new ideas and polishing.
Kholat,PC,Jun-9-2015,IMGN.PRO,Fantasy | Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Gamer.nl,60,The world of Kholat is magnificent but the promises of a cool story and memorable gaming experience do not really come true. Using the map and compass are fun but frustration and boredom are near. Too bad because especially the Dyatlov Pas-incident is a good subject for a game.
Sid Meier's Starships,PC,Mar-12-2015,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,IGN,65,Sid Meier’s Starships’ battles held my attention for a handful of games after which point the tactical AI’s behavior became exploitable and the strategic layer became too muddled and unpredictable.
Infliction: Extended Cut,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2020,Caustic Reality,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Malditos Nerds,60,The biggest flaw in Infliction: Extended Cut are its similarities to so many other games. Many of its mechanics and design decisions have already been seen but players who love horror will be hooked by its creepy atmosphere and story.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,PC,Jun-30-2009,EA Bright Light,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer.nl,60,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will give fans some enjoyment but it doesnt offer much challenge and the story is told in a lackluster way. However the games visual presentation is impressive and the offered mini-games are fun to play.
Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species,PC,Oct-19-2005,Blue Fang Games,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,65,There are some good additions but stuff that I would have expected to be added on top of a different major theme. I guess when it comes to zoos its a little harder to find new topics for great expansions.
Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight,PlayStation 4,Jul-7-2017,Artdink,Role-Playing | Action RPG,The Games Machine,65,Accel World VS Sword Art Online has a decent and enjoyable combat system but everything else is definitely sub-par: the graphics seems to be coming from the previous PlayStation and the world is dull and pretty anonymous. Probably slightly more interesting if youre a fan of the series.
Yosumin! LIVE,Xbox 360,May-27-2009,Square Enix,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Edge Magazine,60,The concept at the core of Yosumin Live is robust but it fails to hold up under extended play. Either Square Enix has happened upon a brilliant mechanic that has yet to fully bloom or one that it has been unable to sustain. The scant progression Yosumin has made in its transition from webgame to XBLA release indicates that perhaps it is the latter.
SingStar ABBA,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2008,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,GamesRadar+,60,We applaud the focus but the flip side of that is a narrower market and decreased value to those of us who don’t know which of the ladies is Anni-Frid Lyngstad and which is Agnetha Faltskog. Knock it down to $20 and we’ll talk.
Call of Duty: Roads to Victory,PSP,Mar-13-2007,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GamesRadar+,60,The game is still playable although not without its frustrations. And seriously why bother giving us an accuracy percentage when aiming is nearly impossible. Thats like yelling at an arthritic waiter for spilling your soup. But the wonderful presentation COD fans have come to expect is intact and the game visually translates unimpeded.
Wheelman,Xbox 360,Mar-24-2009,Tigon | Midway Studios - Newcastle,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Gamer.nl,60,Wheelman is best described as a B-movie. Bad production values and a lousy script. However the funny one-liners bad dialog and over-the-top action make up for lost ground. Wheelman is by far a good game but still a very enjoyable one.
Wavey The Rocket,PC,May-7-2020,UpperRoom Games Ltd,Action | General,DarkZero,60,When it’s all said and done my main quarrel with all of these issues is that they are holding this super concept back from reaching anywhere near its potential and it’s just such a shame to see. Wavey The Rocket has its ups and downs it’s crests and troughs if you will but it is still a good game at its core. There are just a few rough edges that need to be worked on and status quos to break free of. Instead of trying to fit this new idea into an established space like a wavey peg into a conventionally-shaped hole I wanted to see it go further to think bigger!
Danger Zone,PlayStation 4,May-30-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,IGN Spain,60,Short not very beautiful and with a lot of room to improve but still fun while we wait for a new Burnout game.
Redeemer,PC,Aug-1-2017,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,GameOver.gr,60,It’s a pure beat ‘em up game with satisfying and fast combat albeit without any effort to provide anything we haven’t seen before. Its repetitive nature goes without saying raising the guilt part of this guilty pleasure offering exponentially with each passing hour.
STRAFE,PC,May-9-2017,Pixel Titans,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Gameplanet,60,Strafe isnt bad but there are many better ways to satiate your nostalgia for 90s FPS titles.
Townsmen: A Kingdom Rebuilt,Switch,Nov-9-2018,HandyGames,Strategy | General | Management | Government,Nintenderos,52,Townsmen allows us to manage our village not only against the invading forces but also against the different natural forces such as storms or snow avalanches. Despite this the title is somewhat monotonous and has boring loading screens.
The Town of Light,PC,Feb-26-2016,LKA,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Edge Magazine,60,For all its faults theres every chance The Town of Light could end up getting under your[ skin]. [April 2016 p.112]
X-Men: The Arcade Game,PlayStation 3,Dec-14-2010,Konami,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Age,67,So yeah X-Men is a game with limited appeal to very particular niche but its something Im personally extremely happy to have and its nearly identical to what I played in the Arcade.
Van Helsing,PlayStation 2,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Stuff,60,The convoluted control scheme outlined in the manual leads you believe you can pull of coolly calculated combinations (isnt alliteration fun!) but the action quickly devolves into button-mashing confusion.
Mace Griffin Bounty Hunter,Xbox,Jun-20-2003,Warthog,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,netjak,60,Isnt the greatest game ever made but it certainly isnt the worst. I personally had a very good time with it and recommend it to anyone looking for a good solid singleplayer FPS fix.
Global Touring Challenge: Africa,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2002,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Play Magazine,60,All the basics are in place competently attended to and the visual presence is extremely strong – little details like an amazing waterfall and dense environment effects continually impress. [June 2002 p.55]
WWE WrestleMania X8,GameCube,Jun-9-2002,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Into Liquid Sky,58,Single player matches can be fun except when getting into multi-opponent matches where the computer decides that youre always the odd-man out. Youll be screaming for blood when its you versus three opponents.
Forever Kingdom,PlayStation 2,Jan-21-2002,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameSpot,63,A game with no real outstanding qualities. That said if the core gameplay is enough to hold your interest and if you enjoy collecting rare items the game may be worth a purchase.
Floigan Bros. Episode 1,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2001,Visual Concepts,Action | General,Hot Games,60,Impressive for its visual and audio style these Brothers need more help in the gameplay department if they hope to become a franchise.
Gradius III and IV,PlayStation 2,Nov-13-2000,KCET,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,GameSpot,63,Konamis sights may be locked dead on the retrogaming audience but Gradius III & IV are both excellent albeit incredibly difficult games in their own right.
We Happy Few,Xbox One,Aug-10-2018,Compulsion Games,Action Adventure | General,TrueAchievements,60,If We Happy Few had all of these problems while in Xbox Game Preview and a pre-release state youd be more likely to excuse it but its rare to encounter so many issues in a full game release. While none were game breaking they spoil what can be a decent game with a unique world interesting characters and a convincingly damning depiction of the perils of taking hallucinogenic drugs. Its a world to which you want to return but its also a world that throws up a new problem with every visit. With several patches this game could be a fun experience but right now it can often be an exercise in frustration.
Micro Machines V4,PlayStation 2,Jun-27-2006,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Games Master UK,65,Tiny-car heaven cant make up for a game that feels a bit wimpy next to bigger racers. [Aug 2006 p.79]
Legend of Kay Anniversary,PC,Jul-27-2015,Neon Studios | Kaiko,Action Adventure | General | Linear,Ragequit.gr,65,Legend of Kay Anniversary is a genuinely fun action platformer that is let down by its outdated visuals annoying camera and clunky control system. There are hours of fun to be had here but make sure you have a decent gamepad and you adjust your expectations accordingly. It is after all still a 2005 game at heart.
Major League Baseball 2K9,Xbox 360,Mar-3-2009,2K Sports,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Official Xbox Magazine,65,The laundry list of annoying little problems is too substantial. [Apr 2009 p.76]
Party Hard,PC,Aug-25-2015,Pinokl Games,Action | General,games(TM),60,When you’ve wasted 15 minutes watching two pixel people chat each other up but never move to the bedroom to seal the deal; it’s these scenarios where getting caught by the cops or feds becomes a frustration instead of a punishment. It’s almost like some people don’t want to get murdered. Rude.
BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II,3DS,May-31-2011,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Everyeye.it,60,BlazBlue Continuum Shift II shines in its gameplay but fails in every other aspect due to the many flaws of a lazy porting.
Disgaea Infinite,PSP,Jun-8-2010,Nippon Ichi Software,Adventure | General | General | Visual Novel,Digital Chumps,60,A visual novel on mobile platform seems like a match made in heaven but Disgaea Infinites cumbersome interface and reliance on repetition render it more flawed that fascinating.
RiME,Switch,Nov-14-2017,Tantalus | Tequila Works,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,Vooks,60,Overall RiME is a delicately-constructed experience sprinkled with beautiful moments on the proviso you play the game exclusively docked to the TV. However you should consider playing RiME on another platform to avoid the myriad technical and visual issues that come with the Switch port.
Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix,Switch,Nov-8-2018,RideonJapan |Inc.,Action | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,Switch Player,60,Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix is a fun tactical game that is ultimately let down by its stereotypical plain characters and a dull storyline. Fans who appreciate strategy should give it a try but shouldn’t get their hopes up for anything beyond the game being good.
Batman: The Telltale Series,PC,Aug-2-2016,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Riot Pixels,60,Its a game for Batman fans who really dont care about the form. Or for fans of Telltales products who arent picky about the content.
Alien Breed,PlayStation Vita,Feb-12-2013,Team17,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Digital Spy,60,The enhanced visuals and local and online co-operative multiplayer are welcome additions but everything else feels a little bit outdated with a distinct lack of variety in enemies and objectives in particular making the levels bland and monotonous by todays standards.
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight,PC,Mar-16-2010,EA LA,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Eurogamer,60,Its nothing at all like Command & Conquer but - eventually - its a thoughtful and bombastic multiplayer RTS thats welcoming to everyone.
The Saga of Ryzom,PC,Sep-20-2004,Nevrax,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Games Radar,64,A slow starter. However its a huge world which is full of big ideas. Jump in now for a game that promises to be an interesting take on a staid genre - or hold fire a month or two to see how it lives up to its promises. [PC Gamer UK]
Mad Riders,Xbox 360,May-30-2012,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,GameWatcher,65,Mad Riders borrows a little too liberally from other titles to truly have its own identity. What is there however is an enjoyable enough arcade racer.
Need for Speed Undercover,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2008,EA Vancouver,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,3DJuegos,64,Need for Speed Undercover is one of the biggest bluffs of this final quarter of 2008. Far from catching the spirit of Most Wanted the game of Black Box fails in its proposal because of an excessively easy campaign and because of its shock-car style driving.
Warframe,PlayStation 4,Nov-12-2013,Digital Extremes,General | General | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,GameTrailers,60,With an asking price of nothing it’s not unreasonable that Warframe charges for things but when the game’s main hook is getting more loot it slowly becomes frustrating running into so many roadblocks. Even with your warframe’s athletic prowess the nondescript missions don’t offer enough to put up with the waiting and there certainly isn’t a strong reason to part with a credit card.
Ghostbusters: The Video Game,PlayStation 2,Jun-16-2009,War Drum Studios,Action | General,GamesRadar+,60,Ultimately this game is a true celebration of all things Ghostbusters and fans shouldnt wait to get this if the PlayStation 2 is all they have. For those with little love for the series its still a good action game even if the no-frills levels and abbreviated campaign are bound to leave you feeling like youre sitting at the kids table while the adults feast.
Phantasy Star Universe,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2006,Sonic Team,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameDaily,60,On paper expanding upon each aspect of the well-received Phantasy Star Online appears attractive yet a shoddy execution lacks the finely-tuned balance the game was known for.
Armored Core: For Answer,Xbox 360,Sep-16-2008,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Game Informer,63,Basically play it for the multiplayer or don’t play it at all.
The friends of Ringo Ishikawa,Switch,Apr-3-2019,yeo,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Pure Nintendo,50,While the concept of an open world beat ‘em up set in high-school sounds interesting the way it was executed is far from perfect. Furthermore the entire world feels meaningless as there is no way to easily tell what time your classes begin and where they are. It is also difficult to know where each building is in the world because The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa lacks a map/compass feature. If you are looking for a unique beat ‘em up and are willing to manage it’s user experience issues then this is a perfect game for you.
Seasons After Fall,PlayStation 4,May-16-2017,Swing Swing Submarine,Action | Platformer | 2D,Video Chums,65,Seasons After Fall is a beautiful game to look at and listen to but it can often be tedious to play due to its insistence on repeated backtracking and general lack of guidance. There are some endearing moments throughout its confusing story but the amount of running back and forth between them makes it questionable whether theyre worth the effort of uncovering.
The Baconing,Xbox 360,Aug-31-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Action RPG | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine UK,60,Itd make a great TV show though. [Nov 2011 p.107]
Vikings: Wolves of Midgard,Xbox One,Mar-28-2017,Games Farm,Role-Playing | Action RPG,SpazioGames,60,Vikings Wolves of Midgard is a passable Diablo clone full of fresh ideas for the genre none of which really fits into the gameplay let down by repetition and peculiar game design choices. There are far better similar games on Xbox One and its very hard to recommend this one over Diablo III Bastion or Hyper Light Drifter.
NASCAR: The Game 2013,PC,Jul-24-2013,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,Hooked Gamers,65,If you are a casual racing fan or someone who has not played a racing simulation with any regularity NASCAR 2013 is not the game for you. The lack of a comprehensive tutorial pretty much prevents you from gaining any sort of entertainment out of it past the first hour or two. But if you are a fan of NASCAR and its simulations or if you have plenty of experience with racing simulations I think you will be able to look past the obstacles and find a relatively enjoyable game within.
N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure,Xbox One,May-15-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Miscellaneous | Adventure | Puzzle | General | 3D | First-Person,Vandal,60,Nero is an interesting adventure but it has very important technical issues that make it feel worse than it is at its core.
Sea of Solitude,PC,Jul-5-2019,Electronic Arts | Jo-Mei Games,General | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,PC Gamer,64,Sea of Solitude is a gorgeous adventure that knows its way around mental illness but doesnt make great use of the medium to tell its story.
Kholat,PlayStation 4,Mar-8-2016,IMGN.PRO,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,XGN,65,Kholat could have been an amazing game but it just isnt. Its based on a true story and looks great. The game start really good but then slips away in boredom. The tension it needs just fades away really quickly.
The Crew,Xbox One,Dec-2-2014,Ubisoft Reflections | Ivory Tower,GT / Street | Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | Automobile,COGconnected,60,It pains me to say it seeing as I had such high hopes but The Crew missed its mark by a long shot and just barely chugs over the starting line.
Tiger Woods PGA Tour,DS,Dec-14-2004,Sensory Sweep,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Sim | Sim,GameZone,68,Some people will absolutely love what this game has to offer but for the most part I think gamers will be more frustrated then thrilled.
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,PSM Magazine,60,Theres nothing wrong with early retirement....youve earned it Spyro. [Dec. 2006 p.82]
Academy of Champions: Soccer,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,Nintendo Power,65,Obviously Academy of Champions: Soccer is not a game for hardcore footie fans but those looking for a pick-up-and-play soccer game should give it a try. [Dec 2009 p.86]
Moons of Madness,Xbox One,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,SomosXbox,59,Moons of Madness is a game of light and shadow. Its setting is superb but it drowns in an excessively cryptic story and in a boring gameplay.
Sleep Tight,Switch,Jul-26-2018,We Are Fuzzy,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Worth Playing,60,In the end Sleep Tight means well but is very limited in scope. The core mechanics are fine and the different upgrade trees are good but the slow difficulty ramping can make it feel like a grind in a short amount of time. The lack of any modes hurts significantly as does the lack of variety in locations and your arsenal. Unless you want something simple in your tower defense or twin-stick shooting game its easy to pass on Sleep Tight in favor of other titles.
Disney/Pixar Ratatouille,PSP,Jun-26-2007,Locomotive Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameZone,62,The PSP version of Ratatouille hardly feels like much of a morsel and compared to the far superior console version this will be a disappointment for anyone who fell in love with the movie.
Batman Begins,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2005,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Edge Magazine,60,Where the game really succeeds however beyond providing a robust and solid if unassuming model of explorative stealth and attack is in fulfilling that old and oft-forgotten criterion - putting the gamer inside the movie. [Aug 2005 p.95]
Carve,Xbox,Feb-24-2004,Argonaut Games,Driving | Racing | Snow / Water,games(TM),60,Youll get most out of the game on Xbox Live. Working alone or with friends Carves online races are unique as the properties of water allow for some novel gameplay. By crossing in front of rivals you can create waves that make life more difficult for them - something that works particularly well when working as part of a team. [Feb 2004 p.120]
Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction,Xbox,Jul-30-2003,Zono Inc.,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi,Village Voice,60,Or better yet take advantage of the games slightly flawed design and go Predator slaughtering the weaker species.
X-Squad,PlayStation 2,Oct-23-2000,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,PSX Nation,50,Rent it beat it forget it ever existed and start drooling over the upcoming Winback remake.
Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault,PlayStation 3,Nov-27-2012,Insomniac Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameOver.gr,60,QForce is quite enjoyable and with the budget price it comes with can certainly be recommended to fans of the franchise. But its not a proper R&C game and certainly not the ideal way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Insomniacs beloved duo.
Yakuza: Dead Souls,PlayStation 3,Mar-13-2012,Ryu ga Gotoku Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Gamer.nl,60,A zombie-outbreak in the Yakuza makes for a fresh change of pace. Unfortunately that really says it all because Dead Souls misses the nuance and class of previous installments. Its not even the presentation or story but mostly the game mechanics that disappoint. Shooting zombies is what youll be doing most in Dead souls and by the end of the game youll long for the regular Yakuza experience.
ADR1FT,PC,Mar-28-2016,Three One Zero,Action | Action Adventure | General | Survival,games(TM),60,A game that succeeds in being like no other but falls short of realising its potential.
Chaos Wars,PlayStation 2,May-30-2008,Idea Factory,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Gaming Age,58,If youre a big fan of these niche style games then it should be right up your alley. Nothing else about Chaos Wars really stands out the graphics are 2D on a 3D plane and look well enough but the music isnt really exceptional stuff.
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III,PC,May-22-2015,NeocoreGames,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameWatcher,60,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 3 is a good-looking game but the lack of features from the previous entries are a sore point
Super Lucky's Tale,Xbox One,Nov-7-2017,Playful Corp.,2D | Action | Platformer | 3D,New Game Network,65,Super Luckys Tale looks and sounds pleasant and its charming world and characters will appeal to younger audiences. However despite getting the basics right some gameplay and overall design concerns lead the game down a few wrong foxholes.
Cold War,PC,Sep-27-2005,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Chronicles,65,Its gameplay and graphics are good but it does not stand out in any major way.
Snooker 19,Switch,Aug-23-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Digitally Downloaded,60,For the very small niche of people who care that much about Snooker however Snooker 19 does deliver. There are more accessible Pool titles out there - including on the Nintendo Switch itself but as an attempt to go the full distance with a deeply authentic simulation Snooker 19 is a good and genuine effort.
Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs. Sasuke,DS,Nov-12-2010,Takara Tomy,Action | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Worth Playing,65,Fans will definitely get some enjoyment out of this title but its going to fall a little flat for everyone else.
Officers,PC,Jul-14-2009,3A Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,DarkZero,60,This is one of the worst types of tragedies that can befall a game – to be brimming with potential and fun gameplay only to get ruined with technical blunders.
Zombie Driver HD,Xbox 360,Oct-17-2012,EXOR Studios,Action | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,Its straightforward meaty gameplay but the lack of multiplayer feels a little brain-dead. [Issue#92 p.87]
Crash Twinsanity,PlayStation 2,Sep-28-2004,Traveller's Tales,Action | Platformer | 3D,PSM Magazine,60,Though the game looks and controls well levels appear to be designed to kill the player in as many cheap ways as possible. [Dec 2004 p.78]
MX vs. ATV All Out: Anniversary Edition,Xbox One,Feb-26-2019,THQ Nordic,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,XboxAddict,60,For someone that wants to experience the chaos of MX bikes racing alongside ATV’s and even UTV’s MX vs ATV All Out Anniversary Edition will scratch that itch. It’s a shame that not all of the DLC is included in this version but the ones that are will add a decent chunk of gameplay to keep you busy for a few extra hours. While nowhere near a perfect experience it can be fun in short doses and allows an accessibility for newcomers to the series and genre to enjoy while having a decent amount of depth and replayability for veterans.
Darksiders III,PlayStation 4,Nov-27-2018,Gunfire Games | THQ Nordic,Action Adventure | Open-World,New Game Network,60,Severe performance problems and a misguided implementation of Souls mechanics in Darksiders 3 tarnish an otherwise perfunctory but at least occasionally enjoyable return to one of last generations better action series.
RymdResa,PC,Aug-20-2015,Morgondag,Role-Playing | General,Brash Games,60,Despite its flaws RymdResa offers a mostly relaxing experience and is something a little different from the norm.
Hydrophobia: Prophecy,PC,May-9-2011,Dark Energy Digital,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Third times the Charm – first time it was XBLA Hydrophobia then the game was released again as Pure and now weve got Prophecy. Enough tries we say. [July 2011]
Intellivision Lives!,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2003,Realtime Associates,Miscellaneous | Compilation,IGN,60,The amount of games and the retrospective elements: good. The horrible controls: extremely bad.
Worms: Open Warfare,DS,Mar-22-2006,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Artillery,IGN,60,The PSP group - internal Team 17 developers - clearly had a lot more interest and fun working on its rendition of Worms because this DS game while holding some of the originals charm looks like it was handled by a weekend port crew.
Storm,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,EKO Software,Miscellaneous | General | General,Eurogamer Sweden,60,Storm offers a charming puzzle experience but it relies too much on agility and timing and too little on well crafted levels.
TNA iMPACT!,PlayStation 3,Sep-9-2008,Midway Studios - Los Angeles,Action | Sports | Fighting | Fighting | Individual | Wrestling | Combat | Wrestling,IGN,64,TNA iMPACT! had a lot of potential but it didnt follow through on most of it. Beyond the limited/repetitive moves lackluster CAW and scaled back online my main problem is that iMPACT! doesnt feel like real wrestling.
RPG Maker Fes,3DS,Jun-27-2017,Jupiter Corporation | Kadokawa,Role-Playing | General,God is a Geek,60,RPG Maker FES really wants you to make the games you want but doesn’t want to help you out in any way.
nail'd,Xbox 360,Nov-30-2010,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Gamereactor Denmark,60,A blistering fast and high flying off-road racer with no intentions of anything resembling realism. But while it can be fun for a quick romp it lacks in both the variety and challenge departments. Too shallow to entertain for more than a few hours.
Killer Is Dead,PlayStation 3,Aug-27-2013,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),60,Stylish and most of the time entertaining as well this carnage from the mind of a well known weirdo designer Suda 51 doesnt bring anything new to the table except for its bizarre aesthetics that may or may not suit you. [Issue#234]
Arc Rise Fantasia,Wii,Jul-27-2010,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GamePro,60,If the only system you have is a Wii and you need an RPG this certainly isnt a bad title to settle for. For gamers with more console options however the enjoyment youll derive from Arc Rise Fantasia will likely be tied to how much you like combat since the story certainly isnt anything worthwhile.
Exit DS,DS,Nov-5-2008,Moss,Action | Puzzle | General | General,GamesRadar+,60,Your characters will not do what you want them to a decent portion of the time.
Track Lab,PlayStation 4,Aug-21-2018,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,Worth Playing,55,Track Lab is an interesting title. If youre looking at it as a game it has some great puzzle mechanics but theres only enough content to last you about an hour unless you get stuck on one of the puzzles. If youre looking at it as a music creation tool the interface is novel but not something youll use to seriously create tunes especially since theres no easy way to export your creations. Ultimately Track Lab is more of a fun toy in VR but not something youll be itching to visit more than a few times.
Rainbow Skies,PlayStation 4,Jun-26-2018,SideQuest Studios,Role-Playing | General,God is a Geek,55,A disappointing sequel that fails to recapture the magic of its predecessor.
King Oddball,Xbox One,Sep-9-2016,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Action,COGconnected,60,Although King Oddball is repetitive and becomes frustrating with poor level design and the reliance on luck over strategy there are a few redeeming factors including additional game modes that actually make the game a decent value for the price. For less than $5 you can play an indie version of Angry Birds with controls that are even more simple.
Thor: God of Thunder,DS,May-3-2011,WayForward,Action | General | General,Metro GameCentral,60,Gorgeous 2D art still cant forgive the needless repetition but while the novelty lasts this is a great little brain dead brawler.
Cranium Kabookii,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,NintendoWorldReport,60,Cranium Kabookii is fun for a time but only if youve got a large group of people or big family to play it with. That makes it a good rental game but not much else.
Star Trek: Tactical Assault,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,62,A one-trick pony that boils down to the same basic maneuvers and slow-paced combat. It also horribly overlooks its license. Youll deal with Klingons and Romulans but the dull story and unrecognizable characters could have been used in any generic intergalactic setting.
Avatar: The Last Airbender,DS,Oct-10-2006,TOSE,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,AceGamez,60,I am left in a bit of a conundrum - here is a game where I barely passed the first boss battle and neither of my kids were able to defeat that first boss (my older son would have managed eventually it but after about twenty minutes he wanted to get back to Pokémon Ranger and didnt care if he ever saw Avatar again!)
Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue,GameCube,Aug-16-2005,Xpec,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,60,Its actually fun for someone who A.) Loves Hello Kitty B.) Hates alien invaders and C.) Loves to kill aliens while on roller skates.
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,PC,Nov-10-2004,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Cheat Code Central,60,Overall the gameplay is far too simple for any casual gamer but its sure to keep kids entertained even if they havent seen the movie or read any of the novels.
Wrath Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Feb-10-2004,Double Helix Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Gamer's Pulse,54,Its aspects of action while moderately engaging are wholly unbalanced; in addition the elements of strategy are watered-down for ease of play.
RoadKill,GameCube,Oct-30-2003,Terminal Reality,Driving | Car Combat,Electronic Gaming Monthly,62,As a car-combat game its passable but not exceptional. As a postacopalyptic GTA clone it falls well short of the mark in terms of story mission diversity and replay value. [Nov 2003 p.171]
Pro Rally,GameCube,Nov-11-2002,Ubisoft,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,GamerWeb Nintendo,65,Its a little schizo trying to tread the line between arcade racer and sim but its much more of an arcade style experience on the whole.
Superman: Shadow of Apokolips,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2002,Atari,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GamePro,60,It’s disappointing when a game finally nails the hard parts of reproducing Superman (the powers) but blows it with ho-hum missions and repetitive gameplay.
Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates,Game Boy Advance,Apr-30-2002,RFX Interactive,Action | Platformer | 2D,Game Informer,60,Beautiful background details dull play. [July 2002 p.87]
Wild Wild Racing,PlayStation 2,Oct-25-2000,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Happy Puppy,60,While the graphics and the sound are on point the game as a whole is weak.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood,PlayStation 4,Jul-26-2019,MachineGames,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Wccftech,60,Wolfenstein: Youngblood just never finds the right groove. The game’s needless RPG elements microtransactions and sloppy non-linear structure are obvious mistakes but it also has some surprising basic level design and pacing problems. Wolfenstein: Youngblood can still be good visceral fun in fits and starts but overall the game lacks the maturity of the elder Blazkowicz’ adventures.
Juiced,PC,Jun-13-2005,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Pelaaja (Finland),60,Juiced has many interesting features but they all have been seen before in the games it shamelessly imitates. The game has interesting characters and good career-mode but why bother when there are better games to choose from? [June 2005 p.62]
The Adventures of Tintin: The Game,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2011,Ubisoft Montpellier,Adventure | General | General,GamesRadar+,60,Even though it has its flaws The Adventures of Tintin never veers from decent to awful and Ubisoft Montpelier deserves credit for creating a rare wonder - a movie-spinoff that doesnt completely suck.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,PC,Jun-25-2007,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer,59,Die-hard Potter fans will thrill throughout to checking Hogwarts huge and detailed environs but Order of the Phoenixs repetitive gameplay will make many wish someone would cast an Avada Kedavara spell in their direction and put them out of their misery already. [Oct 2007 p.66]
Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2011,Vicious Cycle,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,60,Im honestly astounded as to how any game can be so good and so bad at the same time.
Dead Island: Definitive Collection,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,Techland,Miscellaneous | Compilation,PlayStation Universe,60,A reasonably-priced pair of remasters that actually do improve upon the original games plus you get a surprisingly decent bonus title in the mix too. Sadly while technical hiccups are stifled in the main games many of the mechanical flaws remain with the passage of time not helping matters. This means Dead Island is better than its ever been but a lot harder to enjoy than it once was.
The Witch and the Hundred Knight: Revival Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Worth Playing,60,If you dont mind the quirks and rough attempts at humor then you may enjoy The Witch and the Hundred Knight.
198X,PC,Jun-20-2019,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,AusGamers,64,The simplicity of 198X is endearing and how it presents a compilation of sorts of an era is something that leaves a positive if not lasting impression. The story although simple in its presentation does leave room for growth. We’re keen to check out the second part of the tale and if the team Hi-Bit Studios can connect both the narrative and the individual games in a more meaningful way - then it has every chance to live up to its premise.
The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer,Xbox,Nov-1-2005,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN,60,Its a short simple ride. The Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer offers decent fun for younger kids but the action and puzzles wont challenge older gamers.
Suikoden IV,PlayStation 2,Jan-11-2005,KCET,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Electronic Gaming Monthly,60,Relocating Suidodens established gameplay to the vast and choppy seas doesnt do it any favors - instead of exploring diverse geography on foot youre steering a boat across a bleak boring ocean. [Feb 2005 p.108]
Supreme Ruler: Cold War,PC,Jul-19-2011,BattleGoat Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,SpazioGames,60,A deep and profound strategic title wich fails to deliver mainly due to a lame user interface lack of tutorial questionable AI bad graphics and boring moments. The multiplayer fails to save it. Its definitely better to look elsewhere into the Paradox portfolio with better more refined titles as Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis.
This Is the Police,PlayStation 4,Mar-22-2017,Weappy Studio,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life | Career,Playstation Official Magazine UK,60,A game as flawed as its protagonist. [May 2017 p.96]
Neon Chrome,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,DarkStation,60,All in all I enjoyed my time with Neon Chrome. It delivers the basics of why I like twin-stick shooters and adds its own mark with an emphasis on strategy and a cool cyberpunk theme. Granted the game has a few shortcomings such as a non-existent story and sub-par graphics as well as being rather short and having no online co-op but if youre looking for something easy to pick up and play (especially with a friend) you could definitely do a lot worse!
FIFA Street 2,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,60,You might have some fun if all you care about is channeling your grade-school hacky-sack sessions but if youre looking to actually play street soccer youll wonder why your soccer pitch turned into a circus act. [Apr 2006 p.77]
Fallout 76: Wastelanders,PlayStation 4,Apr-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,GameCritics,65,Playing solo can still be entertaining but the moments of loneliness hang over the player like a cloud while they’re traveling from point A to point B. In the end it comes down to personal preference — some will enjoy the solemn journeys found in Appalachia while others will only play when friends are online but even without them the Wastelanders update is a step in the right direction.
Super Bomberman R,Xbox One,Jun-12-2018,Konami,Puzzle | Action | Arcade,SomosXbox,65,Super Bomberman R isnt the best game in the series but it offers a fun and entertaining challenge for all fans especially in its multiplayer mode.
Cubemen 2,Wii U,Sep-4-2014,3 Sprockets,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | General | Defense,Cubed3,60,Cubemen 2 is fun but its short-lived. The gameplay is relatively shallow (by necessity of the genre more than anything else) and theres little to do once the single-player campaigns are finished which doesnt take very long.
Necrovision,PC,May-18-2009,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PC Format,64,Were NecroVision to turn up on Steam for less than a tenner then itd be worth considering. [Apr 2009 p.99]
Worms Forts: Under Siege,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,games(TM),60,Forts Under Siege might have enough reward on offer but the series is still relying on gamers to meet it halfway by investing ample time and patience in learning its demanding intricacies. [Dec 2004 p.112]
Dirty Bomb,PC,Jun-1-2015,Splash Damage,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Digital Chumps,60,Dirty Bomb is a nice shooter that is a perfect F2P alternative to a lot of the major FPS titles out today. The game is still in beta however so there are a lot of features to be added and a lot of flaws to buff out. Hope that the devs can fix what needs to be fixed and polish this game to fulfill the potential it shows.
World Poker Tour,Xbox,Oct-18-2005,2K Sports,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,DarkStation,60,This budget game serves up some basic and ordinary poker action with decent Xbox Live support.
Moons of Madness,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,4Players.de,64,Visually impressive horror on Mars which takes inspiration from Lovecraft but unfortunately never manages to create panic for the player.
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,LucasArts,Action | General | General,Level7.nu,60,A major disappointment. We got a rush job with a game that is way too easy repetitive and frustrating at the same time. Star Wars fans might enjoy the act but wait until the price dropped.
Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom,Xbox One,Apr-28-2017,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object,TrueAchievements,60,After a great run of titles Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom doesnt quite match up to the standard of those that have gone before it.
Resident Evil 6,Xbox One,Mar-29-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,XBLA Fans,60,I dont think that there is really any new content here for fans who played the game comprehensively the first time around so it is those returning players who should consider their purchase most carefully.
Godzilla: Save the Earth,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Fighting | 3D,Xbox Nation Magazine,60,Its the brawling gameplay dragging things down. [Jan 2005 p.88]
FIFA Street 3,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,Good in the short term somewhat tedious in the long. [Issue#30 p.88]
Finding Nemo,Xbox,May-9-2003,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Xbox Nation Magazine,60,Surprisingly fun. [Aug 2003 p.87]
InnerSpace,Switch,Jan-16-2018,PolyKnight Games,Simulation | Flight | Civilian,Vooks,60,If you’re after game that’s unlike any others on the Switch and you’re after a flight game or just want to soak in the trippy visuals then InnerSpace has enough of both to enjoy. If you’re after a more traditional game then it becomes harder to recommend as all the ‘gamey’ elements are the most frustrating parts.
Dragon's Prophet,PC,Aug-13-2013,Runewaker Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy,JeuxActu,60,Seducing with its dragon theme free to play and quite well done as it even offers advanced housing Dragons Prophet is an MMORPG which does not look ridiculous. But we do have to admit that it lacks some punch to be able to compete against the genres stars because of poor polish an old graphics engine dull quests and a small amount of races and classes. We note that those drawbacks could be improved by an update overtime which allows us hope. But is trying Dragons Quest enough to get hooked? Not really but at least its free to try.
NBA 09 The Inside,PlayStation 3,Oct-7-2008,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,IGN,65,With a plethora of old bugs and issues rearing their head NBA 09: The Inside has a ton of problems that overwhelm the title. Its still a fun arcade-style basketball game but youre going to have to put up strange gameplay problems that have plagued the franchise for years and some unrealistic court play to fully enjoy it.
Shark Tale,PC,Sep-27-2004,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,IGN,65,It offers fun through various different game play styles and retains the hip style of the movie but the undercurrent of materialism is jarring.
X-Men: Next Dimension,GameCube,Oct-15-2002,Exakt,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,64,Even the most ardent X-Men fans should probably just rent Next Dimension rather than buy it.
Alpha Protocol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,Xbox World Australia,60,Alpha Protocol does many things right and succeeds where it count for an RPG but falls short elsewhere.
Spectrobes,DS,Mar-6-2007,Jupiter Corporation,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameSpot,60,As a scavenger sim Spectrobes absolutely succeeds but scouring every inch of planet after digital planet will quickly wear thin for most people.
PixelJunk 4am,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Q-Games,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Music Maker | Music Maker | Application,Eurogamer,60,4am is too obfuscated for serious music producers who will grow frustrated at the limited number of samples and the lack of visual feedback over which tracks and effects are active at any one time. And the experience is also too inscrutable for beginners who will find themselves lost in the matrix of noise unsure of how it may be truly directed or tamed. A fascinating toy then but a toy nonetheless.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India,PlayStation 4,Jan-13-2016,Ubisoft | Climax Studios,General | Action Adventure | Linear,Gameblog.fr,60,Assassins Creed Chronicles India offers a pleasant 2D stealth-action game but never manages to go much further.
Airheart: Tales of Broken Wings,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2018,Blindflug Studios,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,TheSixthAxis,60,Airheart presents an interesting idea with hints of brilliance but fails to deliver a game with staying power. Whilst the upgrade system is satisfying it’s let down by repetitive gameplay and UI issues that get in the way even when playing with the endearing crafting system.
DarkStar One: Broken Alliance,Xbox 360,Jul-13-2010,Gaming Minds Studios,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,Metro GameCentral,60,It might not be the Elite sequel of your dreams but this space trader is in a field of its own on 360.
Big Bumpin',Xbox 360,Nov-19-2006,Blitz Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Gaming Target,54,Based on price alone it wouldn’t be far fetched to assume that the game is a one-trick pony but surprisingly there is a nice handful of minigames to test out.
Citadel: Forged with Fire,Xbox One,Nov-1-2019,Blue Isle Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Windows Central,60,Citadel: Forged with Fire is a good game but needs more polish.
Dogos,Xbox One,Sep-7-2016,INTERNET URL S.A.,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,ZTGD,60,A solid game that overcomplicates its genre roots with its unique twist. Production values are solid but also bland when considering this is a game with little diversity in the game play.
NBA 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2007,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,PSM3 Magazine UK,61,EAs more excessible and exciting Live is the team that makes the playoffs this year. [Feb 2008 p.78]
Windlands,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,COGconnected,64,The best compliment I can give Windlands is that for other developers there is a lot that can be gleaned from this experience soaring through the skies and the game is worth checking out for that reason alone.
Major League Baseball 2K8,Wii,Mar-3-2008,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,IGN,65,The lack of online 2K card system and minor league teams is a huge letdown though especially when you consider the Wii Connect 24 integration that could have allowed for live stat streaming updated trades (Santana is still on the Twins for example. Why?) and competitive stat tracking.
The World Next Door,Switch,Mar-27-2019,Rose City Games,Action Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,60,The World Next Door is not a title that’s going to rock anyone’s world but it’s a good title that would be worth checking out for someone wanting something a little different. The puzzle combat system is enjoyable but could have benefited from further development to flesh it out a bit more. The story isn’t extraordinary but is still an enjoyable journey despite its anticlimatic ending. The game takes about four hours or so to complete so it isn’t a huge time commitment. The world of Emrys is an interestingly designed world that can be fun to visit but is also not a bucket list destination.
Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,PlayStation 4,Feb-24-2015,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,CGMagazine,65,Koei doesn’t seem very interested in appealing to new customers because DW8 Empires assumes that you’re thoroughly familiar with not just the DW franchise but the Empires spin-off.
The Immortals of Terra: A Perry Rhodan Adventure,PC,Jul-3-2008,Braingame,Adventure | 3D | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person,GameZone,59,Only the most die-hard fans of the Perry Rhodan series will truly love this game. Others looking for a well-thought out and engaging adventure may want to look elsewhere.
NBA Live 07,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2006,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Sim,GameZone,67,While NBA Live 07 is a generally decent sports game with near-average replayability it doesn’t capture anything. You’ll be amused but not engrossed. It’s an update to last year’s game not a sequel.
Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings,PSP,Jun-9-2009,Amaze Entertainment | Amaze,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,Eurogamer Portugal,60,The game doesn’t present anything new being essentially aimed at fans of the series that will be entertained while playing this new adventure of Dr. Henry Jones.
Eragon,DS,Nov-14-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Action RPG | General | Fantasy | Beat-'Em-Up | Japanese-Style | 3D,GameSpot,64,Eragon is short and the touch-screen controls dont work very well but its still a fairly decent action adventure game.
Sniper Elite III,Xbox One,Jul-1-2014,Rebellion,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic,X-ONE Magazine UK,60,If you live for the glory of the kill Sniper Elite III is the game for you just dont expect it to be routinely enjoyable.

Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines,PSP,Nov-17-2009,Griptonite Games,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,D+PAD Magazine,60,Despite some obvious talent on the part of Griptonite Games Assassin’s Creed: Bloodlines smacks a little too much of an unloved unwanted by-product birthed from the success of the franchise.
Penny-Punching Princess,Switch,Apr-3-2018,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Switch Player,60,Penny-Punching Princess brings an interesting slant to the brawler genre one that sadly can become fiddly and repetitive over time. As a fairly expensive eShop title (physical release plans were scrapped at the last minute) it’s difficult to recommend a purchase here given what you could get for your money instead. Penny-Punching Princess is certainly not a bad game but it’s not a great one either. One to look for in the sales then where your calculator allows.
Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche,Switch,Apr-1-2020,WayForward,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,FNintendo,60,Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche is an unusual game based on the formula of a shootem-up but with plenty of elements of other genres and which does several things right - its original ideas humor-filled dialogue and colourful outlook stand out as its main assets. On the other hand its very short lifespan high selling price and rather quick way with which it will feel like a done experience will not attract many players to this new arrival on the Nintendo Switch catalogue.
The Godfather II,PC,Apr-7-2009,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Adventure | Third-Person | Historic | Linear | Open-World | Modern,SpazioGames,65,All in all The Godfather II goes on the same path of its predecessor: funny gameplay but repetitive cool design but graphics look old. You can squeeze the best out of it while managing your rackets but the fun won’t last long and won’t leave much behind when it’s over.
Bounty Hounds,PSP,Sep-13-2006,Xpec,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Game Informer,63,In short theres fun to be had here if youre willing to put up with the stuff that sucks. [Nov. 2006 p.146]
Call of Juarez: The Cartel,PlayStation 3,Jul-19-2011,Techland,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gaming Age,42,The single best feature in Call of Juarez: The Cartel is the ability to play through the entire game in co-op.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,Boring and uninventive zombie smasher is as bad as it looks like. [Issue#208]
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Official Xbox Magazine,35,Even with the Quest Mode’s extra goals the game felt too simple for its own good. Extra value should’ve come from the online modes but horrific lag rendered them unplayable and there’s no offline multiplayer.
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Vandal,45,Infinity Runner tries to adapt a mobile concept to new platforms but it just doesnt work as it should. Its just a different take on a mobile game but if youre ok with that then itll satisfy you.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameSpot,40,The very definition of a stripped-down budget title as practically every aspect that would make a game fun or interesting is missing.
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Impulsegamer,36,I wanted to like this so badly and was truly excited for it. I hate to say this but it is a waste of your time and money. Give this one a miss.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,The A.V. Club,42,Most of the trucks ride like they should be carting oranges or vending-machine refills instead of chasing bandits. Pushing them down the road with a keyboard aint much fun—and driving eats up almost all of your playing time.
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,VGPub,36,A bottom of the barrel poker game. It does have some cool things that most other poker games don’t like craps and sports betting but the bad far outweighs the good. Avoid this one at all costs.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Random turn-based combat and impenetrable inventory. [Spring 2011 p.116]
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameOver.gr,40,It seems that after a continuous flow of releases Supermassive Games has run out of juice. Bravo Team is more or less a broken game an idea that really does not work on any degree and probably the worst 1st party game for the PSVR to date.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,God is a Geek,40,Rodea The Sky Soldier on 3DS has very few good things going for it overshadowed by atrocious controls and bland visuals. It is designed to be replayed but I don’t ever want to experience it again.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,GameSpy,40,The slow load times the tedious puzzles and the overall lack of fun in this title are almost awe inspiring. Its really very hard figure out why someone gave the go-ahead on its production.
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,Extreme Gamer,40,A flat out bomb just like the pictures ticket sales. Its a shame Electronic Arts had to develop a movie version of Catwoman without the freedom of using the real feline character from the comics. Stay away from this game.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN,40,Sloppily produced and bug-filled. Its still playable but its extremely difficult to overlook all the games problems...because theres just so many of them.
Shadow the Hedgehog,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2005,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,Game Informer,40,The new gun combat is horrid. [Jan 2006 p.138]

Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,AtomicGamer,51,Whether you pick this one up for the PC or for Xbox Live Arcade you can be assured that youre getting a mediocre game thats only loosely tied to the events of the show.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,games(TM),40,Somewhere buried within The Sky Soldier is the kernel of an idea that defies gravity as well as our expectations. Sadly despite Naka’s best intentions Rodea never hits those heights.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),40,Dumb fun boils over into awful stew when we as the Greek Achilles are forced to stab toes during a two-part and cliche-addled boss fight against a giant statue complete with respawning zombie minions quick-time events and enough hamartia to choke mighty Zeus himself. [June 2011 p.75]
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Computer and Video Games,40,The faster the car the more jelly-like things seem to become. The gorgeous Ford GT 2005 handles like the entire world was one big bouncy castle as it bobs and lurches around like it had helium-filled wheels. [Official UK Xbox Magazine]
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Xbox Achievements,42,Darkest of Days takes the concept of time travel in an interesting direction and then proceeds to fumble at every turn. Poor AI and slowdown lead the list of this games problems and with so many better shooters out there this isnt worth the time and frustration.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,3DJuegos,40,The Scourge Project it´s just an unpolished third person shooter utilizing the Unreal Engine and featuring four Gears of War wannabes as its main characters. Uninspired gameplay constant issues and boring story this game is one to avoid.
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,Absolute Games,35,Sword of the Stars 2 is what happens when a space opera becomes a hostage of amateurish idealists.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,40,Theres very little to redeem a generally poor effort to create a tycoon game for the DS that has any personality or creates any real fun for the player.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Absolute Games,35,It’s hard to see why they ask money for this one. If you want to swing a baseball bat as Rorschach save yourself $15 and just buy Part I.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,3DJuegos,40,A disappointing experience. Confounds the simple things with the annoying mechanics. Far away from the great games of the turtles and the excellence of the Japanese developers. Platinum Games are human too.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,40,Nothing more than a stagnant relentlessly boring game. You can exploit everything the game has to offer in less than a couple of hours.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamePro,40,No matter how many bonuses are unlocked or how many special guests show up the core gameplay of Superman: The Man of Steel is boring.
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,PSX Nation,40,Once you go it alone it becomes increasingly clear that your teammate AI is straight out pathetic.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Everyeye.it,45,No difference between part 2 and part 1: boring dull and short.
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,IGN,40,Hardcore Hummer fans or owners will like seeing taking control of their favorite rides. Racing fans however will not enjoy the weak competition shallow game modes and lackluster graphics and sound.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,DarkStation,40,The gameplay just seemed so bland and boring that I really dont think I ever enjoyed this game.
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,DarkZero,40,It’s quite hard to recommend Last Rebellion to anyone but some insane hardcore RPG person certainly after the recent rush of decent titles that have arrived for the genre. The game is full of so many decisions that hamper the experience and fun.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,40,Its not just the ball that will be rolling when youre playing Chronovolt your eyes will be clocking in overtime too. It might be free if youre subscribed to PlayStation Plus but you wont be doing yourself any favours by downloading it. Its boring. Its got a ton of bugs. It sucks balls. [January 2013 p.94]
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameCritics,40,I still count myself as a huge fan of Dead Island but Ryder White takes too many wrong turns and strays from what made the original game what it was. Completists will surely want to see the twist ending but more casual fans of the game dont have much reason to take this brutal frustrating trip.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Core Magazine,42,Its always interesting to have the option of being the bad guy but truly bland gameplay and a relatively short quest sap the fun and make this a rental at best.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpy,40,Even at $29.99 and with an arcade mode that might keep you amused for five or ten minutes State of Emergency 2 feels simultaneously stale and awkward. It isnt complete trash but it is too aggravating and unimaginative to be worth more than a Friday night rental.
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,FNintendo,40,AeternoBlade II for the Nintendo Switch has some good ideas and its RPG-like elements do give the game some appeal. That said the execution is rather poor and its combat quickly becomes frustrating. Adding to that its mediocre art style technical issues and exceedingly long loading times make this a rather botched experience that becomes difficult to recommend.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,The Indie Game Website,40,The story itself is told through comic book panels that do inject a bit of colour and personality into the game but it’s not enough. This is soulless empty and unpolished – a total whiteout. In old Norse ‘fimbul’ translates as mighty or great. But this particular Fimbul is anything but.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,VideoGamer,40,Golden Axe is the latest classic franchise to disappoint on new hardware and we cant help but think its a huge wasted opportunity. Beast Rider even fails to include multiplayer support something that was core to the original game confirming its fate as a sub-par hack n slash.
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Cheat Code Central,38,Although there are plenty of modes the poor controls hamper any play value this title might have had.
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,Too many games that involve no skill. [Aug 2007 p.98]
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,The Overpowered Noobs,40,With Sonic and Mario in the spotlight again Bubsy takes another swipe at being a lovable mascot but doesn’t succeed in capturing the same sentiment. Ultimately Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back (Bubsy) the platforming game arrives as the two-decades-too-late 5th entry in the series. Despite excellent controls the title does not overcome some of its more pressing shortcomings such as level design resulting in a sub-par gaming experience.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamer.nl,40,Offers little variation and hardly requires strategic input which leaves a mindless third-person shooter. The well-executed story and great looking characters make it a tad more interesting but these elements cant hide the fact that the four-eyed magician often turns to his wands for simple and selfish needs.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,IGN,40,You should probably avoid Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey even if youre obsessed with pirates -- its just not a well-made game.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,GamesRadar+,40,An interesting blast from the past but much like the visuals of the original film it really doesn’t hold up over time.
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,1UP,40,As a budget release Renegade Paintball is a bit more robust than you would imagine but the buggy gameplay along with several more oddities will be quick to remind you that yes this is yet another half-baked budgetware title to forget about.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Edge Magazine,40,For all its wit and swagger Truckers is inescapably safety-conscious rewarding the maintenance of a planned route and steady trajectory while more arresting notions - spontaneous risk for example - fall from the back like poorly fastened cases of moonshine. [Sept 2005 p.99]
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GameSpot,40,Warriors Orochi 2 elevates hack-and-slash action to amazing levels of repetitive boredom.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,Play.tm,40,A cheap shoddy cash in.
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,G4 TV,40,Only those gamers in it for the puzzles will get a kick out of this one--those who don’t get overwhelmed that is.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GameOver.gr,40,Rise of the Dark Spark is the definition of a movie tie-in. It contains all the ingredients of uninspired levels nonsensical story and dull repetitive gameplay.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,40,The Tetris we all know and love never got boring. This does. [June 2002 p.100]
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,Happy Puppy,45,More of a rental than a purchase unless youre a huge football fanatic who requires every pigskin video game.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,PSNStores,40,It sucks to say it but the frustrating controls flat out ruin any enjoyment I had with Q*Bert Rebooted. The path that you take throughout each stage is so important to Q*Bert and having controls that don’t cooperate in that respect really sucks.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,A large open world and plenty of options cant make up for trainwreck technology bad writing and clumsy combat. [Oct 2014 p.93]
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Boomtown,40,The breaking of the missions into arbitrary short sections doesnt work for me as I would prefer to see a large mission with sub-goals rather than what feels like lots of really short missions.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,IGN,40,While there is some fun to be had at the most simplistic of levels no effort was put into making this a stand-alone great DS title.
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Multiplayer.it,40,Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D looks like a rushed product which does not even tale advantage of features such as the touch screen. The idea of a war between dinosaurs is neat but the developer had to work harder on the overall gameplay.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,Hardcore Gamer,40,Despite its ambitious stride to tell a gripping tale of a father/husband striving desperately to look for his missing family Husk‘s end delivery is anything but. With a host of mechanical and structural oddities breaking numerous points of immersion where it’s seldom gained — both before and after post-release updates — across environments that though blended rather well into one another could very well be found in ample other titles using horror as an attribute Husk is a frustrating game to recommend. Marred by technical difficulties that come to question just how finished this game truly is/was Husk is another example of a studio that have mistaken basic nostalgia for the wealth of enjoyment.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),50,Paradises bag of tricks is sadly limited leaving only a violent juvenile romp were reluctant to recommend. [Holiday 2012 p.73]
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,Nintendo Life,40,Its entirely possible that one day UFO Interactive will crack the code of a genuinely interesting game but with a sense of humor about as basic as its mechanics - which is to say incredibly so - Johnny Kung Fu still has a ways to go.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,IGN,45,This isn’t the game mah jong players were waiting for on XBLA but it works as advertised and will tide people over until something better comes along. The lack of avatar support is disappointing as is the poor presentation and sub-par tutorial. But the online works and that’s all many players will require.
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,With the hilarity of multiplayer locked until you finish the solo missions and a slightly too-high price this is one to miss. Shame. [July 2008 p.94]
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,Gamestyle,40,We long for a good Godzilla game but this isn’t it.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamesRadar+,40,Destined to line bargain bin bottoms. It has its hacking and slashing moments but like so many movie-licensed titles it reeks of a truncated production schedule and a too-heavy reliance on a story intended for another medium.
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,Game Chronicles,35,Boring difficult (due to poor design) and repetitive.
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,IGN,30,I didnt like this game a bit. Its badly designed weak on tricks obvious slow and light years behind the best or even the most average extreme sports games.
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,GamesRadar+,40,It’s a sound idea that’s torpedoed by poor design and bad play mechanics.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,Laziness of the worst kind this is a charmless shadow of the next-gen version. There are plenty of better shooters available on PS2. [May 2006 p.82]
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,COGconnected,35,The big problem with Music VR is that the game just doesn’t have a lot of substance.
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gamers' Temple,41,There are just far too many better options out there when it comes to strategy games so why bother with a poorly designed one that is in the end an exercise in frustration?
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,NintendoWorldReport,40,There’s no reason to spend your pennies on CORE when several other far superior DS first-person shooters are sitting right next to it like Call of Duty 4 and Moon.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,Eurogamer,40,Later levels tend to get merely more irritating rather than more enjoyable and the many fans of the Oddworld series would have been better served with handheld versions of Abes Oddysee and Abes Exoddus rather than this frankly overpriced lame effort.
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,IGN,38,Too bad as is one of those lazy dragons needs to turn its fat ass around and blow some fire directly at the game from which it came as a little smoldering action is the only salvation I can fathom for this beast. Steer clear far clear.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PTGamers,40,In case you’re not interested in Tony Stark’s adventures there are much better games.
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,Computer and Video Games,43,The special attacks look crap and make no sense. How can you possibly electrocute a skeleton? Dry bone doesnt conduct. Someone wins. Youre bored. The end.
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Yahoo!,40,And even if the training mode was more fun and well thought out it still all boils down to how good the main game is...and frankly the main game isnt very good anyway.
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Happy Puppy,40,The biggest problem area in Mike Tyson Boxing is the controls. Theyre not completely unresponsive but there is a definite delay that affects the overall gameplay and fluidity of the game.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,IGN,35,TotemBall also isnt nearly as intuitive as the PlayStation 2s EyeToy which tracks and translates movement far more accurately and quickly. Nor is the input smartly implemented.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Fork out 40 quid for Hellboy? Hell no! [Sept 2008 p.90]
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,FNintendo,30,Vaccine starts off from an interesting idea and the similarities to the original Resident Evil may raise expectations but unfortunately its concept was not rightly put into place and the result is a game that is built on whats negative - the controls its very outdated graphics and complete lack of variety - and barely touches whats positive as its idea gets easily sidelined by its more negative aspects.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,GameSpy,40,In a way Cortex Command seems like its asking for a lot of concessions because for the most part it still feels like an unfinished game.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameZone,45,Sadly this is a game that certainly does have the potential of being a worthwhile paintball title but falls short in so many ways that even shooter fans will be greatly disappointed.
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,41,This is every bit the under-developed movie tie-in. [Aug 2008 p.63]
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,G4 TV,40,A good-looking but brain-dead thumb-numbing game.
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Hyper Magazine,40,This entry has gone horribly awry. [May 2012 p.83]
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,Eurogamer Portugal,40,This is another game on the long list of uninspired games based on film licenses.
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Worth Playing,45,When I first started playing Sun Age I felt a pang of nostalgia for the way games used to be but it was quickly replaced by the feeling that this would have been a broken title even back then.
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,GameCritics,30,Submersed is a tragic mess of mistakes and in addition to everything above it’s buggy. I had several crashes textures sometimes disappear from walls if one gets too close and I’ve fallen through solid floors. If it wasn’t already obvious that one solid setpiece can’t prop up a mediocre game Submersed should be all the proof that’s required.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Linear and boring shooter with unpleasant lack of checkpoints low IQ enemies and ill-managed main feature – mind capturing. [Issue#201]
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Game Rant,40,Anyone desperate to play this type of game on console will be pleased with the results. Beyond that it’s difficult to wholeheartedly recommend Infinity Runner — but it’s certainly not without its merits.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,GamesRadar+,40,In the end it’s a cool experiment but it quickly goes horribly wrong.
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Game Informer,40,This level of sub-mediocre FPS boredom isnt even close to worth its $20 price point. [June 2005 p.126]
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,40,What youre really fighting in this game is the rules - and boredom. Its boredom that drives me to consume fried delectables and I can tell you I must have gained eight pounds playing Empire of Magic.
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Game Revolution,42,A games strength is not found in its replays nor its deck editing. Its found in its gameplay which is precisely where Evolution Skateboarding falters.
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,Computer Gaming World,40,The grand total of six events feels rather skimpy and theyre very uneven in how well they play. [May 2002 p.90]
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,35,There’s a cynicism deep-rooted in Calvino Noir a heavy darkness you can’t escape. Death is always lurking success is futile. Maybe this is the best representation of noire in games that nobody wanted.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,Gamer.nl,40,At first the game will get your sympathy. It looks nice with its 3D surroundings and cute looking cartoon characters but it wont take long before the very very bad game concept destroys everything that you might like. Tornado offers little less than looking around for objects and remembering were they are when you need them a second time. On top of that you hardly see anything of the surroundings resulting in a well earned insufficient grade.
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,Computer Games Online RO,30,Because no matter how much they fix it Forsaken Gods is a very poor title. I didn’t like it I don’t recommend it and I am saying that not without regrets because we’re still talking about a Gothic game.
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Game Rant,40,MilitAnt‘s poorly implemented targeting system combined with its weak visual presentation and mediocre platforming squander its interesting premise.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Gameplanet,40,Its a nice attempt but ultimately falls short of the entertainment wed expect from such a title. In a market saturated with similarly designed games this one does little to stand out.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,IGN,40,The collision detection in the combat engine is a bit wonky since some punches connect but others dont...and its not exactly fun to miss stabbing someone in the chest by only a pixel or two when theyre down on the ground.
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,G4 TV,40,The same players who found relentless party-balancing corridor fighting ultimately frustrating in a cute cartoony game like Evolution Worlds wont find it any more refreshing here just because its wearing a darker spookier Aliens costume.
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,Yahoo!,40,The most frustrating aspect of the game is the annoyance of not being able to save it until the end of each level.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Wccftech,38,Bombshell sadly shows its origins age and bad design choices. It feels dated on release has too little variety and requires too much back tracking though this doesnt mean that you cant have some fun with the action combined with a great selection of hard rock music.
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,GameOver.gr,40,The development hell problems are quite obvious in Enemy Front. The use of CryEngine and the beloved WWII theme cannot save the mess this game is.
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,40,An abysmal failure. No sense of excitement fear or anything. [July 2009 p.76]
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Play.tm,35,Its ugly its poorly executed its riddled with technical glitches its A.I. is laughable its boring unoriginal and thoroughly unrewarding.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Level7.nu,40,Star Trek is a game with a lot of potential. None of which is being used. The game design is old incomplete and riddled with bugs. The actors make a decent job and the co-op mode is alright but that is the only good things worth mentioning about this otherwise bland and forgettable tie-in to the movie.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpot,39,The main asset to the license -- a degree of smart sexiness akin to old 70s James Bond movie posters -- has become crass and obvious in its translation to 3D.
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,Worth Playing,38,Maybe there is a very small demographic of people who love Egyptian-themed music and are obsessive-compulsive enough to only want to play one type of puzzle endlessly. If so then Word Puzzle was made for them. Otherwise save your points save your time and save yourself the headache.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Atomix,40,If theres a game that fits perfectly as a kusoge (the term that Japanese gamers use for terrible games) Devils Third is definitely one of a kind. Itagakis experiment is a total failure in all of games aspects: bad gameplay mechanics terrible narrative and poor graphics make this title something to avoid.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,AusGamers,35,Floaty imprecise controls a lack of depth random spikes in difficulty due to bad design random frustration a mini-game for the sake of a mini-game and a protagonist with the all the charisma of a shiny blue block.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,GameCritics,30,Blood Knights is representative of the terrible trend in game design where its devs have taken what might have been a mediocre-but-serviceable brawler and packed it full of systems that do nothing for the player but push them further away from the action.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,GamesRadar+,40,Fans of the series might find it entertaining to rescue kidnapped kids while battling the Seven Demon Kings but most people will find precious little to enjoy.
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,Gaming Age,42,What is the purpose of completing the tasks other than unlocking some mini games? I have no idea but the tasks are usually not that bad. In fact some of them are even fun. They must have had some creative writers on staff to come up with the tasks.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Really the biggest problem with Monster Jam is its price--for $20 wed be all over it but $50? Get over your bad self. [Mar 2008 p.92]
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer,40,Sanctum of Slime couldve been partially redeemed with co-op but since its ridiculously limited to local-only(no online or even LAN) few will ever bother to play it on PC. [Aug 2011 p.76]
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,COGconnected,30,The lack of diversity and challenge is boring and the level design doesn’t do anything to help the gameplay.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Eurogamer Portugal,40,The greatest failure of Quantum Theory begins perhaps with the initial target of copying Gears of War as a model to reach new audiences.
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GamesRadar+,30,We might be able to forgive the game its sin of unoriginality and consumer whoring but we can’t forgive them for taking the fun out of shaving a sheep. Tacked-on twitchy controls; lousy graphics and all-round dull gameplay fraught with mindless minigames tank any hope a would-be virtual farmer might have of actually having fun on a farm.
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,IGN,40,New Rally-X is probably fun for the pure nostalgia of it. For new gamers who like old retro games its also a nice way to get acquainted with one really old game that doesnt quite translate to the 21st century.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PC Games,40,Even hardcore fans of Harry Potter have to admit: This adventure is not only boring and without highlights its also designed without any love for videogames or the Potter franchise.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,FNintendo,40,If at its core the game itself remains good - it is after all the same as FIFA 19 - the product being sold under this name is simply not what EA should be presenting to its consumers. While updated squads and jerseys fit perfectly with the idea of a regular update to a football simulation charging a full games price for nothing but an update is simply unacceptable.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,The Sydney Morning Herald,40,Unfortunately the network code controlling everything is poor. Players and vehicles warp all over the place making it next to impossible to hit anything.
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Worth Playing,40,While you have to give credit to Spuds Unearthed for trying to be bold and merging two genres into the VR perspective the execution does not work well. The dodgy controls make a poor impression on those trying out VR for the first time and the lack of a narrative makes it all feel pointless. The lack of proper explanation for anything is what dooms the game as it takes loads of unnecessary trial and error to figure things out from initiating multiplayer to how to set up for fights let alone how to make yourself useful in the skirmishes. While Spuds Unearthed isnt the worst VR experience out there it is certainly one to avoid.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,games(TM),40,It is without a point. It fires its Uzi rounds aimlessly and manages to hit nothing. It’s not bad it’s not horrific it’s not reprehensible and it’s not memorable either.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Play.tm,38,Apart from the topical title Flushed Away shares the same type of brain busting boredom weve all come to expect from these sort of lazy cash-ins with the added disadvantage of leaving itself open for some puntastic criticism... absolute toilet.
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,GameGrin,40,New Gundam Breaker is a good concept shoddily put together. The story is a trope-fest battles are confusing and the masses of text are hard to read. There are so few positive points it’s not funny.
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,PSM3 Magazine UK,43,Unfortunately the games biggest strength is also its downfall. It stays true to the pace and mechanics of the real game. [Nov 2008 p.84]
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Not even nicely suited apes are able to save this repetitive visually obsolete and boring game. You better get drunk before trying this ape hunt. [Issue#207]
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,40,The game becomes the chore it aims to send up. [Nov 2011 p.75]
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Play Magazine,40,Exasperating mini-games; bad AI camera jams and a slap in the face story to any fan...This is not good...no--this is really not good. [Apr 2006 p.63]
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,IGN,34,The laughable A.I. boring level design pedestrian graphics and tattered story make this a game that should be avoided by young and old alike.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Vandal,45,Blades doesn’t live up to the expectations players have for this franchise. It has some interesting features but its gameplay and an old-fashioned free-to-play design make it very forgettable.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Level7.nu,40,Filled to the brim with minigames and old classics but sadly most of them just arent very fun.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Game Informer,35,Those patient enough to suffer through the initial gameplay inadequacies are rewarded with horrible low-quality cutscenes a special Accelerator Suit ability that often drains during said cutscenes unreachable power-ups that hover just out of grasp the worst vehicle controls I’ve used in years and voice overacting that makes the guy who says killing spree in Unreal Tournament sound understated.
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,GameDaily,40,Wrought with visual glitches and pre-existing issues with poor camera angles the mixture of zippy running missions grows tedious at near-Sonic speed with limited control and boring exploration sequences. This one hits a brick wall for sure.
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,XGN,40,Super Dungeon Bros has little to no originality. It is repetitive and there is almost no variation. The weapons are not effective but on the bright side the game is a bit more fun in multiplayer. Still the game is just not worth buying.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,Worth Playing,40,Unfortunately Omerta: City of Gangsters isnt worth playing. The concept is solid as is the decision to split the game into two distinct game types but the execution of both game types is subpar.
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,Nintendophiles,40,This game was just a little too slow (though faster than most) pulled cheap tricks and was lacking in most departments (no stats no Homerun Derby no All-Star Game) and too frustrating.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,IGN,38,Id recommend Anarchy Rulz only to ECW fans and their reaction might only be to wonder where everything they liked about the promotion has gone.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameDaily,40,We just wish the designers paid more attention to the controls and did something dramatic with the gameplay. Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes is a below average adventure thats difficult to recommend even as a rental. We suggest Force pushing it into a galaxy far far away.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,Hardcore Gamer,40,They wanted to give the IP as much space as possible from this train wreck and I’d suggest you give yourself the same.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,44,America’s Army: True Soldiers is essentially a poor man’s version of Ghost Recon or Vegas but you can’t tell from the asking price.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamer.nl,40,Offers little variation and hardly requires strategic input which leaves a mindless third-person shooter. The well-executed story and great looking characters make it a tad more interesting but these elements cant hide the fact that the four-eyed magician often turns to his wands for simple and selfish needs.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,40,Since the story has to be read through terrible talking heads it would be far more enjoyable to just pick up the book. Then the reader can use their imagination to picture characters that dont look deformed environments that arent even blander than real life and action that isnt repetitive and unfulfilling.
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Gamer 2.0,37,On the DS it is a bland and nearly unplayable game that youll probably hate so much that you’d forget what love was.
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,GameSpew,40,In its current state Dead or Alive: Xtreme 3 is a nice game to relax and unwind with but beyond that it’s a very disappointing and lazy entry into the Xtreme series.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,PlayStation LifeStyle,35,Unfortunately if you are stone cold sober and trying to channel your inner Doogie Howser this lack of any tangible precision will prove to be an instant turn-off.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Game Fan,50,This is easily one of the worst racers for the Nintendo 64.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Xbox Nation Magazine,40,There are audio glitches galore with sound effects either missing or repeating themselves over and over for no good reason. [Feb 2005 p.93]
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,MondoXbox,40,Even if based on a very interesting idea Dead Alliance pitifully falls due to too many technical problems that make it practically unplayable.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,Cheat Code Central,40,Suffers from technical problems which will only serve to frustrate meticulous RTS fans.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Eurogamer Sweden,40,It has been delayed for more than a decade and yet it still has parts that look that old and still not finished. A basically broken Aliens game is to some degree saved by Gearboxs unquestionable love for the franchise and the ability to play the campaign split-screen.
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,The Digital Fix,30,Sadly lacking in depth so much so in fact that you can literally play most of it with your eyes closed.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameDaily,40,We just wish the designers paid more attention to the controls and did something dramatic with the gameplay. Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes is a below average adventure thats difficult to recommend even as a rental. We suggest Force pushing it into a galaxy far far away.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,GamesRadar+,30,We suspect that control scheme would work better if it emulated that found in games like Robotron 2084 or Geometry Wars - though that wouldnt be as authentic it could make Tron a fantastic Live Arcade game. But as it is this just doesnt work.
Farscape: The Game,PC,Aug-8-2002,Red Lemon Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Adrenaline Vault,40,Misfires on pretty much all cylinders.
Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Gaming Nexus,40,The long tradition of execrable license tie-ins continues with Justice League Heroes for DS...Even a hardcore Justice League fan will be hard pressed to enjoy this one.
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,NintendoWorldReport,35,Gardening Mama 2 is worthless.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Nintendo Life,40,Ben 10: Omniverse falls into a lot of the same traps that lesser games in this genre do — lots of repetitive button-mashing gameplay uninspired level design and clunky controls.
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,IGN,35,Although the gameplay isnt quite broken since its still physically possible to participate in races it just isnt fun.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Cheat Code Central,40,The latest game is entitled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee and like the last two games threatens to send the Turtles back into hibernation or wherever the hell they went last time.
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PSX Extreme,38,Naughty Bear is just another game that features a great concept but fails miserably in execution which is why you really shouldnt bother paying full pop for this one.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,IGN,35,If Bliss Island were a website of free flash games it would be worthwhile as a distraction. Paying for it is not a good idea.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,IGN,40,Knock off the crap and get to work on something worth playing already!
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,CalmDownTom,40,Rise of the Dark Spark is a decent enough title but its failing is that it changes too much. It’s nothing more than a shallow poorly executed imitation of Fall of Cybertron.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,40,While the runner platformer is fine and the visuals and story behind the game pleasant the end result does not come together to create a cohesive experience worth investing your time into.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,GameSpew,40,It won’t cause as many laughs as it did in Early Access but also won’t give you as many thrills as the originals. Roller Coaster Tycoon World is a fumbled hodgepodge of ideas that are emotionally detached from what makes a Tycoon game great.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Eurogamer Sweden,40,Air Conflicts Vietnam tries to be easy to pick up but merely manages to be easy to put down. The theme of the Vietnam conflict is portrayed well but besides that the experience left me wanting. Lack of AI and some bugged out missions pull the game down from being just mediocre.
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Edge Magazine,40,Its almost a relief that the game struggling to break free from these severe technical shortcomings is mundane. [May 2011 p.104]
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,XGN,25,Because of the lack of depth and a boring gameplay you will only play this title one or at most two times. After that it will rust in the Wii. So its a waste of money to buy this game.
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Theres simply nothing here to justify you buying it ahead of 2Ks b-ball champ. [Jan 2014 p.84]
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Cheat Code Central,44,Hardcore Dynasty Warriors fans will probably get this title for the storyline alone. More casual fans of the series stay away!
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN,40,An extremely sloppy production thats not fun to play and even if you love the series this game might end up turning you off of the franchise.
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Metro GameCentral,30,It looks like Ice Age 4 it sounds like Ice Age 4 and it plays like the frozen carcass of a 5000 year old mammoth.
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Joystiq,40,Wait ... this is a retail game? And you have to pay $50 for it? Unfortunately in spite of a few good ideas Naughty Bear is too sloppily executed and too shallow to recommend -- especially as a full retail experience.

Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,35,The original Nintendo DS game was a terrible collection of mini-games and the Wii version continues that tradition.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Vandal,35,Easy short linear and with embarrasing flaws in AI this game is a huge disappointment.
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer.tv,40,Rengokus clunky control system does well to convince you youre a steel-clad cyborg but unfortunately this rigid feel doesnt lend itself to an enjoyable game. [JPN Import]
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,We Got This Covered,40,WWE 2K20 has its issues and maybe they could have been overlooked if all the game modes worked. Sadly that is not the case and it feels like a broken game from the get-go.
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,GameOver.gr,40,Feelplus and Square-Enixʼs new try in the shooting genre falls way too short compared even to the weakest 3rd-person shooters of the last five years.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,GamesVillage.it,40,ENKI appears as an amateur project something that a group of friends can develop during weekends. Unfortunately it’s a commercial product and it must be treated as such. It’s plagued by lots of design and technical issues and it’s simply not fun.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Gaming Maxx,39,Of course misery loves company. So call up someone you hate and invite them over for hours of terminal and ponderous gaming. Whee!
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,IGN,40,I cant really recommend this game to anyone in good faith even fans jonesing for any motocross game. Stay away.
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Joystiq,40,Venetica contains hints of a compelling quest but feels like its development life was cut short. The end result is a potentially grand concept that just cant flourish within its forced generic confines.
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,RPGamer,40,The potential is still there because Romance Dawn doesnt do nearly enough right to make this an adequate substitute for reading the manga or watching the anime.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Computer Games Magazine,30,Despite the lack of satire and occasional lack of sense the game is mostly playable. However the interface and the odd bugs make it a chore. [July 2006 p.65]
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,PSM3 Magazine UK,36,Overall Flying is sometimes a joy but Iron Man is basically repetitive confusing and graceless.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Game Over Online,40,Outside of climbing up the leaderboards or finding every hidden item theres little reason to return to the game once youve played through it once.
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Is there a single person at SEGA or at the Creative Assembly who thinks they made a really good game? A game someone would want to buy? It’s about time to consider some sacking in both companies. [Apr 2009]
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,InsideGamer.nl,35,Theres a lot wrong with Star Trek. The story is told very averagely environments are boring shooting is unsatisfactory your companion will annoy you to death and boring puzzles might just eradicate most of your brain cells. The only fun I had with this game is thanks to the hilarious bugs.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,TheSixthAxis,30,I’m trying my best to think of some kind of clever joke or metaphor about Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle but I don’t even think the game deserves that kind of effort on my part. Burst Battle is an awful video game. Without a tutorial learning to play is no fun at all and I had an equal sum of zero fun playing it when I actually knew how to play. If you’re itching for a Touhou fighting game run to your PC and download one of the official 2D fighting games from the main series. Never touch Burst Battle. Learn from my errors and live a long healthy fulfilling life.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpy,30,Since the controls are so clunky youll be wobbling to align properly with the criminal in question; so while hes nailing you with bullets your sole concern is landing one shot.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Game Over Online,40,Really I’ve reviewed some bad games in my time but Dino Island is the first that was completely and seemingly intentionally bad.
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,GameSpot,44,This traditional adventure game offers a few attractive scenes but otherwise its an exercise in tedium that will disappoint even avid adventure gamers.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,GameZone,40,Thanks to its broken controls awkward combat mechanics and uninspiring mission objectives it’s hard to recommend this game to dedicated fans of the show.
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,IGN,35,The fighting system itself is has a few interesting features but almost everything else about the game will either frustrate or annoy. The camera the enemy A.I. almost every aspect of the graphics the sound effects and the required mini-games are all decidedly sub-par
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Console Monster,36,Disappointing.
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,Gameblog.fr,30,Its sure that developers of Fear Effect Sedna are huge fans of the franchise. They had some ideas about this new episode and there are a few elements that feel compelling. But in the end there are too many things that just dont work or frustrate the players. Too bad.

Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,RPG Fan,38,Time & Eternity is by far one of the worst RPGs I have ever played and even when accounting for different tastes I cannot recommend it to anyone. At best a select few may enjoy the games sense of humor but Im convinced that the gameplay is so broken that almost anyone will regret purchasing this game.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,GameSpot,29,MC Groovz may feature The Fresh Princes Parents Just Dont Understand but dancing to its poorly stepped overly lengthy tracks just makes us feel like Carlton Banks.
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,40,Bloodforge is gorgeous and has high production values but in the end it lacks depth and the story is so lame its outright impossible to care about anything that happens on screen.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,1UP,40,Other than the exclusive ArchLord gimmick were left with a dated-looking game with limited classes and a lot of grind and a miniscule chance of something cool at the end if you really throw yourself into it. Not exactly our cup of mead.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Nintendojo,42,There’s an earnestness to Rogue Corps that makes it even sadder to see the game fail as it has. There have been updates since the game launched but nothing thus far has been able to elevate Rogue Corps to the standard of quality set by past series installments. If Konami wants to modernize its franchises for future generations the message should be clear: fans want what made those classics so endearing to begin with not misguided radical redesigns.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,IGN Spain,40,Just a plain bad kart game that manages to copy the best game on its genre but fails on doing it.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,Gamervision,40,The best thing I can say about Coraline is that it’s not broken. It works and just about anyone could play it from start to finish but I don’t understand why anyone would want to.
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,Gamers' Temple,39,The graphics are about on par with everything else in the game. The resolution is locked at 800x600 and even if you ignore the blockiness of the graphics the small levels are bland and uninteresting and the cutscenes smack of stock-footage amateurism.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,The Escapist,40,As it is the repetitive missions and poor pacing are ultimately too distracting for the games few virtues to shine through.
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,My Gamer,36,From the glitchy programming the poor graphical quality a camera that never listens to the player and horrific level design Brave: A Warrior’s Tale is an incomplete product.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,Suffers from being in a big sea of similar titles. [Jan 2011]
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,PSM3 Magazine UK,37,Dumb AI stupidly linear crap guns... a disaster. [May 2008 p.79]
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Worth Playing,30,Family Party doesnt bring anything new to the table. It may be a budget-priced title at $20 but I would venture to say that is almost too much to pay for this one.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Nintendo Power,30,Only through sheer force of will have I avoided comparing the enjoyment derived from playing SPRay to that of regurgitating a lung. [Dec 2008 p.93]
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,Riot Pixels,35,This game is equally bad in all of its aspects. The developers should remove all the gameplay and turn Kursk into a free virtual tour of the submarine.
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,XboxAddict,40,There was a lot of hype behind Hello Neighbor and Ive even started seeing merch at stores to purchase but at this point in time it hasn’t lived up to it yet not even close. The ideas are there as is the premise and backdrop but the execution is severely lacking in the worst possible way. Sure some fixes might make it a better experience but there’s no way this should be a full release in its current state. With all this in mind I say Goodbye Neighbor.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,VGPub,40,If you’re really into battleship warfare or looking for something to get your grandfather who’s a World War Two navy vet that needs something else to play on his DS besides Brain Age you’ll like this game. Everyone else should go play Advance Wars: DS or one of its earlier titles.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Play (Poland),40,A role playing game that poses as a strategy by using just the numbers. This means that your adventuring party can have as many as twenty or thirty members and you have to take care of every soldiers needs and wants from armor to magic crystals to retirement plans. The games ugly looks combined with the unintelligible interface and bad AI make the whole thing marginally playable in the best moments and huge pain in the posterior in the worst. [Apr 2008]
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GameSpot,35,If Rock Revolution came out two or three years ago it might have been revolutionary but in 2008 its not even relevant. Uninspired presentation a tiny tracklist that includes no master tracks a complete lack of vocal support uninteresting gameplay and a barebones Career mode are just a few of the many ways in with Rock Revolution fails.
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,SpazioGames,40,A bad remaster of a mediocre game. Why someone decided to put money into developing this we don’t and cannot know. If you want to get dirty just jump in a puddle even the mud is not that great in this game.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,43,Not the best but Fatal Conspiracy is better than its individual parts would have you believe. [Jan 2011 p.82]
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,IGN,30,Go! Sports Skydiving is slightly better than Go! Sports Ski. Nuff said.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,NZGamer,40,As the plodding narrative progresses these repetitive fighting and stealth tasks grow quickly tedious.
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,GameSpot,35,Has virtually no lasting value whatsoever and just isnt much fun to play even as long as it lasts.
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Gaming Age,33,The AI basically flip flops around from being faster than any other racer out there to racers who lack that gray matter up in the head called brain.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpot,31,The environments are no fun to get through fights are infrequent and the simplistic combat is unfulfilling.
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,40,At the beginning of the game there is a gut wrenching choice to be made of whether you want to be a mage a hunter or a fighter. We have played racing games with more original RPG-elements than this utterly dull game. [June 2013 p.86]
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Play UK,33,Theres just no depth to Xaolin Showdown whatsoever. [Issue #150 p.89]
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,TheXboxHub,30,I understand that delays post-launch patches and day one updates are now par for the gaming course but that doesn’t mean that a game shouldn’t be held back if it’s not up to scratch. Case in point: Tennis World Tour.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,GameFocus,41,Bad jumping mechanics.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,ActionTrip,42,This game can be completed from start to finish in two hours. I am not joking. Whats more is theres no incentive to go back and replay anything in this game. All in all the PC version of this magnificent film with an equally magnificent console game does not measure up to either side of its namesake.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,40,In short Shattered Universe just doesnt deliver. The onscreen action never heats up enough to be considered exciting and even if it did the shoddy control scheme would keep it from being any fun anyway. [Dec 2003 p.176]
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,40,Sega struggled to deliver a compelling superhero experience with the first Iron Man game but even now armed with a new developer and second playable hero the sequel falls similarly flat. [July 2010 p.88]

Deca Sports 3,Wii,Oct-26-2010,Hudson | NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Sports | General | General,Nintendo Life,30,Greater options for customisation would have helped a bit as would options for differing control styles but ultimately Deca Sports 3 is flawed enough at its core that no amount of additional features would help it much. Sorry sports fans.
Rugby 18,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Koch Media,Sports | Team | Rugby,The Games Machine,40,Terrifying is the right word to tell something about Rugby 18. The game is very far from what actually happens on the pitch and its not fun at all.
Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,Worth Playing,40,The content isnt even worth a laugh and the story is so full of holes (is this based on a Croatian comic or show? It seems to expect you to know the cast in advance) and clichés that it has no value unless youre a die-hard fan of Eastern European culture.
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,IGN,40,Whatever redeeming aspects it may have had are marred by a plethora of inconveniences and annoyances that round out boring repetitive play.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,GameDaily,40,Iron Man 2 suffers from the same lack of energy as the first game and despite a few interesting ideas comes up short. Save your cash and go see the movie instead.
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,Eurogamer Italy,40,The ghost of Wayward Manor surely has lots of limitations and ends up being haunted by all the wasted potential of the game.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GameFocus,40,It still has some elements that make it slightly enjoyable but with the wealth of other experiences on XBLA its really hard to justify investing your hard earned Microsoft Points in a second hand toy.
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Sadly Cyberball 2072 doesnt live up to our feelings of nostalgia and a couple of design choices by the dev team leave this port on the wrong side of the line of scrimmage. [Dec 2007 p.78]
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,NintendoWorldReport,40,Cybertron Adventures has way too many problems to be worth your time. The lackluster and unstable gameplay make the whole experience unfufilling.
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,The A.V. Club,33,You have to struggle with touchy controls and flaws in the game logic. For example if you hang onto a human shield for too long the cops will just shoot your hostage to get him out of the way. How is that fair to anybody?
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,Worth Playing,30,Even if you found yourself enjoying Gothic 4 I cant suggest that you pick up the expansion Fall of Setarrif. Its a poorly constructed add-on to a mediocre game.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,Gamervision,35,Its a shame because theres likely something deep within thats worth paying attention to but it is surrounded so completely by problems that it simply cannot be worth the effort.

One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,ZTGD,35,I turned the game off with a One Way Trip to the delete key. I appreciate what they were going for here but it wasn’t for me in the slightest.
Alien Blast: The Encounter,PC,Feb-9-2004,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GameSpot,33,Across every category Alien Blast defines itself as the very epitome of boredom. The action is dull repetitive and in some cases a bit broken. The games graphics are pretty much a sad underdeveloped joke.
Robot Arena,PC,Apr-1-2001,Gabriel Interactive,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Breeding/Constructing,GameSpot,39,Even at the low retail cost of $19.99 Robot Arena isnt worth it. Youd end up getting more entertainment if you randomly chose two movies at an over-priced movie theater.
Rally Challenge 2000,Nintendo 64,Jun-30-2000,Europress,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,CNET Gamecenter,40,Although the actual car models are quite nice the N64s infamous fog--which makes for about 10 feet of visibility even in sunny conditions--and the blurry washed-out textures undermine the games few good points.
Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,PALGN,40,Emergency Heroes is a below average game that is ultimately far too dull to be enjoyable.
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,GameSpot,34,7554 is a modern curiosity that plays like a shabby relic.
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,GamesRadar+,40,The soundtrack is a shocking state of affairs the cars sounding how you think mud would sound if it could talk and in the background is a Europop house soundtrack.
Timeline,PC,Nov-12-2000,Timeline Computer Entertainment,Action | General | General,All Game Guide,40,The battles the excitement and the potential mix of science fiction with history is all lost in a stilted game environment that was obviously crafted by Crichtons vision of what the game should be vs. the ultimate goal of creating a good game.
MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,GameFocus,35,MotionSports Adrenaline will inevitably find itself in the bargain bin a few months down the road and you will see it...then pass it on by for that fresh copy of Bomberman: Act Zero.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Wii,Nov-16-2010,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Nintendo Gamer,30,This is such a technical and conceptual mess that EA wouldnt send us a copy - we had to go out and buy it. [Christmas 2010 p.53]
The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,MEGamers,32,No matter how hard you look trying to find something good about this game you won’t come up with anything. Trust me I tried.
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,ZTGD,40,I was excited for the return of Gungrave. Especially since PlayStation VR had been so impressive for me recently diving into the technology. Sadly this experience is just not worth dropping the cash for. There are a ton of better VR experiences for Sony’s headset.
Waking,PC,Jun-18-2020,Jason Oda,Action | General,BaziCenter,40,They say never judge a book by the cover as whats inside almost always is better than whats outside. In Wakings case however the only pretty thing is the cover. Shallow and broken gameplay? Check. Bad controls? Check. Poor visuals? Check. Innovations?. Nowhere to be found. Worth a shot? Probably not.
JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,Trickstar Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,Vandal,35,A less-than-satisfying return of the Janes series rebooting as an arcade game that doesnt feel good. Its gameplay is poor and limited its campaign boring and its online mode lacks variety.
Taito Legends Power-Up,PSP,May-17-2007,Empire Oxford,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Gamers Europe,30,Kazook is nothing but a host of buzzwords and heavily stereotyped characters mashed clumsily together with unoriginal games that quickly plummet into a repetitive tedium.
Rapala Tournament Fishing!,Wii,Nov-22-2006,MagicWand,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Game Almighty,35,Rapala Pro Fishing Trophy is a game that proves why fishing mini-games work so well in other games. It’s a little bit of fun for a short while but really lacks the depth (no pun intended) that a great fishing game needs.
DARK,PC,Jul-3-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Initially a terrible thing that becomes a relatively entertaining stealth action game if you manage to (literally) bite your way through. Unfortunately excellent ideas are screwed up by their problematic elaboration. [Issue#232]

Lets Fish! Hooked On,PlayStation Vita,Jan-29-2013,SIMS,Sports | Individual | Nature | Fishing | Fishing,Gaming Nexus,35,I really wanted this to be good but it turned out to be a total mess. Let’s Fish is comprised of a bunch of great ideas and potential that never come to fruition. Its gameplay is overly simple and the technical aspects of the game are at odds with each other. Just stay away...far far away.
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,PC,Oct-17-2006,Apeiron,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | General | Modern,GameDaily,40,The game looks and plays cheaply and lacks direction. Players waste time trying to conduct solo missions early on when the heart of this game focus on squad tactics. Terrible translations boring environments and unintelligent enemies further ruin the experience.
Turtle Tale,3DS,May-22-2014,Saturnine Games,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,God is a Geek,30,Even at just shy of three quid this feels like poor value. Small developers should be taking these opportunities to create interesting and worthwhile ideas not pointless relics like Turtle Tale that belong on a Mastertronic cassette in the darkest recesses of gaming’s past.
Street Supremacy,PSP,Feb-28-2006,Genki,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Yahoo!,40,Street Supremacy may be pretty cool for its strategic twist but when actually getting behind the wheel is so ponderous and unengaging then for all you care those other gangs can just have Tokyo.
Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,Official Xbox Magazine,35,Unfortunately the major addition for its XBLA debut - Kinect integration - is poorly implemented leaving an otherwise shallow and dated experience.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,GamerFeed,40,Theres a decent selection of songs but the frequent loading limited game play and repetitive nature of the title just make it too boring for most to handle after a handful of sessions with the game.
101-in-1 Sports Party Megamix,Wii,Jan-13-2011,Nordcurrent,Sports | General | General,RealGamer,30,101-in-1 Sport Party Megamix is undoubtedly lacking the quality of its competition despite the fact that it features 101 mini-games to play.
007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Eurogamer Sweden,40,This mediocre Bond game brings nothing new. Almost saved by solid multiplayer fun and some cool gadgets but sadly the monotonic gameplay and almost identical boss fights sink what could have been a proper salute to the 50 year old movie franchise.
Mall Tycoon,PC,Feb-3-2002,Holistic Design | Inc.,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Game Over Online,38,Mall Tycoons anemic execution really turns any simulation aspects into micromanagement chaos.
Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project,Xbox 360,Jun-23-2010,3D Realms,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Horizontal,IGN,40,Maybe if the price was halved Id feel a little easier about the thought of people buying Manhattan Project but at its release its a rip-off compared what else is on the market.
Clash of the Titans,PlayStation 3,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Game Informer,40,The recent Clash of the Titans film was a mildly entertaining display of special effects. The game contains all of the films camp but lacks the spectacle of million-dollar CG krakens to help save it.
0 Day Attack on Earth,Xbox 360,Dec-23-2009,Gulti,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Kombo,35,Between the lackluster visuals and uninspired gameplay theres very little to like about 0 Day.
Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,PSFocus,39,Iron Man 2 the movie is pretty cool but the game is the complete opposite. The graphics are poor and look like those of a PlayStation 2 game and the audio isn’t great either. The gameplay is repetitive and there is no atmosphere in the game. Don’t buy this game it’s too bad and that’s a shame.
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,Gameblog.fr,40,Dollhouse has a fascinating universe but poor gameplay and poor graphics that makes it a frustrating experience.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,IGN,39,If your stupid game is as fun as watching a pet die as attractive as an eight-legged dwarf and as generally cool as getting your chest ruptured by an angered moose its bloody well not going to sell or be critically-freaking-acclaimed!
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Switch Player,30,Save your money on this one and opt for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Nickelodeon Kart Racers is not an enjoyable racer to play and whilst it has some interesting ideas adding an RPG element to the mix it doesnt make up for the rest of this half baked package.
Way of the Dogg,Xbox 360,May-3-2013,Echo Peak,General | Action | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Way of the Dogg is a squandered opportunity to fill a genre gap in the Arcade. Its a quick hours job to mop up 300G though. So theres always that.
4PM,PC,Jul-9-2014,Bojan Brbora,Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Multiplayer.it,30,4PM cant be considered a game rather it is an experiment. Poorly executed unfortunately. Bad visuals awkward narrative chunky controls make for an unacceptable 4 € price tag. Thumbs down.
WWII Aces,Wii,Mar-21-2008,Arcade Moon,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,GameSpot,35,WWII Aces is a frustrating ugly flight combat game with antiquated design elements and unresponsive motion controls.
Delta Force: Xtreme 2,PC,May-27-2009,NovaLogic,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,Absolute Games,40,This game’s failure was perfectly described back in 1865 by Lewis Carroll: Now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that! You cant stop the progress.
Slain!,PC,Mar-24-2016,Wolf Brew Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Destructoid,35,Im sure it can and probably will get better over time with polish but whats here at launch is disappointing. I struggle to picture Slain! ever becoming genuinely good barring major reworks.
Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Destructoid,40,The bad news is that this entertaining and occasionally surprising narrative is wrapped around an inadequately polished Hitman knockoff.
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Gaming Age,33,The game needed a lot more time in development and it never got that opportunity to mature.
The Polar Express,GameCube,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,35,This is a kids game. Its also a bad kids game. And theres really no getting around that.
Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,IGN,35,Its one of those games that cuts so many corners you almost dont even notice that the same musical track plays through the whole thing because youve lowered your expectations so much.
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameSpot,34,Evil Dead: Hail to the King unfortunately offers little of the appeal of its source material as everything about the game is derivative boring or just plain bad.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Online deathmatches are an abandoned ship. [Sept 2010 p.81]
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,Metro GameCentral,30,It was arguably never very good even back in the day but playing it now The Chaos Engine’s basic action is hopelessly outclassed by any number of retro and contemporary titles.
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendojo,35,Anyone looking for a game that plays in the old Space Invaders style can surely find an arcade compilation somewhere. The just move right and left and shoot the enemies idea was great back in the 1980s but it just doesnt cut it by todays standards.
