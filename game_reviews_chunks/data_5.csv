NBA 2K9,Xbox 360,Oct-7-2008,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,1UP,91,The game shines particularly bright in the Total Team Control mode which allows you to hook up online with nine other players for 5-on-5 basketball. This mode simulates the experience of playing an actual game of basketball more closely than any videogame I've played.
Red Faction II,PlayStation 2,Oct-15-2002,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Cinescape,100,The game looks ten times more impressive that its predecessor and really outshines almost any other console first-person shooter on the market right now. Explosions look extremely realistic and the enemies are modeled and rendered pretty well.
Disciples II: Dark Prophecy,PC,Jan-22-2002,Strategy First,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Yahoo!,100,Outstanding in every way. All of the story elements fantasy fiction races and winning design elements have been retained albeit in greatly enhanced forms that make everything feel fresh.
Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams,Xbox,Dec-20-2001,KCET,Action Adventure | Horror,Electric Playground,100,In a game already so dark and visually menacing the Xbox gives the phrase "jumping at your own shadow" a whole new shade of meaning.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2,Nintendo 64,Aug-21-2001,Edge of Reality,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Games Radar,100,There are so many modes multi-player games and features that could easily have you seeing less and less daylight as time goes on.
Frostpunk,PC,Apr-24-2018,11 bit studios,Action Adventure | Survival,Strategy Gamer,100,I’ve never cared about the people under my command in any game more than in Frostpunk. The window-dressing isn’t perfect. Aspects of the experience are frustrating; a couple of failed games can leave one a tiny weeny bit annoyed. I am not even sure if some of the scenarios are even possible! Yet if the perfect game is a series of choices where every choice has meaning then Frostpunk is it.
Fight Night Round 3,PlayStation 2,Feb-20-2006,EA Chicago,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Game Over Online,93,A fantastic boxing title that really delivers the action in a realistic way for fight fans and those discovering the sweet science for the first time on their home console.

Football Manager 2020,PC,Nov-18-2019,Sports Interactive,Sports | Team | Soccer | Management,Daily Star,100,Football Manager is back and its focus on long-term construction of a footballing powerhouse is refreshing for a series that previously felt solely focused on the short-to-mid term. The only challenge you'll have now is keeping in the board's good graces long enough to leave your imprint on a club.
Nex Machina: Death Machine,PC,Jun-20-2017,Housemarque,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Game Informer,93,Immaculate level design devilish enemy placement and a steady but always punishing difficulty curve help Nex Machina stand head and shoulders above most competing shooters not to mention the early arcade titles that inspired it like Robotron: 2084. That’s meaningful as Nex Machina was created in cooperation with Eugene Jarvis one of the designers of that early classic game. Nex Machina is far deeper than first impressions might suggest and can offer many hours of searing challenge presuming you’re willing to face a little eye strain. Blinking is not encouraged.

Streets of Rage 4,PC,Apr-30-2020,Lizardcube,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,DarkStation,100,Streets of Rage 4 left me feeling like a ten-year-old kid playing his Genesis again while still managing to bring modern gameplay and variety to a classic series. There was no way for me to keep my expectations low with this series returning yet Lizardcube still managed to blow those expectations away. I can say without hesitation that this is the pinnacle of a long-dormant series and genre; a game I'm confident I'll be returning to for years to come.
Polybius,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Llamasoft,Action | Shooter | Rail,VRFocus,100,Polybius is an excellent shooter that takes inspiration from the 80s arcade scene in the best of ways. It is a finely crafted experience that only benefits from being on the PlayStation VR. It can be an intense experience however and one best left to relatively short gameplay sessions lest the visual overload become too much. Owners of PlayStation VR should definitely look to add this to their library as it is one of the best VR titles on the PlayStation at present. Jeff Minter and Llamasoft have got another winner.
Crysis Warhead,PC,Sep-16-2008,Crytek,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,3DJuegos,96,CryTek demonstrates again its hegemony in first person shooters and it does it with a new gem. A brief campaign but charged with a shining pace is its main attractive and in this occasion the multiplayer section has become one of its main highlights too. A new demonstration of the unquestionable health of the action in the 21st century. We don´t usually like to talk about the price in the final conclusions but the possibility to buy a game like Crysis Warhead for just 30 € is a fact to consider.
BioShock: The Collection,Switch,May-29-2020,2K Games | Virtuos,Miscellaneous | Compilation,DarkStation,100,All in all is the Bioshock Collection worth picking up on Nintendo Switch? I would absolutely recommend it. As I mentioned whether you have played them before or not the hybrid console is a fantastic way to experience each of these titles and the excellent result of the port alone should be enough to entice players new and old. The games have amazing stories truly unique settings and memorable characters and locations that everyone should jump into.

It actually leaves one feeling a bit sorry for Forza Horizon which is a very good game and infinitely superior to its predecessors. But Need For Speed: Most Wanted is by whatever criteria you may see fit to apply a great game.

Even after completing it I still felt an addiction to find every single item and upgrade all abilities. I can play for hours and not get bored. It has everything you could imagine a platformer to have. I played on normal and have a feeling I’ll start a new game plus on a harder difficulty. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is easily going to be a favorite for many people. I am beyond impressed with the production value as well as the combat and excellent story. I can’t express how much I recommend this to everyone. It’s an experience you won’t want to miss.

FIFA 18,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,EA Vancouver,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,Gaming Age,100,My opinion on sports games comes down entirely to two factors: how good is the career mode and how well does it represent the sport. And on both those counts FIFA 18 delivers in spades.

Assassin's Creed Origins,PC,Oct-27-2017,Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gaming Age,100,Assassin’s Creed Origins manages to live up to the expectation that the preview event gave me. I dubbed it “near perfect” after that event and the final product does not disappoint. A few pacing issues late in the story caused things to drag a little bit and the loot system doesn’t remain intriguing after the first few hours but finding a complaint beyond that is difficult. You can nitpick some of the graphical hiccups or complain about repetitive side quests but even those manage to stay fun and interesting with all of the different styles of play. On a day with two other heavy hitting AAA games and an amazing TV show releasing simultaneously your time and money are going to be precious commodities. With Game of the Year talks coming up Assassin’s Creed Origins is a serious contender for the title in my book.
Shatter (2009),PC,Mar-15-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Action | General | General,Cheat Code Central,92,Shatter is a brilliant expansion to traditional arcade-style gameplay and how often can you say that a new contender has improved on a classic?

The length difficulty and corny story will turn a lot of people off but the incredible gameplay and thrill of climbing the leaderboards is more than enough to keep this gamer engaged.

If you've already played it it's still as awesome as ever - with the added bonus of Race Mode.

It's an intelligent nuanced design with fathoms of depth which marks a return to the importance of player creativity in shooters and simultaneously evolves the concept of interactivity in an FPS world.

SUPERHOT VR,PC,Dec-5-2016,SUPERHOT,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Road to VR,91,Superhot VR is built upon a one-of-a-kind bullet-time mechanic that translates phenomenally well to VR. After a slow start you'll find that the game is part action and part puzzle as you dodge incoming firing in slow motion while finding the most effective way to shatter your enemies. The core gameplay is challenging and enjoyable though it comes up just short of hitting a masterful climax of game mechanics. The story elements are mostly distractions and like many of the best VR experiences we're left wishing there was more than the 2 or so hours of gameplay available. [Tested with Oculus Touch]

Call of Duty: Black Ops 4,PlayStation 4,Oct-12-2018,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Telegraph,100,It is mechanics that glue Black Ops 4 together then rather than any particular theme which helps each component drill down into what its good at.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night,PC,Jun-18-2019,ArtPlay,Action | Role-Playing | Platformer | Action RPG | 2D,Twinfinite,100,Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is as close to perfect as fans of metroidvania games could hope for.

Plus plenty of other game modes await after the final boss is slain such as Boss Rush. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night has enough to keep gamers hooked for nights on end and it’s only going to get bigger as time goes on.
Hakuoki: Kyoto Winds,PlayStation Vita,May-16-2017,Idea Factory | Otomate,Adventure | Visual Novel,Gaming Age,100,the story is actually interesting. In general terms of course the game is focused on the main character Chizuru romancing the various Shinsengumi samurai but there's a clear plot beyond that: she's traveled to Kyoto to find her missing father. After she stumbles into a bad situation almost immediately upon her arrival (in which the Shinsengumi play a prominent role) everything that happens in the game is set in motion. It's appropriately mysterious which makes this game much closer to an actual novel than most of its other genre brethren.

Life is Strange 2: Episode 5 - Wolves,PC,Dec-3-2019,DONTNOD Entertainment,Action Adventure | General,TheGamer,100,If you've played the first Life Is Strange or its prequel then you'll already be aware that developers Don't Nod are fans of making onion chopping ninjas appear while you're gaming. You'll happily be making (what you thought were) smart choices when suddenly that smart choice doesn't look so hot anymore. I knew going in that this was going to be a rough journey. What I didn't know was how incredibly sensitively handled and well-told this traumatizing tale would be. Life Is Strange 2 tackles a number of issues with racism being the most prominent and Episode Five continues in the same vein as the earlier ones. It skillfully weaves choices that really matter into a heartbreaking but incredibly moving finale for two brothers who have finally come to the end of the road. Continue scrolling to keep reading Click the button below to start this article in quick view. Start now The Story So Far While this review won't include spoilers for Episode Five it's assumed that you've played the first four chapters. If you haven't why are you reading this review instead of catching up? After the traumatic aftermath of their father's death Sean and Daniel went on the run. Right from the start the choices you made mattered and Episode Five really shows this. You can even choose if you saved Arcadia Bay in the first game which is reflected in the later narrative of Episode 5 especially in this final part. RELATED: Arise: A Simple Story Review: Here Come The Waterworks After numerous nasty incidents mostly involving racists taking against the boys for being Mexican and a close call with the police we left the boys in the aftermath of a dramatic escape. After Daniel was brainwashed by a cult while Sean was in the hospital Sean and the boys' mother Karen mounted a rescue. As Episode Four concluded the brothers finally looked at peace as they drove off with Karen. The Wolf Brothers The episode begins with some bonding between the brothers. Enjoy this peace as things are about to get very rough. Predictably the calm doesn't last and the brothers are on the road once more still hoping to reach the Mexican border and finally Puerto Lobos. In some ways this episode is less traumatic than others. Episode Four was a rollercoaster from start to finish but this finale slows the pace at least in the beginning. It's a welcome relief and gives players a chance to catch their breath a little as they meet some interesting characters including someone who will be very familiar to fans of the first game. RELATED: Choose Your Own Adventure: 10 Games Where Your Decisions Really Matter We also find out more about the brothers' history their mother and some other interesting details that fill in their background. There are also some intriguing interactions that will vary depending on if Arcadia Bay is still around. While we enjoyed the lighter story it only made us love the boys even more which in turn makes the ending even more difficult to cope with. When things predictably begin to fall apart the boys flee and as we saw in the trailer finally reach that border. What happens next depends on you. Every Choice Counts In the first game the player was offered a choice which led to two different endings both equally traumatic. This follow-up is not quite so clear cut. While players only have a choice of two alternatives for the final decision the outcomes for each depend on previous choices. There are actually four distinctly different endings each with a mix of happiness and tragedy. There is also a slight variant to one ending and three slightly different alternatives to another. As you can imagine with this many endings every single choice counts even down to the little things that slowly impacted your relationships. Tackling Important Issues All throughout the episodes the issue of racism has been tackled while homophobia was touched upon. This final episode continues in that vein with both issues once again explored. These are sensitive topics that have been handled incredibly well. The narrative in this last episode is just as engaging sensitive and well-written as those which came before it. There's no jarring difference and no huge letdown. RELATED: Pine Switch Review: Beauty That Is Only Skin Deep This time around while the drama is not on a "destroying an entire town" scale it's actually more traumatizing as so much of it is rooted in the consequences of racism. I've never felt my white privilege more than I did playing this. So many of these incidents sadly do happen and that realism is what makes this harder to stomach. Watching Sean explain racism to Daniel still breaks my heart almost as much as the loss of Mushroom did. A Satisfying Finale As expected the graphics narrative and soundtrack are absolutely stunning throughout. This series is known for its attention to detail and this is never more apparent than in some of the tiny details you'll notice in Wolves. The pace can feel slightly slow at times and there are a couple of moments that made me want to scream at the boys to hurry up but it's all part of the story. Ultimately they are very minor annoyances due to my impatience and the pace is generally well thought out building up the finale well. While not all the endings are happy with one in particular being especially traumatizing they all feel realistic and in line with the choices you need to make to get to each one. Each has elements of joy and sadness and this feels right for the script. After all they left a large amount of chaos behind them which can't fail to have an effect on them or anyone playing this beautiful game.

Its visuals are at times mesmerising rooting its aesthetic in traditional Mexican art; the core gameplay loop has a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling encouraging mastery of the mechanics; and the script irons out the kinks of the first game's story in order to offer a more compelling narrative with a stronger comedic identity. Guacamelee! 2 is without a doubt one of the strongest Metroidvanias in recent memory.

Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire,PC,Sep-22-2017,ArenaNet,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer,RPG Fan,90,Path of Fire is a much better expansion than Heart of Thorns and the best part about it is it will only set you back $30. The Guild Wars 2 base game is already free to play and if you want both expansions you can get them combined for $50. You are essentially getting years worth of content for the price of one game. If you have already played Guild Wars 2 before but have left for one reason or another and are on the fence about returning I could not recommend a better time to come back. The Guild Wars 2 of 2017 is a very different game then you probably remember and that's a good thing. Change in MMOs keeps them fresh and fun for years to come and Guild Wars 2 embraces this better than any other MMO on the market. Praise Joko!

No More Heroes,Wii,Jan-22-2008,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,G4 TV,100,The real triumph of Suda 51’s surreal occasionally obscene romp is that behind all the cynicism satire and gory ultraviolence lies a true joy of creation that is too rarely seen in gaming. In playing No More Heroes one gets the impression that the development team truly enjoyed making it that no idea was thrown out for being too ridiculous or far-fetched and that it is intensely aware of its own absurdity at all times. The excellent fourth-wall shattering ending is proof enough of that.
Fight Night Round 3,Xbox,Feb-23-2006,EA Chicago,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Game Over Online,93,Fight Night Round 3 is a fantastic boxing title that really delivers the action in a realistic way for fight fans and those discovering the sweet science for the first time on their home console.

Comet Crash,PlayStation 3,Apr-2-2009,Pelfast,Strategy | General | General,Thunderbolt,90,Comet Crash certainly isn't the most sophisticated looking tower defense title but if you pass it up because of its simplistic visuals you're truly missing out. It's chock full of clever design and great unit/tower balancing plus it has some of the most generally engaging local multiplayer found on the PlayStation Store.

Kingdom Hearts III,PlayStation 4,Jan-29-2019,Square Enix,Action RPG | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Role-Playing | Action RPG,PlayStation LifeStyle,100,The developer has refined and perfected the combat.

Bit.Trip Presents...Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien,PlayStation Vita,Dec-17-2013,Gaijin Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Gaming Age,91,The guiding intention behind Runner 2 on consoles generally seemed to be to make players work to finish each level — to make them memorize the layout for each level and then hit all the buttons in the right order at the right times — and that's survived the game's transition to the PS Vita wholly intact.
Racing Gears Advance,Game Boy Advance,Feb-8-2005,Orbital Media | Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade,AceGamez,90,For some the difficulty may be a little frustrating and later on in the game it seems a little fruitless to fork out on weapons but it's balanced clever and exciting almost forcing you to have one more go.

Darkest Dungeon,PlayStation 4,Sep-27-2016,Red Hook Studios,Role-Playing | General,IGN,91,Darkest Dungeon is a grim and merciless tactical strategy game whose great tension comes from its many layers of complexity unpredictable randomization and willingness to put our fragile characters in mortal danger if we dare to venture into its depths in search of treasure and glory. Brilliant narration and stiff yet surprisingly expressive animation make it easy to be drawn into its vague but tantalizing world though the end feels artificially out of reach.

Bleed 2,PC,Feb-8-2017,BootdiskRevolution,Action | Platformer | 2D,Hardcore Gamer,90,There are certain games that are ubiquitous for the Steam user. Pretty much everyone has Portal in their Steam library. Copies of Thomas Was Alone are more common than sand in the Mojave. Bleed 2 needs to be one of those.

This is something that just cannot be said about even some of the best games on the market. Considering that even its base price is under ten dollars there is no reason to miss out. Skipping Bleed 2 is like shoving toothpicks under your fingernails. Sure it can be done but it hurts and there is no point.

The Elder Scrolls Online: Summerset,PC,May-21-2018,ZeniMax Media,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer,GameSpace,90,Elder Scrolls Online: Summerset is an exciting new chapter for the MMO. It offers an engaging narrative that kept this progression driven gamer distracted which is saying a lot. Although the expansion didn’t offer a new class we were introduced to a pretty fun new skill tree and despite the grind to unlock it it offers some great new approaches to combat. With a beautiful new zone intriguing story and only a few minor grievances I highly recommend picking up Summerset.

It has a labyrinthine plot that bravely attempts to give eight characters the same scope and development as eight sole protagonists would get in lesser games. It’s also a game that bravely makes the story all about those characters with the world harsh as it can be almost secondary to the insular unit and their individual arcs. That sheer ambition is all the more impressive because Octopath Traveller uses sprites. Little 2D characters made up of even littler squares. People need to play this game if only to realise that not everything spectacular needs to be photo-real.

Picross 3D,DS,May-3-2010,HAL Labs,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Logic | Logic,Giant Bomb,100,Picross 3D gets hard.

[Grade = A+]
Mega Man Zero / ZX Legacy Collection,Switch,Feb-25-2020,Capcom,Miscellaneous | Compilation,GamingTrend,95,Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection is easily the best Legacy Collection to date while including the entire Zero and ZX series. While the Zero games may be a bit unfair due to the zoomed-in GBA view and unforgiving lives system the new save-assist feature gives players the ability to play through these games at their own pace without feeling like they’re given too much power. Z-Chaser is lastly a good bonus game even if it is lacking in the level department.
The Swapper,PlayStation 4,Aug-5-2014,Facepalm Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,CalmDownTom,100,So many puzzle platformers suffer from issues like length and boring puzzles but The Swapper delivers on all fronts and then also adds an intriguing story with questions about morality and humanity that are incredibly interesting.
Mighty Flip Champs!,DS,Jun-1-2009,WayForward,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Nintendo Life,90,Creating a great game idea is impressive in and of itself but you have to appreciate it when a developer goes the extra mile and surrounds that great game play idea with high quality artwork and music to give the overall experience that little something extra.

Prey (2006),PC,Jul-11-2006,Human Head Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Detroit Free Press,100,Prey is touted as having an adaptive difficulty system -- the better you are the better it gets -- and it really did seem to get harder as the game went on. As a result there are just two difficulty settings Normal and Cherokee and I'd advise that even vets might want to give Normal a try on the first run out letting the game's artificial intelligence pick up the pace to a comfortable level.
LEGO Marvel Super Heroes,PlayStation 4,Nov-15-2013,TT Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Open-World,DarkStation,100,LEGO Marvel Super Heroes represents Traveler’s Tales finest work with the LEGO property.

Castlevania: Lords of Shadow,Xbox 360,Oct-5-2010,Mercury Steam,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gaming Age,100,It's a great game separate from the franchise and definitely does a favor for the third person action genre but with the CV characters and license attached it becomes even more enjoyable for me.
Sine Mora,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Digital Reality | Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical | Horizontal,DarkStation,90,Sine Mora is a quality title from the look to the feel of it and there could be a lot of useful comparisons between it and other members of the bullet hell genre.

Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII,PSP,Mar-24-2008,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,PSX Extreme,98,It plays like a dream blurring the lines between both genres that it covers much more than any other game. And it looks the part too as it is easily the best looking handheld game you'll see to date along with God of War.
Starseed Pilgrim,PC,Apr-16-2013,Droqen,Simulation | General | General,Games.cz,100,The only hint you are going to find after your opening of the readme.txt file is laconical: "Keep on as long as you have questions." With my verdict it's the same thing.

Darksiders,Xbox 360,Jan-5-2010,Vigil Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Modern | Open-World,Play Magazine,100,If ever there was a pure gamer’s game Darksiders is it.
MLB 08: The Show,PSP,Mar-4-2008,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,1UP,91,A must-play that'll dominate your PSP all summer long.
Alan Wake,PC,Feb-16-2012,Remedy Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern | Horror | Horror | Survival,Gaming Age,91,Arguably the best compliment I can give Alan Wake is that it is a console-to-PC port done right.

Karaoke Revolution,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2003,Harmonix Music Systems,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Cheat Code Central,100,Hands down this is an excellent program. It's much more than a game and that's why I'm referring to it as a program. Every karaoke and potential karaoke singer should get this. Not only is it a lot of fun but it's one of the best ways to improve one's vocal prowess.
Hitman 2: Silent Assassin,GameCube,Jun-19-2003,Io Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern,GameCube Europe,92,The first level is no pushover yet immensely entertaining and freeform as is the entire game. This is a must have unless the site of blood makes you squeamish.

Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine,PC,Apr-24-2013,Pocketwatch Games,Adventure | General | General,Quarter to Three,100,This is the second time in a month that I’ve been completely bowled over by an indie project that I’d never even heard of created by people whose games I’ve never played. I can think of no better indicators that no matter how bad SimCity turned out no matter how disappointing the gameplay in Bioshock Infinite no matter how familiar any Call of Duty no matter whether the next Xbox is always online it’s a perfect time to be into videogames.
Indigo Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Sep-26-2005,Quantic Dream,Adventure | Third-Person | Modern,Times Online,100,A completely engrossing game designed for the patience of adult players that will stand up to an almost infinite number of sessions. It’s a technically marvellous achievement by David Cage.

No Man's Sky Beyond,PlayStation 4,Aug-14-2019,Hello Games,Action Adventure | Open-World,Guardian,100,Sony has sold millions of its PlayStation VR headsets and until now it’s been tough to recommend one experience as a killer app. Soulful technically proficient and at times almost tearfully beautiful No Man’s Sky Beyond is as close as we’ll get.

Outland,PlayStation 3,Jun-14-2011,Housemarque,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D,1UP,91,You could easily fill an entire review with the grocery list of games from which Outland cribs its gameplay elements -- Ubisoft's own marketing specifically calls out Ikaruga and Prince of Persia as "inspirations" for heaven's sake. But doing so seems unnecessarily reductive to me because Outland manages to take those "inspirations" and create something that feels like genuine innovation.

GRIS,Switch,Dec-13-2018,Nomada Studio,Action | Platformer | 2D,Screen Rant,100,GRIS is best experienced as single-sitting five-hour adventure and after that there's nothing more to do really do with the game. The puzzles are a lot less engaging on repeat and the world is very linear. In every other aspect though GRIS is a masterpiece in visualization and atmospheric storytelling.
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,PlayStation 4,Nov-3-2014,Sledgehammer Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,IGN,91,This is a Call of Duty game to its core but one that rehashes as little as possible while still retaining its strengths.
