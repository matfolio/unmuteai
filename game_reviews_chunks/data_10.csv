Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink,Xbox One,Jan-22-2016,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object | General,TrueAchievements,80,Clockwork Tales: Of Glass and Ink will surprise many gamers. While genre aficionados might find the gameplay a bit too simple most will appreciate its accessibility.
Blood Bowl 2,Xbox One,Sep-22-2015,Cyanide,Sports | General | Team | Football | Arcade,Brash Games,80,Minor design hiccup aside Blood Bowl 2 is an otherwise resounding success that does enough to please fans of the board game while delivering enough in the way of exciting and accessible gameplay to make this a genuine option for those with no prior interest in the Warhammer brand.
Mercenaries Saga 2: Order Of The Silver Eagle,3DS,Jul-2-2015,RideonJapan |Inc. | Ride On,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,GameGrin,80,Considering my expectations weren’t high the game sat rather well with me and scratched my FF Advance Tactics itch which wasn’t satisfied with my gander at Blazing Souls: Accelate on the PSP. Whilst the game doesn’t have really any truly unique selling points it maintains itself as being a rather solid SRPG with the music and graphics to match these expectations.
Verdun,PC,Apr-28-2015,M2H | Blackmill Games,General | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Arcade,GameWatcher,90,Much like the conflict that the game shares its namesake with Verdun is a ferocious and tense multiplayer shooter the likes of which we haven’t seen in a long time.
Dungeons 2,PC,Apr-24-2015,Kalypso,Strategy | General,Gamer.nl,85,Dungeons 2 is a colorful strategy game like Dungeon Keeper. The charming style and the mix of running ominous dungeons and raiding the world makes Dungeons 2 a solid game. The terrible jokes during the campaign however do not do the atmosphere in this game good.
Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars,3DS,Mar-5-2015,Nintendo | Nintendo Software Technology,Puzzle | Action | Platformer | 2D,God is a Geek,90,A superb puzzle game that has the added bonus of being cross-buy.
Super Galaxy Squadron,PC,Jan-23-2015,Psyche Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,CGMagazine,85,Super Galaxy Squadron feels comfortingly like an arcade cabinet I might have once slipped a quarter into at the Pizza Hut down the road.
Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition,PlayStation 3,Jan-6-2015,Abstraction Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Compilation | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Dealspwn,80,Level design is still exceptional; expansive with a real sense of place.
Road Not Taken,PlayStation 4,Aug-5-2014,Spry Fox,Miscellaneous | General | Puzzle | Puzzle | General,Gamestyle,90,A wonderful Roguelike puzzle game that feel unique.
Inazuma Eleven 3: Team Ogre Attacks!,3DS,Feb-14-2014,Level 5,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Cubed3,80,Whilst this 3DS release is nothing more than a port of a DS game from Japan its charm and addictive gameplay cannot be argued against with the intriguing storyline and smart Touch Screen tactical football battles making this RPG-with-a-twist one to definitely check out.
BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode One,PC,Nov-12-2013,Irrational Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,games(TM),90,It’s an affectionately crafted homage to the first game retroactively building on the grim story and Ayn Rand-ian themes galvanising them with a fresh perspective whilst simultaneously tying Rapture more wholly into the Columbian narrative. It’s intelligent indulgent and nostalgic in equal measure left dangling on a transfixing narrative hook. It’s everything we love about BioShock condensed.
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate HD,PlayStation 3,Oct-29-2013,Mercury Steam,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Vandal,80,It feels limited some times something we can understand taking into account that it comes from a 3DS version. However if you’re a fan of the subseries created by MercurySteam and if you haven’t played before it’s a game you should play.
Disney DuckTales Remastered,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2013,WayForward,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Machinima,90,If you’re looking for a fun maddening and nostalgic romp through your 1980s childhood DuckTales: Remastered fits that bill.
Tekken Revolution,PlayStation 3,Jun-11-2013,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,80,It’s just like being back in the arcades (with lots of Japanese kids kicking your arse). [August 2013 p79]
Rogue Trooper: Quartz Zone Massacre,Wii,Dec-4-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Games Master UK,81,A ballsy shooter with great ideas all of which have been borrowed and done better elsewhere. [May 2009 p.69]

Need for Speed: Nitro,DS,Nov-2-2009,Firebrand Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,78,Need for Speed: Nitro isnt the best racer on the DS. Its not even the best goofy racer on the DS an honor that will probably always belong to the consoles iteration of Mario Kart. It is however a lot of fun to play.
Major League Baseball 2K8,Xbox 360,Mar-3-2008,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Planet Xbox 360,91,The game is an upgrade in every way from last years solid offering making this one fantastic title every baseball fan should check out.
Nobunaga's Ambition: Rise to Power,PlayStation 2,Feb-5-2008,Koei,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic,1UP,85,Real-time battles aside Rise to Power is a surprisingly good strategy game for the PS2. Its extremely steep learning curve will limit its appeal but its a rewarding experience for those with the patience to learn the games nuances. And with the sheer amount of replayability it offers you get a lot of bang for your buck.
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes,PSP,Aug-28-2007,Bandai | CyberConnect2,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Cheat Code Central,88,The play modes are all-new and the team concept is certainly an interesting addition to the gameplay. Not to mention the absolutely unique dichotomy between the Hero mode and the promotion test mode.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,Game Boy Advance,Jun-27-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action Adventure | Historic,AceGamez,80,A wonderful surprise for GBA owners and fans of the film looking to take the experience home.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue,GameCube,Oct-12-2004,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Worth Playing,85,One downside is that theres a heck of a lot here thats pulled together from other games if youre up on your gaming history you can play spot the element here and rattle off a good five or so games that do bits of Ty 2 better than Ty 2 does.
.hack//Quarantine Part 4,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2004,CyberConnect2,Role-Playing | Action RPG,netjak,90,If you’re only going to play one game in this franchise .hack//QUARANTINE is the one to get. A powerful plot (including the series’ conclusion) and access to most of the gameplay from the prior three games makes it the definitive title in the series.
Crash Nitro Kart,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Vicarious Visions,Driving | Racing | Kart,GamePro,90,While CNK may not break new ground it does a quality job of delivering another kart racer in Crash’s universe. It will put gamers mettle to the test and offer hours of wait one more time... gameplay.
Batman: Vengeance,GameCube,Nov-17-2001,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Fantasy,IGN,81,It is not a game without faults but its solid if formulaic gameplay mechanics and beautiful cartoon style combine for an experience that is definitely recommended.
Fuzion Frenzy,Xbox,Nov-14-2001,Blitz Games,Miscellaneous | Party,Media and Games Online Network,90,A great title...Its only good for playing with friends.
Wizards & Warriors,PC,Sep-27-2000,Heuristic Park,Role-Playing | General | General,IGN,84,Comes about as close to tabletop RPGing as any computer RPG weve ever played.
Lollipop Chainsaw,Xbox 360,Jun-12-2012,Grasshopper Manufacture,General | Action | General,Gaming Age,91,So basically Lollipop Chainsaw is a game thats certainly worth your time and money. The overall game on Normal is pretty short but theres a whole lot replay value packed into the experience that actually makes that short game time a lot more feasible than you might expect.
Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Jun-3-2008,High Moon Studios,Action | General | General,Armchair Empire,85,For a first attempt at an established franchise The Bourne Conspiracy makes good on its promises and gives us the chance to become the perfect weapon.
Skate It,Wii,Nov-19-2008,Electronic Arts,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,WonderwallWeb,95,This is a must have for any Wii owner and yet another reason to own a Wii Board. The best skater in the current gen.
Saints Row: The Third - The Full Package,Switch,May-10-2019,Fishlabs | Deep Silver,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gaming Age,100,It was one of my favourite games of the generation back when it first came out on PS3 and after sinking many many hours into this version I suspect it’ll wind up being one of my favourite games of whatever generation the Switch falls into too.
Neves,DS,Nov-6-2007,Yuke's | Yuke's Company of America,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Worth Playing,92,Neves has a simplistic elegance that is incredibly elusive in the gaming industry.
Halo Wars 2,PC,Feb-17-2017,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | General,The Escapist,90,Halo Wars 2 is the sequel that no-one really asked for but is a surprisingly solid traditional base-building RTS and is finally on a platform suited for the genre. The campaign is a little lacking but several different multiplayer modes and the promise of six months of regular updates make up for it.
Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars,Wii U,Mar-5-2015,Nintendo | Nintendo Software Technology,Puzzle | Action | Platformer | 2D,Cubed3,90,Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars is very reminiscent of Lemmings as the goal is to guide Mario and friends through levels by manipulating objects around them instead of directly controlling them. Creating inventive ways to avoid hazards and collect coins make each level a challenging but endearing experience.
Making History: The Calm and the Storm,PC,Mar-13-2007,Muzzy Lane Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | General,PC Gameworld,85,This game could help give people a better understanding of just how fragile the eco system of war is giving them a sense of realism that is not found in most other strategy games. Unfortunately its that same level of realism that might make this game unplayable for other gamers.
Steep: Road to the Olympics,PlayStation 4,Dec-5-2017,Ubisoft Annecy,Sports | Individual | Ski / Snowboard,The Games Machine,84,Road to Olympics is a sincere passionate and compelling love letter to the Olympic spirt. It’s not a proper game about Pyeongchang Winter Games but rather a Steep-style take on them with a fresh and intense game campaign an amazing new mountain to explore and a lot of challenges to take. If you loved Steep you’ll love this expansion even more.
Just Dance 2015,Xbox One,Oct-21-2014,Ubisoft,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Cheat Code Central,82,Just be forewarned—it took less than twenty minutes as a casual player to build up a sweat so make sure you plan your wardrobe and company accordingly.

DK: King of Swing,Game Boy Advance,Sep-19-2005,Paon Corporation,Action | Platformer | 2D,NintendoWorldReport,95,Its so good in fact that even if you stripped away the DK license and made it oh I dont know Ravens Thats SO Swinging youd still have a great game. Donkey Kong is just the icing on the cake. You want innovation but still want a full game? Its right here.
Block Breaker Deluxe,Wii,Jun-16-2008,Gameloft,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,Nintendo Gamer,80,Ignore all the neon 80s nonsense going on around it and this is a solid game. Theres plenty of it and it gets tough as old boots as well. [Sept 2008 p.68]
One Piece: Grand Adventure,GameCube,Aug-29-2006,Ganbarion,Action | Fighting | 3D,Cheat Code Central,88,The variety of modes the insane amount of unlockables and the sheer element of fun makes Grand Adventure a game not to be missed.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands,PlayStation 4,Mar-7-2017,Ubisoft Paris,Action Adventure | Open-World,Cheat Code Central,90,It’s quickly becoming my favorite first-person shooter of the year thanks to its impressive landscape captivating storyline and fully customizable characters. The short list of negatives pale in comparison its highlights. All and all Ghost Recon: Wildlands delivers and should easily be a contender for 2017’s best first-person shooter if not best game. It’s magnificent unique and certainly worth your time.
Tengami,Wii U,Nov-13-2014,Nyamyam,Adventure | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,Its the kind of experience that like Gone Home people will dismiss for lacking action or having a narrative that doesnt treat its players like idiots but its also the kind of game that shows that the games industry is growing up and pushing the limits of what can be achieved given the freedom and resources to be properly creative.
Thief,PC,Feb-25-2014,Nixxes Software,Fantasy | Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,IGN Italia,86,An excellent stealth game true to the spirit of the original and at the same time much more modern. Very polished gameplay and a clever difficulty level make Thief a game no stealth fan should miss. The plot and the setting arent always inspired but the quality of the content greatly makes up for it.
MySims,PC,Oct-28-2008,EA Redwood Shores,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,NZGamer,80,There is a very appealing quality to this game that I’m pleased to say far surpasses the DS offering.

[Oct 2008 p.76]
Killzone,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Guerrilla,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,AceGamez,100,Its graphically stunning the sound effects and music immerse you into a tense and exciting atmosphere of total chaos a strong story compels you through a long single player campaign full of variety and challenge against tough enemies and the fully online multiplayer mode can be played split screen with a bunch of bots for those without a network adapter.
Arca's Path VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Rebellion,Action | General,PlayStation Universe,90,Arca’s Path combines fun and accessible gameplay with an amazingly intuitive and inventive control scheme. What could have been a debacle is instead a triumph. Arca’s Path is a small game with giant ideas and it deserves attention and praise for the ridiculously high level at which it is executed.
The Swindle,PC,Jul-28-2015,Size Five Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Shacknews,80,Despite these issues I still love the game. It’s a brilliant look at what indie games should be and the unique Don’t Starve-like art style is right up my alley.
Sniper Elite V2,PlayStation 3,May-2-2012,Rebellion,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Digital Chumps,88,Often in spite of itself SEV2 is a really fun and captivating experience whether played solo or with a friend.
Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,PlayStation Vita,Nov-24-2015,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Gaming Age,91,Heres how much I love Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires: my only complaint is that theres no autosaving which meant I once lost about half a continent. I figure that any time my complaints can be totally chalked up to user error that speaks volumes about how good everything else is — and it explains why I think that if youre looking for one Warriors game that shows everything the franchise does well without getting bogged down by any of its weaknesses Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires is the one to get.
Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session!,PlayStation 4,Nov-2-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Rhythm | Music,Video Chums,81,Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session! is focused on what makes the franchise enjoyable: its distinct take on rhythm gameplay.

Stranger of Sword City,Xbox One,Mar-22-2016,Experience Inc.,Role-Playing | General,ICXM,85,As a fan of dungeon crawlers and JRPGs this is definitely a game that every fan of this genre should play.
Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2008,Blitz Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Xbox Achievements,85,A solid title from a company with years of experience making karaoke games with a very real possibility of a steady revenue stream for Konami if they handle the DLC well.
Luminous Arc,DS,Aug-14-2007,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Tactics,RPG Fan,85,While this game will not end gamers quest for an irreplaceable Nintendo DS RPG it can certainly entertain them for 15-20 hours.
Gekido Advance: Kintaro's Revenge,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2003,Naps Team,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,TotalGames.net,89,The backdrops too are marvellous and the ancient Japanese feeling is matched perfectly with a slow and unsettling score. Whenever you are ambushed this is quickly replaced with an adrenaline-inducing rush of beats and youll find yourself dragon-punching in rhythm to the music.
Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller Episode 4 - The Cain Killer,PC,Sep-19-2013,Phoenix Online Studios,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,RPG Fan,85,Erica Reed is an engaging character: flawed but good-hearted and learning as she goes along — much like the game named for her. This was a trip Im glad I went on and one I advise any fan of adventure games to take for a spin.
Lumino City,PC,Dec-2-2014,State of Play Games,Adventure | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),100,An interesting game from all points of view. It amuses even those people who are normally not interested in games at all. [Issue#249]
Road Redemption,PC,Oct-4-2017,Dark Seas Games,Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,DarkZero,90,Overall Road Redemption is a brilliantly fun spiritual successor to the Road Rash series and absolutely exceeded my expectations. Its exhilarating and surprisingly tactical gameplay compensate for lackluster visuals and a few environmental collision issues. Road Redemption is an absolute blast to play and I thoroughly recommend it.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,PSP,Nov-15-2005,Electronic Arts,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,80,The execution of the magic spells and the top notch presentation makes this game a definite buy for Harry Potter fans and for those gamers looking for a simply fun title to pop into their lonely PSP.
Cubixx HD,PlayStation 3,Sep-20-2011,Laughing Jackal,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,ZTGD,85,Considering what you get for the price Cubixx HD is a worthy investment that offers up tons of challenging game modes in a package that not only looks great but plays great as well.
WRC 7,PlayStation 4,Sep-15-2017,Kylotonn,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,God is a Geek,80,WRC 7 is undoubtedly 2017’s most exciting rally game held back only by an overall experience that makes the same mistakes as its predecessor.
60 Parsecs!,PC,Sep-18-2018,Robot Gentleman,Adventure | General,GamingTrend,85,60 Parsecs is a simple game about not dying in space. While not complex in gameplay 60 Parsecs is incredibly deep with strategy problem-solving and smart resource planning. The game expertly blends a cartoonish and goofy world with some of the darkest elements of death and isolation. 60 Parsecs is a surprisingly fantastic game that has a large amount of replay value. It’s well worth a look.
Dandara,PC,Feb-6-2018,Long Hat House,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Hardcore Gamer,80,Dandara‘s seemingly-impossible feat at combining elements of platforming combat and strategy within its explorative template takes some doing and is almost an accomplishment in of itself.
Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus,PC,Jun-1-2016,Tamsoft | Marvelous AQL,Action | General,DarkStation,80,Look past its sexy veneer and Shinovi Versus is a solid well made brawler with panache. Come for the boobs stay for the empowering battles against ninja hordes.
Abyss Odyssey,PlayStation 3,Jul-15-2014,ACE Team,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Linear,Digitally Downloaded,90,Abyss Odyssey is a thematically deep game. On the surface its a simple action platformer crossed with roguelike but under that surface is a true rarity; a game made by South Americans that rejoices in South American mythology.
Evochron Mercenary,PC,Sep-17-2010,StarWraith,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Combat,BigPond GameArena,90,The important thing is this: this is a game made not just by a fan of the genre but by somebody who understands when something is fun... and when it needs to be cut entirely.
Sonic Classic Collection,DS,Mar-2-2010,Creative Assembly,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Compilation | Compilation | 2D,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,83,Its not a great port and wed have liked more content but the quality gameplay shines through.

Buzz! Junior: Jungle Party,PlayStation 2,Oct-2-2007,Magenta Software,Miscellaneous | Trivia / Game Show,VideoGamer,80,It looks pretty simple but its got a cuteness that will appeal to a wide range of players and enough mini-games to keep players interested for a good while.
Mosaic,PC,Dec-5-2019,Krillbite Studio,Adventure | General,The Indie Game Website,90,Mosaic is a cold game in which you strive to find even a shred of warmth. It fills you with a desire to be better to talk deeply to yourself and reassess your values. It doesn’t feel like a game exactly but more of an experience in empathy. Full of quirky dark humour that for once doesn’t come in the form of cringy dialogue and enriched with concepts that could make even the most steeled among us weep Mosaic does the heart some good.
Strider,PlayStation 3,Feb-18-2014,Double Helix Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamingTrend,90,This is one of the those rare times when a game was just made right and while you have every right to love it or hate it it’d have nothing to do with how it was made. This is an 80’s videogame power-ballad that hits all the right notes.
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition,PlayStation 2,Feb-18-2004,Edge of Reality,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamePro,90,Wrap up the tight gameplay in gorgeous graphics and solid sounds and Pitfall has never been better. [May 2004 p.69]

The game doesnt however advance much once you get going.
Beat Hazard,PC,Apr-15-2010,ShadowRage,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,AtomicGamer,80,With some new social features online play or even some adjustments that more closely tie in the arrangement of enemies with the pace of the music Beat Hazards value could ascend well beyond the $10 asking price.
Mother Russia Bleeds,PC,Sep-5-2016,Le Cartel Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,God is a Geek,90,A debauchery-fueled beat ‘em up with plenty of ways to cripple your enemies its excessive violence never overshadows the smart and intuitive combat.
Beat Cop,Switch,Mar-5-2019,11 bit studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,COGconnected,84,I didn’t really have any expectations on Beat Cop when I first played it on PC back in 2017. Even two years later now on the Nintendo Switch it manages a quite pleasant surprise playing it. The story is quite addicting and I’m always eager to see what is next or even replay to see what else could have happened. Beat Cop is a pretty decent length as well and should clock in for most somewhere between seven and ten hours. The non-linear story along with the multiple endings means there is a good amount of replayability as well. All in all this is a great homage to 1980’s cop shows that shouldn’t be missed.
EA Sports UFC,Xbox One,Jun-17-2014,EA Sports,General | Sports | General | Individual | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,EGM,90,The best representation of the action that happens inside the Octagon yet. While it’s not simple the control scheme is still easy enough to learn that it takes the experience to an entirely new level as you break your opponents down standing up in the clinch or on the mat. With outstanding next-gen visuals EA Sports UFC is good enough to carry around a championship belt.
Democracy 3,PC,Oct-14-2013,Positech Games,Strategy | General | General,Gaming Nexus,88,The first glance at Democracy 3 can cause an immediate its too complicated reaction but the well-designed interface enables a fairly quick understanding of how to manage the policies required to create your own personal political utopia. For those that are into this kind of thing Democracy 3 is a great way to test pet political theories in a (mostly) consequence-free way.
SingStar ABBA,PlayStation 3,Dec-2-2008,SCEE London Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Playstation Official Magazine UK,90,In terms of doing what it says on the box SingStar Abba simply cant be faulted. [Jan 2009 p.99]
Anomaly Defenders,PC,May-29-2014,11 bit studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Sci-Fi | Defense,Softpedia,85,Anomaly Defenders is a good final hurrah for the tower defense series from 11 Bit Studios. It has gorgeous maps fun and hectic gameplay and a lot of strategic opportunities via the deployable powers and the complex tech tree.

Silent Hill HD Collection,PlayStation 3,Mar-20-2012,Hijinx Studios,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Horror | Compilation | Compilation,GamingXP,90,Brings back two of the very best horror games that have ever been published. The oppressive atmosphere of the games is as terrifying as ever and sadly so are the controls. James and Heather controls are just too clumsy. The graphics are much sharper and clearer now though Silent Hill 3 looks much better than its predecessor. The fact that there are new voice recordings is awesome because the synchronizations of the originals were pretty impersonal and static. All in all the collection is worth every cent though it is strange that Silent Hill and Silent Hill 4: The Room are missing.
Remember Me,Xbox 360,Jun-4-2013,DONTNOD Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Pelit (Finland),90,Remember Me is a technically accomplished and very stylish action adventure. The sci fi story about meaning of memories is interesting. [June 2013]
Graveyard Keeper,Xbox One,Aug-15-2018,Lazy Bear Games,Simulation | Action Adventure | Virtual | Open-World | Career,XboxAddict,85,Graveyard Keeper takes a proven but seldom used format of game and gives it the fresh twist that needs to feel wholly unique while not straying too far from the blueprints that would make it compelling. Maybe just maybe if you arent too attached to your yearly run through of Luigis Mansion or Resident Evil 4 for Halloween youll consider picking up Graveyard Keeper for something different. Or you could do it now... You should do it now.
Beyond: Two Souls,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2013,Quantic Dream,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person | Modern,Impulsegamer,100,Sure there are a few plot holes and clichéd moments in Beyond Two Souls but like Heavy Rain it may become one of your most memorable gaming experiences to date.
WWE Legends of WrestleMania,PlayStation 3,Mar-24-2009,Yuke's,Action | Sports | Fighting | Fighting | Individual | Wrestling | Combat | Wrestling,Worth Playing,88,Overall Legends of WrestleMania is the best romp through the WWE Ive had the pleasure of playing in years.
Crash of the Titans,PlayStation 2,Oct-4-2007,Radical Entertainment,Action | General,GamingTrend,84,It is commendable in a way since you know right from the outset that this is a game where you can just play. It is a lot of silly good natured fun that while not long in duration provides a good time.
Mercenary Kings,PlayStation 4,Apr-1-2014,Tribute Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical | Horizontal,Play UK,85,Deeper than it looks. [Issue#244 p.61]
Worms Battlegrounds,Xbox One,May-30-2014,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Artillery,ZTGD,95,I extremely enjoyed this game and it is definitely the best in the franchise that I have played. The story mode is brilliant and the new features and weapons improve the game play considerably. With online and offline multiplayer available too there is plenty of opportunity to play for hours. I was a little disappointed with the bugs that I encountered but in the end it did not take away from the fun of the game.
Ticket to Ride,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2008,Next Level Games,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,WonderwallWeb,89,I was very surprised at how good Ticket to Ride is and still go back to play it even after writing this review which is a rarity for me when it comes to Xbox Live games.
Cars,Xbox,Jun-6-2006,Rainbow Studios,Driving | Mission-based,WHAM! Gaming,90,What really leaves all the other modes in the proverbial dust though is the free-roaming aspect of Cars.
Wailing Heights,PC,Apr-27-2016,Outsider Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,GameSpew,80,So if you weren’t sure about the musical adventure genre you should be now. There may not be too much competition but Wailing Heights definitely belongs there as one of the genre’s greatest.
Pearl Harbor Trilogy - 1941: Red Sun Rising,Wii,Jul-5-2010,Arcade Moon,Action | Simulation | General | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,NintendoWorldReport,85,Red Sun Rising is one of the better WiiWare games released yet assuming you can adjust to the games awkward style of controls.
SimAnimals,DS,Jan-27-2009,Electronic Arts,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,WonderwallWeb,85,A surprise title that is hard to put down. It gets a bit samey later on but this is another great title aimed at the female market but worth a look for the blokes as well.
Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of WWII,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2007,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Games Master UK,79,Solid gameplay stunning aerial effects but nothing that will have you celebrating. [Oct 2007 p.82]
NFL Street 3,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,Armchair Empire,90,While EA will probably never make another Mutant League game of any sort NFL Street 3 ensures that the game of football can still be irreverent and entertaining at the same time.
Legacy of Kain: Defiance,PC,Dec-17-2003,Nixxes Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,IC-Games,90,A fantastic game that is let down slightly by an ill-designed camera system and lack of a map feature.
Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2007,Konami,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,GamesRadar+,80,Whats here is well polished and it works. Much like a favorite food the DDR series has settled into a comfortable groove. Perhaps the next outing will be a bit more daring.
The Council - Episode 2: Hide and Seek,PC,May-15-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,Game Debate,95,I lapped up all the skulking whispering skullduggery and a few of the plot twists caught me by surprise. I cant wait for more.
Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel,PlayStation 4,Feb-2-2016,Examu | Marvelous Inc.,Action | Fighting | 2D,Game Over Online,85,Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel is just the kind of well-crafted 2D fighter that the PS4 needs more of.
Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Apocalypse,Xbox 360,Aug-27-2013,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Arcade,Games Master UK,79,Origins a zombie-epic with giant robots rivals TranZit for thrills. [Dec 2013 p.63]
Fossil Fighters,DS,Aug-10-2009,RED Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | General,Worth Playing,92,The bottom line is that Fossil Fighters takes the formula established by games like Spectrobes and Pokemon and improves on it in nearly every way.
Sine Mora EX,Switch,Aug-8-2017,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,DarkStation,80,As a whole Sine Mora EX excellently interweaves the age-old time travel trope into both its complex paradoxical plot and unique time manipulation mechanics. And all seven levels are a spectacle hosting beautiful environments and impressive gigantic bosses. The ability to slow down bullet barrages combined with a fair checkpoint system makes it more approachable than others in the genre. Regardless most won’t get mileage outside of the main campaign which ultimately makes this a hard sell for anyone but enthusiasts. And although the Nintendo Switch edition has that trademark portability it’s tough to justify that higher price compared to other systems’ versions. Nonetheless it’s an exceptional experience that will offer hardcore shoot ‘em up fans a great time.
Citizens of Earth,PlayStation 4,Jan-20-2015,Eden Industries,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,90,As an adventure that does just about everything right in the fun and technical sense CoEs most valuable triumphs are its sense of humour and accessibility; whether you’re politically knowledgeable or oblivious and if you have a near-romantic relationship with turn-based RPGs you will risk yawning through a filibuster if it means becoming the Vice President of this world.
Call of Duty: Black Ops - Rezurrection,Xbox 360,Aug-23-2011,Treyarch,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,90,It seems that every new map pack gets progressively better or more interesting and a zombie-exclusive pack is a great way to keep Black Ops Zombie mode alive and kicking for a very long time while also giving fans who missed out on World At War a chance to experience that games incredible zombie offering.
Alice: Madness Returns,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2011,Spicy Horse,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamingExcellence,92,Alice: Madness Returns reminds me a lot of classic N64 platformers like Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie in the best of ways. By mixing a dark reimagining of a literary classic with stylish combat and rock-solid platforming EA and Spicy Horse have created a gaming experience quite unlike any other. At any rate its miles better than the lacklustre Tim Burton movie released last year. This is one rabbit hole worth tumbling down.
Batman: The Telltale Series - Episode 1: Realm of Shadows,PlayStation 4,Aug-2-2016,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,Gaming Age,100,Batman has had many games over the years mostly trash and a few quite memorable. Telltale Games has knocked it out of the park and if episode one is any indication I see a solid contender for Game of the Year right here.
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3,Xbox 360,Mar-5-2013,CyberConnect2,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,IGN,86,Ultimate Ninja Storms reputation as Narutos most consistently enjoyable game series is safe.
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,PlayStation 4,Jul-31-2018,iNK Stories,Adventure | General,Worth Playing,90,As a whole 1979 Revolution: Black Friday is a quick and blunt showing of an important piece of history thats made to be accessible to our generation. As a game the gameplay is straightforward but sometimes clunky the visuals are lackluster but portray what they must and the music bolsters the games chilling tone and narrative. There are some bugs in the visuals and longer load times but theyre minor hiccups when taking into account the games loftier goal of sharing this important piece of history with people who are largely unaware of it.
Warriors All-Stars,PlayStation 4,Aug-29-2017,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Digitally Downloaded,100,Warriors All-Stars is a delight. It’s explicitly a love letter to the Koei Tecmo faithful and it doesn’t pretend to be otherwise.
The Final Station,Xbox One,Sep-2-2016,tinyBuild | Do My Best Games,Action Adventure | General | Linear,Gaming Age,83,The Final Station doesn’t break any molds nor is it revolutionary in its gameplay or ideas but it is fun. It is good old fashioned quality fun.
Hydrophobia: Prophecy,PlayStation 3,Nov-1-2011,Dark Energy Digital,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,TheSixthAxis,90,Hydrophobia Prophecy on the PSN really is the best version. It looks and sounds great with water effects surpassing games with ten times the budget. Add in Move support that works well and a price of £5.10 and what we have is one of the PSNs best games.
Star Wars Galaxies: Episode III Rage of the Wookiees,PC,May-5-2005,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,GameZone,85,While those who have not taken to the Jump to Lightspeed expansion may feel a little forced to do so (and make sure you have the right ship) the game combines new missions that drive the story and give players a much better sense of being part of the Star Wars universe.
Puzzle Agent,PC,Jun-30-2010,Telltale Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,The A.V. Club,100,Nelson Tethers is also smart enough to mock itself for the frequency with which puzzles unnecessary crop up: The hotel owner doesnt see anything odd in the fact that her assistant wrote your room key down in code but Tethers roll his eyes before rolling up his sleeves and tackling another puzzle.
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy - Episode 1: Tangled Up in Blue,PC,Apr-18-2017,Telltale Games,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,DarkStation,90,With four episodes left and this episode ending with one hell of a mystery left to solve with a villain hot on their tales I am looking forward to picking up with the Guardians to see where adventure takes them. Consider my interest also peaked for finding out how they eventually work Thanos back into the mix. Until then we’re left with a wonderfully solid first chapter that leaves me with the hope that Telltale’s best is still to come.
Rocket Knight,PlayStation 3,May-18-2010,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Game Revolution,91,A game like this is exactly what I wanted in the classic remake trend. Sure it doesnt bring much thats new but it does expand on all that makes this genre great and even better it brings back the memories of great games from years past.
Atelier Annie: Alchemists of Sera Island,DS,Oct-27-2009,Gust,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GamingTrend,82,This is one of those pleasant surprises that sneaks up and grabs ahold of all your gaming time when you least expect it.
Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max'd,PlayStation 2,Sep-26-2006,Activision Value,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,TotalPlayStation,80,If youve played paintball in the past -- particularly in a tournament situation -- you may find even more to love here than most.
Tenchu: Shadow Assassins,Wii,Feb-5-2009,Acquire,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Gameplayer,90,Perhaps best of all though the developer has managed to create a graphically rich and detailed version of 13th Century Japan that’s positively dripping with atmosphere.
Metal Slug 7,DS,Nov-18-2008,SNK Playmore,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical | Horizontal,Game Chronicles,88,Metal Slug games tend to disappear fast and never return so snag this one fast and don’t be sluggish. If you see a sale bite and don’t hesitate.
Inazuma Eleven 3: Lightning Bolt,3DS,Sep-27-2013,Level 5,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Eurogamer Spain,90,The amount of content that Level-5 offers in this game is enormous and can last you for months.
Cars,PSP,Jun-6-2006,Locomotive Games,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Cheat Code Central,88,The racing gameplay is straightforward and although there are unlockables there isnt enough to increase the replay value score. The wireless multi-player mode will be the games only salvation in terms of replay value.
Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate,PlayStation 4,Feb-14-2020,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Player 2,83,There is quite frankly an overwhelming amount of content in Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate – while those upgrading from the base game may find it difficult to justify the cost outside of Infinity Mode there’s no question that anybody tossing up between the base Orochi 4 and Ultimate at this point should absolutely go with the latter.
Killer7,PlayStation 2,Jul-7-2005,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action Adventure | Modern,Play Magazine,90,Vile and bizarre refreshing and absorbing Killer7 is an aggressive blessing to cleanse us from the masses. [July 2005 p.70]

NCAA College Football 2K3,Xbox,Aug-13-2002,Avalanche Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GameSpy,80,Its a solid game but with EAs NCAA Football 2003 in stores theres no need to pick it up.
Strategic Command: European Theater,PC,Jul-16-2002,Fury Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,PC Gamer,90,Its the best grand strategy game since the 1993 classic Clash of Steel. [Nov 2002 p.138]

Project IGI: I'm Going In,PC,Dec-15-2000,Innerloop,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,GamePro,90,If you enjoy the idea of engaging covert-ops missions that require stealth and smarts more than sheer brawn youll love IGI.
F1 Championship Season 2000,PC,Nov-30-2000,Image Space Incorporated,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Formula One | Formula One | Automobile,Armchair Empire,94,A gateway game. It’s friendly enough for first time players but it’s got all the things to keep you playing and become a hardcore racer. (It’s even got options to show you the best trajectory and supply driving tips.) But even the hardcore simmer will find F1RC a challenge and realistic.
Dragon Ball: Origins 2,DS,Jun-22-2010,Game Republic,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,3DJuegos,82,A must-own for Dragon Ball fans.
Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers,PlayStation 4,Jan-31-2017,Omega Force,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Digitally Downloaded,100,Even as a dedicated single player game Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers is one of the best games available on the platform. It’s just so perfectly balanced invigorating intelligent and rich.
Game of Thrones: Episode Six - The Ice Dragon,PC,Nov-17-2015,Telltale Games,Action | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,Ragequit.gr,93,A brilliantly climactic finale that also sees Telltale taking a bold step forward in terms of gameplay by offering a substantially different playing experience dependent on player choice. If this is a foreshadowing of things to come Telltale is bound to remain firmly upon the interactive movie throne.
Starpoint Gemini 2,PC,Sep-6-2013,Little Green Men,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | General,GamingTrend,90,Starpoint Gemini 2 is a beast of a game. It gracefully balances exploration action narrative and RPG elements to create a complete package that thrills and excites… most of the time. Be aware that the nature of the missions are repetititive and ultimately a means to an end: to become the most powerful captain in the galaxy.
SingStar Pop Vol. 2,PlayStation 2,Sep-23-2008,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,PGNx Media,88,If you have a PlayStation 3 it may be better to pick up SingStar for PS3 since that game includes an online community where you can upload videos and download new songs. SingStar Pop Vol. 2 doesn’t include any of those features but as a multiplayer game it’s recommended as long as you like the songs.
Outbuddies DX,Switch,Jun-5-2020,Julian Laufer,Action | Platformer | 2D,GamingTrend,95,Outbuddies DX is the quintessential perfect game regardless of how you cut it. From the music that sets the tone and ramps up in the heat of battle to the many weapons available and the iconic and memorable boss battles it’s clear that years of development Outbuddies DX has gone through will revolutionize the Metroidvania genre.
140,Switch,Jan-9-2020,Jeppe Carlsen,Action | Platformer | 2D,Switch Player,80,140 is a rhythm-based platformer in which the player controls a geometric shape as it travels through two-dimensional levels that shift in time to the underlying soundtrack. A joy to play the game is a masterclass in rhythm-based game design.
Vandal Hearts: Flames of Judgment,PlayStation 3,Jan-21-2010,Hijinx Studios,Role-Playing | Strategy | Turn-Based | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Tactics,Play UK,87,Its not the prettiest game on PSN but its certainly one of the best strategy titles currently available. [Issue#192 p.97]
Vampyr,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,DONTNOD Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,90,Vampyr is the vampire story that I’ve waited for many many years for.

Tom Clancy's HAWX 2,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,XGN,85,If youre on the lookout for a great flight game look no further. H.A.W.X. 2 is the best game of its kind and will keep you wannabe pilots busy for weeks to come.
Falcon Age,PlayStation 4,Apr-9-2019,Outerloop Games,Action Adventure | General,PlayStation Universe,90,Falcon Age is a unique and charming game that is equally as impressive on the PS4 as it is on PSVR. The game features a cute falcon that you can share first bumps with in virtual reality but also features fun gameplay and a story with an important message.
Garfield's Nightmare,DS,Sep-4-2007,Shin'en,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gaming Nexus,81,Nothing about it is spectacular but it’s such a fun little platformer that I enjoyed it anyway.
Lips: Number One Hits,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2009,iNiS,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,AceGamez,90,Youll jump youll sing youll pelvic thrust like youve never pelvic thrusted before and eventually youll probably trip over and hurt yourself.
MotoGP 09/10,PlayStation 3,Mar-23-2010,Monumental Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,VideoGamer,90,If you dont have a big interest in bikes or MotoGP this isnt for you. Theres nothing here for casual bike fans or anyone who might be on the look out for something accessible in the bike racing genre. Its an incredibly solid package though and one that fans will get a lot out of.
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3,Xbox 360,Oct-22-2006,Digital Eclipse,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,PGNx Media,89,Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is just as addicting as it was several years ago. The game is definitely worth its 800 Microsoft Points ($10) cost since you can move online once you get tired of beating your friends.
The Whispered World,PC,Apr-26-2010,Daedalic Entertainment,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Just Adventure,91,The Whispered World is about half a terrific game and half a mess. But since the most important parts the puzzling graphics and exploring are all well done Im going to ignore the stuff I cared less for and award the game an overall grade of A minus.
NCAA Basketball 09,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,TeamXbox,81,The revamped NCAA Basketball 09 does a nice job of giving bracketheads what they want despite some freshman jitters with its new engine. Even though NCAA Basketball 09 may not be a Final Four lock it’s clear that the franchise has a winning road ahead of it.
Below,Xbox One,Dec-14-2018,Capy Games,General | Action | General,CGMagazine,90,Below is a punishing dungeon crawler mixing elements from roguelikes Dark Souls and survival games to create an often painful yet oddly enticing action-adventure game.
Homefront,Xbox 360,Mar-15-2011,Kaos Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,XboxAddict,93,Combining so many elements into such a cohesive story THQ has reminded me why I love gaming. The only fault I could find other than the character models was the relatively short single player campaign; on the hard level I finished the game in less than 7 hours.
Tembo the Badass Elephant,Xbox One,Jul-21-2015,Game Freak,Action Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,90,Tembo the Badass Elephant is easily one of the most memorable releases of 2015 and hopefully the beautiful beginning of Game Freak branching out from Pokemon (and Nintendo) to deliver more pleasant surprises.
America's Army: Rise of a Soldier,Xbox,Nov-17-2005,Secret Level,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,Yahoo!,90,We can think of few shooters that capture so well the dynamics of modern combat. And we can think of even fewer that have managed to stand out with such a unique and compelling approach.
Virtua Tennis 2009,PlayStation 3,Jun-9-2009,Sumo Digital,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,Vandal,85,Virtua Tennis 2009 is still a great tennis game and it arrives at the right moment far enough from the last installment for sports fans to want a little more of Virtua Tennis. The only thing to criticize is the few changes in comparison with the last game.
Section 8: Prejudice,PlayStation 3,Jul-26-2011,TimeGate Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameWatcher,90,Its not perfect but we highly recommend this title to all FPS fans looking for something fresh to bide the time.
Top Spin 2,PC,Mar-16-2007,Aspyr | 2K Sports,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,PC Gamer UK,80,This is a big tight game thats just lacking in greatness or spark. [Feb 2007 p.78]
Rainbow Moon,PlayStation 3,Jul-10-2012,SideQuest Studios,Role-Playing | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,Impulsegamer,92,Overall I was very surprised with how much fun Rainbow Moon was and would highly recommend any fans of RPGs to buy the game. If you have fifteen dollars you will find there is no better way to spend your money if you dont Id recommend saving up to buy this game.
Fe,Xbox One,Feb-16-2018,Zoink!,Action | General,Digital Trends,90,Players who aren’t willing to relax a bit and let Fe take some control of their experience might have trouble but most everyone else will find an affecting unique romp through the woods backed by touching moments and some of the most inventive design to come from a major publisher in ages.
Coffee Talk,PlayStation 4,Jan-30-2020,Toge Productions,Adventure | Visual Novel,Digitally Downloaded,80,None of the characters or situations in Coffee Talk are simple or black-and-white. Rather the world is a beautiful complicated shade of grey. People arent good or bad theyre just trying to do their best. The message is hopeful. The pace is soothing. The music is well-suited to the environment. Coffee Talk really delivers on all fronts and even offers more game time post-story. Now its time for me to return to my customers I think the orc has arrived...
AER: Memories of Old,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2017,Daedalic Entertainment,Action Adventure | General | Open-World,Everyeye.it,82,Its curious to see how a handful of brains and so much passion can create such graceful creatures.

Shadow Blade: Reload,PC,Aug-10-2015,Dead Mage Studio | Dead Mage,Action | General,Brash Games,90,It is very easy to get into no matter how much or how little you play platformers. It is a game that you will want to replay over and over.
Before the Echo,PC,Oct-20-2011,Iridium Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Bit-Gamer,100,Play Sequence well and youll fall into Zen bliss forgetting all your problems and applauding yourself after every victory. Fumble and youll swear in grunts hating yourself until you get it right. Perseverance is hard but worthwhile.
Little League World Series Baseball 2008,Wii,Aug-5-2008,Now Production,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Arcade | Arcade,GameShark,83,If the game only had a little more depth and online play it would be easy to recommend this without question. As it is it’s right up there with Power Pros as one of the more enjoyable Wii experiences you can have in a baseball game.
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,Xbox,Nov-10-2004,Activision,Action | Platformer | 3D,XGP Gaming,85,Most of the game is presented in the standard 3-D platformer presentation. However when players must rely on the talents of little Sunny the game shifts its perspective to that of an old-school 2-D side scroller.
Shadow Warrior,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,Flying Wild Hog,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Impulsegamer,85,Shadow Warrior on PS4 is a brilliant homage to what make the 90s video gaming world so entertaining!
Fairy Tail,PC,Jul-29-2020,Gust,Role-Playing | General,PC Invasion,80,A lot of anime games are full of personality but lack refinement and polish. Fairy Tail undermines those expectations by being well made whilst still capturing what made the original manga so special. Newcomers may find the limited retelling of the plot hard to follow but franchise veterans should have a blast.
Romancing SaGa 2,Switch,Dec-15-2017,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,80,This is one of the more unheralded Super Nintendo JRPGs but the update is of a high quality and while I don’t think it’s a classic example of the genre by any means it is still a very enjoyable game. A clean enjoyable combat system plenty of enemies to fight and a bit of exploration and puzzle solving on the side; this is the kind of classic JRPG experience that I’ll never get tired of.
Rainbow Moon,PlayStation 4,Feb-16-2016,SideQuest Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,4Players.de,83,New hardware same old game. But that is not necessarily bad. Story and characters could be more elaborate but classic turn based tactics drawn in appealing visuals is still as good as it always was.
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2,Xbox 360,Feb-25-2014,Mercury Steam,Fantasy | Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,Official Xbox Magazine,85,With a 20-hour runtime both it and the gameplay are prone to meandering and missteps but Lords of Shadow 2 nonetheless manages to bring the series crashing to a satisfying conclusion. [April 2014 p.70]
The Godfather: The Don's Edition,PlayStation 3,Mar-20-2007,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic | Open-World,GameZone,82,This is one of the strongest versions of the game without a doubt coupling a dynamic character creation system with deeper gameplay.
Cities XL 2011,PC,Oct-14-2010,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,My Gamer,88,Considering many of the missteps that the newer SimCity games have taken I am more than happy to say that Cities XL is more than able to contain the mantle of spiritual successor.
Sudden Strike 4,PC,Aug-11-2017,Kite Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Hooked Gamers,88,As my first entry into the series Sudden Strike 4 is one of those RTS games that Ill actually remember a year from now. One where Ill be sitting there and go Jeeze I think its about time to play it again. Im halfway tempted to go back and check out the older games but Sudden Strike 4s campaign is just something sublime that Im going to be revisiting frequently when I get the RTS itch. The shame is that I didnt enjoy the multiplayer as much as the single-player as while the gameplay mechanics stay intact it loses a lot of that luster. A final note: the campaign being only 21 missions along with the less enjoyable multiplayer may not be enough for many people to pay out the $49.99 price tag. Its a bit steep but I still say its a must play for any RTS fan.
CIMA: The Enemy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-17-2003,Neverland,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Nintendo Power,86,Hard-core RPG fans will enjoy the games nonlinear depth and detail. [Nov 2003 p.152]

Elefunk,PlayStation 3,Jul-17-2008,8bit Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Gamer.nl,80,Elefunk is a puzzle game with which both architects and normal gamers will have much fun. The building of bridges needs insight but are never impossible to solve. More levels would have been nice and we also had some trouble with framedrops. Anyway this game is well done.

The Angry Birds Movie 2 VR: Under Pressure,PlayStation 4,Aug-6-2019,XR Games,Puzzle | Action,GamingTrend,85,With simple asymmetric gameplay this game is great for kids of all ages and a worthy tie-in to the movie. While the unskippable trailer is a poke in the eye there’s nothing better than the cackling of a five year old while he mercilessly throws his would-be helpers around a submarine full of bombs.
Lost Planet: Extreme Condition Colonies Edition,PC,May-27-2008,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,80,There are plenty of new features that will entice fans back to the fold including new maps characters and single-player and online modes.

The Sims 4,PC,Sep-2-2014,Maxis,Virtual Life | Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual | Virtual Life,Vandal,90,Everything feels like a step forward even though there are some aspects (like random tutorials or some situations in which we felt completely out of control) that we would like to see more polished. Still a great choice for The Sims fans.
Assassin's Creed Unity,PlayStation 4,Nov-11-2014,Ubisoft | Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Historic | Open-World,PlayStation LifeStyle,100,Unity doesn’t just play well it looks beautiful too.

Pinball Hall of Fame - The Gottlieb Collection,Xbox,Nov-18-2004,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Pinball,Cheat Code Central,80,For a budget game it certainly is worth the price. While it can get very challenging at times the way the game feels and switches for each table is fantastic.

Tarantino would be proud.
Maid of Sker,PC,Jul-28-2020,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action Adventure | Survival,Hooked Gamers,90,Maid of Sker doesn’t have terribly complex gameplay but it’s a tightly-made game that succeeds in more than enough areas to make it worth checking out. The Sker hotel is haunting filled with detail and character that makes it a joy to explore. The choral soundtrack is absolutely beautiful befitting both the game’s plot and atmosphere. Horror fans have been absolutely spoiled with high quality games over the last few years and genre fans would do well to add Maid of Sker to their list of must-plays.
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy - Episode 2: Under Pressure,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,Telltale Games,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,COGconnected,82,This episode has a good flow and tempo with lots of visually appealing cutscenes and action to break up the story and while it reaches the end without feeling rushed the cliffhanger feels a bit out of place.
Star Wars Battlefront: Outer Rim,PlayStation 4,Apr-5-2016,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Gameblog.fr,80,Outer Rim is an honest DLC offering beautiful cards a new and fun way and some attractive novelties. For holders of season-pass it is a very good opportunity to do it again. Indeed the content does not necessarily justify the 14.99 & euro;. Unless you are a big fan of Greedo or Nien Nunb. Its up to you.
Retrovirus,PC,Jan-31-2013,Cadenza,Action | Miscellaneous | General | General | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,DarkStation,80,Retrovirus is a great adventure and it gives you some insight into what your computer could be dealing with each day you use it.

To significantly mark off this title right now would be if youll pardon the pun merely a matter of timing.
Prince of Persia: Rival Swords,Wii,Apr-3-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,88,If you havent played the Two Thrones and enjoy platforming mixed with fighting and puzzles dont miss this game; its a true masterpiece.

Homefront,PC,Mar-14-2011,Digital Extremes,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,88,I love this game and despite a few forgivable flaws Homefront is easily one of the most immersive and emotional campaigns that come to mind in my 30 years of gaming. Sure the campaign is short. Deal with it. With that ending there is either going to be a sequel or some killer DLC. Meanwhile you can reap the rewards and satisfaction of some of the best multiplayer combat weve seen so far in 2011.
The Moment of Silence,PC,Mar-1-2005,House of Tales,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Four Fat Chicks,100,One of the best adventure games of 2004 and likely the best ever to deal with a futuristic Orwellian theme of corruption and conspiracy. Story dialogue character development settings artwork acting and music are all superb.
Vampyr,Xbox One,Jun-5-2018,DONTNOD Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Xbox Tavern,88,Vampyr is an ambitious experience that’s packed with atmosphere and personality.

Tricky Towers,Xbox One,Sep-15-2017,WeirdBeard,Puzzle | Stacking,XboxAddict,75,Multiplayer is where Tricky Tower shines causing some hilarity at the best of times and anger directed towards your friends the other times. Sure you’ll get frustrated now and then as it’s sometimes hard to recover from a misplaced block but that’s where the challenge comes for this game. Tricky Tower is quite tricky to get the hang of as it takes some time learning and remembering the ‘half’ moves the blocks make and that these same blocks aren’t locked in place once they land. At the end of the day Tricky Towers can be an enjoyable experience especially if you’re craving some Tetris-like gameplay with a unique twist.
Pix the Cat,Xbox One,Feb-8-2017,Pasta Games,Action | Arcade,TheXboxHub,90,On the whole though and Pix the Cat is nothing short of adorable arriving with some of the best features ideas and supremely high production levels that can be found in an indie title. You may well initially think that both the Laboratory and Nostalgia modes are just tacked on extras to ensure more game time is thrown in but in fact you would be massively wrong with both modes more than capable of holding their own in the vast wilderness of the independent games scene.
Disney Universe,PlayStation 3,Oct-25-2011,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,82,The fun platforming inspired level design and bevy of character suits all make this a game worth experiencing.

Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit,Xbox,Sep-29-2005,Frontier Developments,Action Adventure | Modern,Times Online,80,Park and his teams creative modelling skills make the films magical but in replacing them with computer graphics this game delivers pretty average fare. That said its cartoon visuals and helpful prompts should keep younger children amused for hours.
Game of Thrones: Episode Three - The Sword in the Darkness,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2015,Telltale Games,Action | Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,PSX-Sense.nl,85,The third episode makes up for the dull second with eventful additions to each of the four major stories.

The Fall Part 2: Unbound,Switch,Feb-13-2018,Over The Moon,Action Adventure | General,Switch Brasil,85,The Fall Part 2: Unbound is the best Puzzle game ever launched in the Switch eShop so far. Bringing such a good story makes the price paid worth it. The graphics are not ugly but it is also nothing special worth noting that it is visible the difference from portable to TV mode. The game is still divided into other genres which avoids repetition. The gameplay has minor issues with the characters targeting system but nothing that interferes too greatly with the gaming experience. It is highly recommended for fans of puzzles and a good story and can entertain you for several hours.

Heroes of Might and Magic V: Tribes of the East,PC,Oct-16-2007,Nival Interactive,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Pelit (Finland),83,A decent expansion to a good series. Innovative setting or exciting plot has not been Nival’s strong side previously and Tribes of the East is not an exception. It however is more enjoyable gaming for the warlord who hasn’t yet got his fill of the original game with familiar mechanics and a few new additions to make it feel fresh enough. Some scenarios feel a bit too restrictive at times a trait familiar from the earlier games too but not so much as to take much fun out of the game. Addition of campaign editor is good news but how the community makes use of it remains to be seen. [Jan 2008]

Alice: Madness Returns,PlayStation 3,Jun-14-2011,Spicy Horse,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamingExcellence,92,Alice: Madness Returns reminds me a lot of classic N64 platformers like Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie in the best of ways. By mixing a dark reimagining of a literary classic with stylish combat and rock-solid platforming EA and Spicy Horse have created a gaming experience quite unlike any other. At any rate its miles better than the lacklustre Tim Burton movie released last year. This is one rabbit hole worth tumbling down.

ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove,Xbox One,Mar-1-2019,Humanature Studios,Action | General,ZTGD,90,This game helped me understand why people love the original ToeJam & Earl so much. Back in the Groove basically renders the original obsolete. I would recommend it to any fan of the original and to anyone who wants a unique and less action packed game to play even more so if you have friends to play with. It will be exciting to see what’s next for the funk duo and their friends.

Mr. Shifty,PC,Apr-13-2017,Team Shifty,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameGrin,80,Mr Shifty is a hectic brawler that is enjoyable in short bursts. You can happily power through a few stages and feel like a badass while you’re doing it. It is however a short experience but there are enough challenges variety and enjoyment to be had. In contrast to Hotline Miami’s brutal difficulty you’d think Mr Shifty would be Hotline-lite but you’d be far from wrong as it can stand tall as being one of best top-down brawlers.
Richard & Alice,PC,Feb-21-2013,Denby / Raze,General | Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,80,Anybody interested in games with a narrative focus simply must give Richard & Alice a shot.
X-Men: The Arcade Game,Xbox 360,Dec-15-2010,Konami,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Planet Xbox 360,84,Its another dose of Konami arcade goodness with up to six players taking part in the over-the-top comic book action.

World War II: Frontline Command,PC,Jun-27-2003,The Bitmap Brothers,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General,Gamers' Temple,90,It was definitely interesting to play a game that to some extent had the look and feel of an Age of Empires yet with game play focused on mission accomplishment as opposed to strategic planning (i.e. no need to develop your trade economy or make sure you have enough lumber to build houses).
ATV Quad Power Racing 2,GameCube,Jan-22-2003,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Armchair Empire,86,Replicating speed is always a goal for racing games and ATV 2 meets the challenge. Fast is fast especially with the better ATV’s and the blurring effect during boost use really does bring that sense of speed home.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger,PlayStation 2,Sep-10-2002,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,PSM Magazine,80,The variety in its environments is quite high and the large number of mission objectives will certainly challenge you for countless hours.

The Punisher (2005),Xbox,Jan-17-2005,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Maxim Online,100,Its not all brutality. The Punisher is also one of the most immersive strategy games ever created. Aim for the head and enjoy.
Ironclad Tactics,PC,Sep-18-2013,Zachtronics Industries,Strategy | General | General,IGN Italia,85,As the title suggests Ironclad Tactics scope is not huge but what it lacks in quantity it definitely makes up in quality.

Genesis Alpha One,Xbox One,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Xbox Tavern,90,Genesis Alpha One is a tremendous roguelike that rarely holds back. Its many systems are well balanced its plethora of unique objectives remain fresh and its random generation solidifies its already impressive variation. There’s room for minor improvements and there’s some slight visual blemishes across the entire board but this takes little away from the constant uncertainty that the game relays at a tense and frequent rate.
Flame Over,PlayStation Vita,Mar-10-2015,Laughing Jackal,Simulation | General | Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gamestyle,90,A fine entry into the Roguelike genre just don’t be fooled by its cutesy visuals this game is brutal.
City of Brass,PC,May-4-2018,Uppercut Games Pty Ltd,Action Adventure | General,Game Informer,78,Uppercut Games’ first roguelite is a strong entry in the crowded rogue-lite genre thanks to its amusing thievery-based brand of creativity.

World Gone Sour,Xbox 360,Apr-11-2012,Playbrains,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,ZTGD,87,All in all for five dollars you can easily have a fun time with World Gone Sour. Sure it is a glorified commercial for Sour Patch Kids but that doesnt stop it from being rather enjoyable. Its a competent little platformer that you and a friend on the couch can enjoy. The style is great and the narrator is legitimately funny at times. Give it a shot.
Blair Witch,PC,Aug-30-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,GameGrin,90,In all Bloober Team has done a great job of capturing the feel and ethos of the film series.

A few issues stop it from being perfect but it certainly does justice to a film that’s held dear to many.
The Secrets of Da Vinci: The Forbidden Manuscript,PC,Jun-7-2006,Kheops Studio,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,100,I had a wonderful time pretending to be a medieval snoop and I think that other gamers will too.

Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix,GameCube,Oct-24-2005,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,Cheat Code Central,90,A great value. If you like to visit the Mushroom Kingdom look silly playing a videogame and wish to get in shape rush out to your local game shop and pick up a copy.
Fortified,Xbox One,Feb-3-2016,Clapfoot Inc.,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gaming Age,91,All in all I’m pretty impressed with Fortified.

Monster House,Game Boy Advance,Jul-18-2006,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Horror,eToychest,87,For fans of action role-playing games especially those who enjoyed the source material Monster House offers a reasonable amount of value.

Speed Racer,Wii,May-6-2008,Sidhe Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Drag | Futuristic | Drag,GameShark,91,It is unfortunate that the movie performed as poorly as it did as the game is one of the better arcade-style racing games that have come out in a long time.
Final Fantasy Explorers,3DS,Jan-26-2016,Racjin,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,90,With the superb Final Fantasy heritage to support it and even compensate for the lack of narrative context as well as some truly exciting multiplayer questing this is a game I have a lot of time for and will do so for a long time to come.
Pure Farming 2018,PC,Mar-13-2018,Ice Flames,Simulation | Virtual | Career,PLAY! Zine,75,Its always heartwarming to see a new addition in the Farm Sim genre that offers evolving expanding and rewarding experience.

Archangel,PlayStation 4,Jul-18-2017,Skydance Interactive,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,COGconnected,91,The final battle in Archangel is one of the coolest most epic experiences I’ve had yet in VR.

Transformers Animated: The Game,DS,Oct-21-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PGNx Media,80,Ultimately Transformers Animated: The Game works by delivering classic platforming gameplay and getting the feel of the series down.
Song of the Deep,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Insomniac Games,Action Adventure | General,CGMagazine,95,Song of the Deep is also a great game. Its spunky protagonist had me rooting for her until the heartwarming conclusion and I didn’t want to leave the game’s enthralling world. It’s one of the most original titles of this year and certainly one of the most fully realized.
Age of Empires: Definitive Edition,PC,Feb-20-2018,Microsoft Game Studios | Forgotten Empires LLC,Strategy | Real-Time | Command,Windows Central,90,The performance was solid throughout my testing I had no issues with gameplay improvements and the graphics looked great. There were some pathfinding issues and units did enjoy clashing with one another which made battle rather hectic but the clunky controls and movement were among the things I loved most about the original.
Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis,PlayStation 2,Apr-1-2008,Gust,Role-Playing | General,RPG Fan,90,Mana Khemia is an incredibly fun game with a fairly large scope that takes a minimum of 40 hours to complete.

SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,PC,Jun-23-2020,Purple Lamp Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Hooked Gamers,84,In all SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated is a welcome return for those entering Bikini Bottom again and an enjoyable journey for those visiting for the first time. Although there is a touch of nostalgia in revisiting the game for me the additions that Rehydrated brings makes it a delightful game with plenty of heart and fun.
Battleborn,PC,May-3-2016,Gearbox Software,Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Arcade,GamingTrend,90,Battleborn merges cooperative and competitive hero and shooter loot and shoot into an excellent melting pot and symbol of the times. Charismatic characters clever intricacies and compelling gameplay make this one of the best multiplayer experiences of the generation yet.
Hitman HD Enhanced Collection,PlayStation 4,Jan-11-2019,IO Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Cubed3,80,Both Hitman: Blood Money and Hitman: Absolution are a stealth gamers delight and a decent addition to the PS4s growing catalogue of classics. Veterans and newcomers alike will find something to enjoy in this diverse pairing but the over-the-top price tag is likely to discourage many who are on the fence. Nevertheless the remastering is good and both titles play well on the system even though there are no major graphical changes over the originals beyond a resolution bump and some minor interface tweaks.
Disco Dodgeball Remix,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Zen Studios,Sports | Team | Futuristic,GameSpace,85,A fun and competitive multiplayer game.
Korix,PlayStation 4,Mar-29-2017,StellarVR,Strategy | Real-Time | General,IGN Italia,82,A fascinating mix of RTS and tower defense that uses the VR in a smart way and provides a level of challenge far from trivial.

Cars Mater-National Championship,DS,Oct-29-2007,Rainbow Studios,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,Digital Entertainment News,84,If you can have only one racing game on the DS get Mario Kart DS. However after that you’d do well to check out Pixar’s Cars: Mater-National Championship.
Driver: Parallel Lines,PlayStation 2,Mar-14-2006,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Mission-based,AceGamez,90,Its a compelling tale which is more than backed up by some fly graphics cool soundtracks and smooth gameplay.
Disney's Cinderella: Magical Dreams,Game Boy Advance,Sep-20-2005,Culture Brain,Action | Platformer | 2D,WHAM! Gaming,90,Disney has all the bases covered and then some to keep a childs interest as they work their way through an assortment of diverse levels.

Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization,PlayStation 4,Nov-8-2016,Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | Action RPG,XGN,85,Sword Art Online Hollow Realization is an almost perfect imitation of an MMO. The game feels like one but is more JRPG than MMO. There is tons of stuff to do in a massive world. And it is lots of fun for fans but also for newcomers to the franchise.
Absolver,PlayStation 4,Aug-29-2017,Sloclap,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Worth Playing,90,In my opinion Absolver is in the upper echelon of recent releases but it still has a few issues. The camera can work against you at the most inopportune times like when youre cornered but thats more bearable to me than the motion blur. Other than those complaints the game slows down its offerings after a dozen hours or so unless youre playing co-op with friends. On the plus side theres supposed to be free DLC in the future and it seems like a pretty solid promise. Given Absolvers $30 price tag you cant really complain about this purchase.
Magical Starsign,DS,Oct-23-2006,Brownie Brown,Role-Playing | General | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,RPG Fan,83,Magical Starsign does an excellent job at taking the classic Turn-Based RPG formula and turning it into something fun for Nintendos new handheld device.

God Eater 2: Rage Burst,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Shift,Role-Playing | Action RPG,NZGamer,82,Deep and rewarding.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue,Xbox,Oct-12-2004,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Xbox Nation Magazine,80,Rescue very nearly outclasses every other cutesy platformer on Xbox. [Nov 2004 p.90]
Wings of War,PC,Aug-30-2004,Silver Wish Games,Simulation | Flight | WWI | WWI | Combat,Gamezilla!,90,Online play I might mention is excellent. Though currently sparsely populated Wings of War servers tend to draw dogfight specialists so your chances of getting more skilled when fighting online is very good.
Neighbors from Hell,PC,Sep-22-2003,JoWooD Entertainment AG,Strategy | General | General,Gamer's Hell,90,While this may be short it is great fun.
IndyCar Series,PlayStation 2,May-21-2003,Codemasters,Driving | Racing | Formula One,IGN,85,The challenge level is great the dicing through traffic is adrenalin inducing (I had to force myself to release my death grip on the controller a few times) and the focus required to play is high. It just feels real.
The Sum of All Fears,Game Boy Advance,Nov-19-2002,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Nintendophiles,85,In my opinion ANY game that actually makes you want to see the movie and even read the books is a good one and that game did just that.
Outlaw Golf,GameCube,Oct-29-2002,Hypnotix,Sports | Traditional | Golf | Arcade,Game Over Online,80,With loose but logical controls humorous gameplay and more ways to stroke than… I’ll stop the punch line right there there are kids reading.
Spring Break,PC,Sep-10-2002,Deep Red,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Business / Tycoon,Yahoo!,80,With only the occasional shark attack and violent thunderstorm disrupting the tranquillity of island life the game doesnt have the same pace or urgency as say Theme Hospital or Theme Park but the task of setting-up and running grand holiday resorts is challenging enough to keep you engrossed for many an hour.
Crazy Taxi,GameCube,Nov-17-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Arcade,GameZone,90,One of the best video games ever made.
Trade Empires,PC,Sep-17-2001,Frog City Software,Strategy | General | General,IGN,83,A fine entertaining game. You will find yourself playing the missions for many hours and repeating them to use different strategies.
Sudden Strike,PC,Jan-23-2001,Fireglow,Strategy | General | General,TotalGames.net,93,If you love real-time strategy but are getting a little bored of tank rushes and linear opposition then you should snap this up as soon as you can – it’s worth every penny and then some.
Duck Dodgers Starring Daffy Duck,Nintendo 64,Sep-16-2000,Paradigm Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,CNET Gamecenter,80,Paradigm has done an excellent job of re-creating a cartoon universe with colorful characters hilarious animation and eye-popping visuals that are fun for all ages.

NCAA GameBreaker 2001,PlayStation,Aug-21-2000,989 Sports,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GameSpot,82,Basically the same as last years model.
Alien Breed: Evolution,Xbox 360,Dec-16-2009,Team17,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,Planet Xbox 360,85,While the game certainly wasnt without flaws I found them to be a bit more forgivable given the overwhelming amounts of fun I was having with the game.
The Inner Friend,Xbox One,Apr-28-2020,Playmind,Action Adventure | General,Xbox Tavern,80,The Inner Friend is creepy abstract touching and something that will get under your skin. There’s a story here that is relatable yet presented in a way that captures the exaggerated-ness of a child’s imagination. Movement is a little fiddly and it’s all over quickly but the experience is still one that will stick with us for some time yet.
Mercenary Kings: Reloaded Edition,Switch,Feb-6-2018,Tribute Games,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,CGMagazine,90,It may just be nostalgia but for its price Mercenary Kings Reloaded feels like a perfectly fair package.
We Were Here Too,PC,Feb-2-2018,Total Mayhem Games,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Gamer.nl,75,We Were Here Too is a cool co-op puzzle game that challenges you to escape from a room by communicating well. Many puzzles feel the same so the replay value of this game is not very high.
Warhammer 40000: Sanctus Reach,PC,Jan-19-2017,Strayllight Entertainment,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Meristation,80,Sanctus Reach is a classic turn-based strategy game full of good ideas and with a high number of campaigns that guarantee many hours of entertainment.

Nightmares from the Deep 2: The Siren's Call,Xbox One,Aug-26-2016,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object | General,TrueAchievements,80,The hidden object and puzzle gameplay is solid and is only let-down by the clunky mahjong controls. However the story is an enjoyable romp across a cursed island. If its one thing that Artifex Mundi fans have learned its that you never go anywhere on a dark and stormy night when there is no shortage of supernatural threats.
Deadlight: Director's Cut,Xbox One,Jun-21-2016,Tequila Works,Action | Platformer | 2D,Official Xbox Magazine UK,80,An excellent action puzzle platformer but unnecessary if you have it on Xbox 360. [Sept 2016 p.76]
Fruit Ninja Kinect 2,Xbox One,Mar-18-2015,Halfbrick Studios,General | Action | Arcade,IGN Spain,80,Chopping fruit has never been this fun. Fruit Ninja Kinect makes everything better including more mini-games and allowing up to 4 people to enjoy the party.

Broken Sword 5: The Serpents' Curse - Part I,PC,Dec-4-2013,Revolution Software,General | Adventure | General,DarkStation,90,In its current form The Serpent’s Curse is half finished.

Section 8,Xbox 360,Sep-1-2009,TimeGate Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Age,83,All the little things that game incorporates into combat like the drop ship spawning the customizable load outs the base control with automated defenses and the various modules keep Section 8 from being a bland multiplayer shooter and help it stand out against the pack of Halos and Call of Dutys that currently populate the system.
NBA Ballers: Rebound,PSP,May-9-2006,Backbone Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade | Arcade,eToychest,82,A good arcade-style basketball game to pass the time. Just keep in mind that the loading is atrocious.
Black & White 2 - Battle of the Gods,PC,Apr-24-2006,Lionhead Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,AceGamez,90,The addition of more creatures gives it more depth and will keep you amused that little bit longer plus the plot is amusing and explores the darker side of Eden what with the undead running around all over the place and everything.

Mayan Death Robots,PC,Nov-20-2015,Sileni Studios,Strategy | General,CGMagazine,90,The real marvel of Mayan Death Robots is that it’s the first game of its type that I don’t feel is an incomplete experience if you don’t have friends to play it with.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands,PC,Mar-6-2017,Ubisoft Paris,Action Adventure | Open-World,Ragequit.gr,92,Ghost Recon Wildlands does not really innovate. However it offers enjoyable tactical stealth gameplay set in an impressive vast world and provides a fun memorable and rewarding experience in both co-op and solo playthroughs. Main missions are well-designed and offer great variety and challenge and although the story is rather predictable it has great presentation and ample amounts of information to support it. It is in its core a true Tom Clancy title and worthy successor to the Ghost Recon series.
Murasaki Baby,PlayStation Vita,Sep-16-2014,Ovosonico,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Action | Platformer | 2D,PSNStores,90,This might not be something that I go back to often but it’s left me satisfied in a way that not many games do.

Magicka 2,PC,May-26-2015,Pieces Interactive,Fantasy | Action Adventure | General,Cheat Code Central,86,Magicka 2 doesnt mess much with the formula of the first title. If the hours you spent traipsing through Midgård before grew tedious the sequel may not wield enough magic to hold your attention. However if you dropped the first game quickly due to the plethora of game breaking launch bugs or missed this gem of series altogether it is more than worth your time for an excellently priced $15.
Magician's Quest: Mysterious Times,DS,May-11-2009,Konami | Aquria,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,VideoGamer,80,Despite the fact that it is clearly being marketed at children Enchanted Folk is a surprisingly deep game. Fans of Animal Crossing may feel that this is a little too similar for its own good but other young gamers should have plenty of fun with their magical studies. The slow pace wont be for everyone but kids who do like this will probably play it for a long time.
Enchanted Arms,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,From Software,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | General | Japanese-Style,Gaming Age,91,With the Japanese dialog the stunning visuals and the solid turn-based combat system its the first game in a long time that sates my appetite for the old school RPG.

The Sun and Moon,Xbox One,Jan-27-2017,Digerati Distribution,Action | Platformer | 2D,TheXboxHub,90,I love this game. I may not have completed it chances are I’m going to struggle with a few of the stages for days weeks and months on end and I’ve more or less given up even trying to pick up half moon full moon and full sun rewards but the overall sense of achievement that The Sun and Moon gives in just the bog standard completion of a stage is enough of a reason for me to keep playing.

Rebel Cops,PC,Sep-17-2019,Weappy Studio,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,GameGrin,80,All in all Rebel Cops is a blast to play and feels like a great modification to the This Is The Police formula.

4x4 EVO 2,PC,Oct-30-2001,Terminal Reality,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,GameZone,98,This game comes as close to the real 4 wheeling mud slinging rock climbing log jumping experience as you can get without actually climbing into a real 4X4.

Under Siege,PlayStation 3,Jun-2-2011,Seed Studios | Lda,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Impulsegamer,85,Overall the game is definitely worth the price and will provide some good entertainment. Hardcore RTS fans wont find the game to be very good unless they look at it as a new type of game as opposed to an RTS and casual gamers will find they can play and enjoy the game even without being fans of RTSs. As such the game fits a nice niche along with an amazing price. If a person can look past a few flaws then they should find an enjoyable game for a low price.

The Golf Club 2,Xbox One,Jun-27-2017,HB Studios Multimedia | Maximum Games,Sports | Individual | Golf | Arcade,XboxAddict,80,Despite some of the drawbacks The Golf Club 2 is right now the elite golf experience on the Xbox platform. With EA having a tough time with their golf game HB Studios simply crushed it with The Golf Club 2. Its going to seem frustrating aggravating (especially putting) and at times it will test the durability of an Xbox Elite controller but all of that stress anguish and turmoil melts away instantly when you unlock the achievement of getting a hole-in-one from over 250+ yards (I literally jumped up yelling and cheering when I hit it). Then its back to normal and I ended up getting a bogey on the next hole. One thing is for certain and thats The Golf Game 2 will take you on a ride of emotions. Is it worth $39.99 plus tax? Without a doubt it is.

Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure,3DS,Jun-11-2015,Nintendo,Puzzle | Stacking,NF Magazine,85,Even though it misses a few chances to do more Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure is still the best version of this classic puzzler so far. [Issue #16 – July/August 2015 p.21]
AER: Memories of Old,PC,Oct-25-2017,Daedalic Entertainment | Forgotten Key,Action Adventure | General | Open-World,GameGrin,80,Featuring a stunning low-poly art style a wonderfully well-integrated soundtrack an ingeniously simple control scheme an interesting transformation mechanic and impressively designed temples AER has a lot going for it. It’s unfortunate that the experience is as short as it is and there is no way to keep track of what’s been seen. A few more environmental puzzles and a simple journal would fix my only complaints about this exploration-heavy title.
Graveyard Keeper,PC,Aug-15-2018,Lazy Bear Games,Simulation | Action Adventure | Virtual | Open-World | Career,Jeuxvideo.com,75,Beside its evident qualities in terms of immersion due to a funny unique and charming context Graveyard Keeperand lacks variety and is sometimes too much based on farming system.
Wet,Xbox 360,Sep-15-2009,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Armchair Empire,88,There never seemed to be alternate routes to take; theres one way to go and thats it.
The Blackout Club,Xbox One,Jul-30-2019,Question,Action Adventure | Survival,Xbox Tavern,77,So to some up The Blackout Club is a Fun addictive 4 player co-op horror with a Stranger Things atmosphere and lots of paranormal paranoia. Fans of the genre will dive for this and its nice to see a brave new attempt at the horror game. With the new enhanced horror system being a plus I can see people are going to be very curious about this title.
Cycle 28,Switch,Aug-2-2018,Pill Bug Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Switch Player,80,Despite the fairly limited upgrades and occasional flaws there’s plenty of enjoyment to be found in Cycle 28. Its fast-paced addictive gameplay will keep you coming back again and again and again… Needless to say the name is apt.
DOOM VFR,PC,Nov-30-2017,id Software,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Arcade,VRFocus,100,Ultimately DOOM VFR stands as a fine example of just what can be achieved with the FPS genre in VR as of today lining-up against Robo Recall as an action-heavy experience that throws the rulebook out of the window. It’s true that the visual quality has suffered dramatically and the control systems could be seen as far too awkward by many but the fact that DOOM VFR pushes so hard against the VR grain makes it well worth any PlayStation VR owner’s time and money.
The Simpsons Arcade Game,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2012,None,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Eurogamer Germany,80,If such an arcade-cabinet had existed near my home 20 years ago my parents would still be paying off the debts I would have accumulated by feeding it quarters. Even if you take into account the shortcomings The Simpsons Arcade is along Turtles in Time as one of the best Beat em ups out there.
Harvest Moon: Magical Melody,Wii,Aug-25-2009,Marvelous Entertainment,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Management | Breeding/Constructing | Business / Tycoon,IGN UK,80,Its soothing compulsive and peculiarly thrilling all at once: a perfect little world where working hard brings its own tangible rewards and cows have huge happy faces. Even in this slightly butchered state its good to see Magical Melody finally on these shores.

The Conduit,Wii,Jun-23-2009,High Voltage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,91,The Conduit is a flawed masterpiece: it doesn’t quite live up to the nigh-unreachable hype built up around it but by breaking so much ground on the Wii it does something more important than meet the hype.
Erica,PlayStation 4,Aug-19-2019,Flavourworks,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Gaming Nexus,85,Erica tells a boilerplate story—but tells it very well. With a fresh intuitive interface and some of the best production values and acting ever seen in a video game Erica feels very much like what it aspires to be—an interactive film. Erica is perhaps an odd experiment but one well worth experiencing for gamers that enjoy trips off the beaten path.
NHL 2K9,Xbox 360,Sep-8-2008,Visual Concepts,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,Planet Xbox 360,82,The best online addition this year is the Team-Up feature something all sports games should have going forward.
DESYNC,PC,Feb-28-2017,Foregone,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GamingTrend,85,An immensely tough but amazingly satisfying shooter experience for only $15 (USD).

HoopWorld,Wii,Jul-19-2010,Virtual Toys,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade | Arcade,IGN,80,Its a truly impressive alternative to the Jam experience that even excels beyond my nostalgia memories of that arcade classic in some respects.

The Haunted Mansion,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,High Voltage Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,Just Adventure,83,While The Haunted Mansion can not be classified as a children’s game it does have a genial yet spooky feel about it and is easily accessible by both novice and veteran gamers.

Castlevania Chronicles,PlayStation,Oct-8-2001,Konami,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cinescape,83,Its only too bad that a few extras couldnt be included. I would have loved to have a couple of the NES sequels on the disc. Also all the technical aspects (graphics sound) are dated (as they should be).
Xtreme Sports,Dreamcast,Nov-27-2000,Innerloop,Sports | Alternative | Other,Hot Games,80,If not for the xtreme difficulty of the game this would be one of the best titles of the year. Its still a landmark in terms of graphics.
