Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Konami,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,Console Monster,39,The Bemani series is like a vampire that just wont die. However much Konami drives a stake through its heart with extremely poor graphics and un-original gameplay which literally bleed it dry.
Genesis Alpha One,PlayStation 4,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,DualShockers,45,Gathering the necessary resources to fulfill a Genesis mission can take a lot of time especially if you end up getting pushed back by hostile invasions. There is a base sense of joy to be had from making the numbers go up but I never completed a Genesis mission and I doubt whatever feeling or reward it gives was worth the effort to reach it. I think it is more than enough to say I have no interest in playing more of it just to confirm what I already know: it’s not great.
Dr. Luigi,Wii U,Dec-31-2013,Arika | Nintendo,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,NowGamer,40,Dr Luigi is a solid example of the Tetris-like puzzler but doesnt do anywhere near enough to justify the price of admission.
Armored Core 4,Xbox 360,Mar-20-2007,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,1UP,40,AC4 feels like a house thats been added onto so often that its a maze of twisting passages oddly shaped rooms and doors that go nowhere. There may be something worthwhile hidden within but its not worth the effort to find it. Time to tear it all down and start over.
Kill la Kill: IF,Switch,Jul-26-2019,Studio TRIGGER | Aplus,Action Adventure | General | Action | Fighting | 3D,Cubed3,50,Kill la Kill the Game: IF has fun gameplay and a very appealing visual style but it is let down by its inaccessible story mode and lack of content to incentivise prolonged play. The small cast of characters is forgivable because of how unique and fun each one is to play but its difficult to justify buying this at the full retail price when it runs so light on content. Nevertheless the fanservice and unmistakable Kill la Kill flair is likely to delight fans but aside from a few amusing unlockables in the gallery mode there is little to sustain them beyond playing online.
NASCAR 09,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2008,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Stock Car | Stock Car | Automobile,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,Another below-par racer that makes turning left every five seconds exactly as exhilarating as it sounds. [Sept 2008 p.103]
Mazes of Fate,Game Boy Advance,Dec-6-2006,Sabarasa Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Digital Entertainment News,40,You can find better RPGs for the GBA period. Its something of a diamond in the rough its just a bit too rough to recommend.
198X,Switch,Jan-23-2020,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,Metro GameCentral,50,A mawkish attempt to glorify the 80s that features some gorgeous visuals and music but offers no real insight into the era’s culture or games.
SingStar Celebration,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,PLAY! Zine,30,Singstar wants to be karaoke for PS4 but with its very limited song list on the disk and a huge paid DLC library you would do best to find a different karaoke solution. Think YouTube.
Pro Cycling Manager Season 2013: Le Tour de France - 100th Edition,PC,Jun-20-2013,Cyanide,Alternative | Biking | Sports | Individual | Biking,Gamer.nl,40,A new Tour de France a new Pro Cycling Manager 2013. It almost seems to be a copy of the previous game. And a copy of the one that came out before that with the footnote that it has a few very nasty bugs. Hopefully Cyanide understands that they will have to go all out next year.
Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor - Martyr,PlayStation 4,Aug-23-2018,Maximum Games,Strategy | Real-Time | General,GameSpew,50,If you’re dedicated to Warhammer 40000’s world you may get some joy out of this but Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor – Martyr is anything but to-die-for.
The Baconing,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Gaming Age,33,It certainly feels like this game was made to hit a deadline rather than grow the franchise. I couldnt help but think it was a money-grab title.
Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo,Wii,Oct-20-2009,Media Vision,Action | Adventure | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Games Master UK,40,Can we have it this simple but a bit bigger? [Dec 2009 p.87]
Heavy Weapon: Atomic Tank,PlayStation 3,Jun-11-2009,PopCap,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,PS3bloggen.se,50,This is a perfect time killing game. It is simple and relatively minimalistic yet strangely entertaining if you overlook its core gameplay. Heavy Weapon was originally designed for the web and it shows as it utilizes very little of the power the PS3 has to offer. Sadly the web is really where this game belongs not on a cutting edge gaming machine. Save your money pal.
Skelattack,PlayStation 4,Jun-2-2020,Ukuza,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN Spain,50,Skelattack is a game with good ideas but poor execiution. The mechanics are flawed and originality doesnt exist. However the art saves the dishes a bit and offers some charisma.
Fragments of Him,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Sassybot,Adventure | Visual Novel,Gameblog.fr,50,Fragments of Him feels like an incomplete package a short and quite disappointing experience that fails to go satisfyingly deeper in its character development and to move us.
Tears to Tiara II: Heir of the Overlord,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2014,Aqua Plus,Real-Time | Fantasy | Strategy | Adventure | Turn-Based | Visual Novel | General,CalmDownTom,40,The more that a tactics game relies on story than gameplay the more it betrays a lack of self-confidence in the ability of its mechanics to sell the game. It’s the equivalent of an 80s B-Movie that is selling you on its cover art alone.
Band Hero,DS,Nov-3-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GamePro,40,As for the game itself I like to call it Band Hero: Abridged. The set list is varied fun and up to date with tunes from Avril Lavigne to The Rolling Stones. However without a career mode you have access to all 30 songs from the start.
Aven Colony,PC,Jul-25-2017,Mothership Entertainment,Strategy | Management | Government,Polygon,50,I spent the equivalent of a working week playing Aven Colony and it was hard labor. This is a game of relentless concentration and chore-work with only the briefest flashes of magic and relief offering almost nothing new to the city building or resource management genres.
Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe,3DS,Aug-29-2014,HAL Labs,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Impulsegamer,40,Unfortunately Drum Dash Deluxe is neither deep nor long enough to be worth the $7 asking price it stands at currently.
Antigraviator,PC,Jun-6-2018,Iceberg Interactive,Racing | Arcade | Futuristic,4Players.de,33,This is more a tech demo than a coherent game - stay away until it is fixed.
Obscure,PlayStation 2,Apr-6-2005,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,40,Maneuvering and combat are both very clumsy and the whole game leaves you wondering about the choices the game designers made. [June 2005 p.95]
How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition,PlayStation 4,Nov-4-2014,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Horror | Survival,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,55,Fun in small doses with a mate otherwise monotonous ugly and done better elsewhere. [January 2015 p82]
Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes,Wii,Oct-12-2010,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,GameSpot,45,Shallow mindless hack-and-slash action makes this a crushingly tedious slog through an anachronistic version of 16th-century Japan.
Bee Movie Game,PlayStation 2,Oct-30-2007,Beenox,Action | General,GamesRadar+,50,Dont force us to play the minigames to expand the already-uninspiring campaign. Its sloppy game design and it drags Bee Movie Game even further into the mud.
Crash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2007,Radical Entertainment,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,A loose kids game that could do with some titaning up. [Dec 2007 p.90]
NHL 08,PC,Sep-11-2007,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Ice Hockey | Sim | Sim,PC Gamer,35,EA Sports has once again screwed PC owners over with a cut-rate edition of one of its big fall sports games and NHL 08 is even more of a disappointment than its football and golf comrades. [Holiday 2007 p.83]
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,40,At certain points you simply feel total frustration - you just wanna stop playing sometimes. Of course youre better off never starting at all. [Dec 2003 p.162]
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PC,Nov-15-2001,KnowWonder,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,55,Underwhelms with an extremely brief story overly simplistic platform jumping sequences and repetitive gameplay...Suitable only for children.
Stretch Panic,PlayStation 2,Aug-28-2001,Treasure,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSX Nation,30,Control is atrocious characters extremely odd and unappealing IMHO (your mileage may vary on this one) rewards for your trouble very minimal graphics/sounds very underwhelming.
Off-Road Redneck Racing,PC,May-2-2001,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Yahoo!,40,Its saving grace might have been the potential it had to provide a more jovial spirit in the Redneck Rampage theme but this is never really accomplished.
Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition,Dreamcast,Oct-28-2000,Climax Entertainment,Driving | Mission-based,Da Gameboyz,48,None of these elements can make up for the sloppy control that destroys any attempt at fun.
Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour,Dreamcast,Jul-19-2000,Crystal Dynamics,Driving | Racing | Kart,Sega X,34,Its one thing to have poor track design but its another thing to leave out Mickey and Donald rip-off of others and allow the game to suffer from slow-down.
Afro Samurai,PlayStation 3,Jan-27-2009,Namco Bandai Games America | Namco Bandai Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpy,40,Afro Samurai is a mess of a game. Its such a shame to see such a beautifully rendered and stylish world ground into the dust by such staggering gameplay foibles and technical glitches.
Brothers in Arms: D-Day,PSP,Dec-5-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Pocket Gamer UK,50,D-Days strategic undertones are welcome but overall the game is too drawn out and generally lacking in tension to truly captivate other than in short sporadic bursts.
Lovely Planet,Xbox One,Jan-8-2016,QUICKTEQUILA,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,TrueAchievements,50,If youre in search of a game to play pass the controller with in a group of shooter-loving friends Lovely Planet may be worth checking out but is otherwise easily worth a pass.
Mini Ninjas Adventures,Xbox 360,Jun-29-2012,Side Kick LTD,Action | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,50,Gets very repetitive. [Issue#88 p.83]
Powerstar Golf,Xbox One,Nov-22-2013,Zoe Mode,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade,Games Master UK,40,Not new-gen material. [Jan 2014 p.63]
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,Xbox 360,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,52,Distinctly underwhelming. [Christmas 2011 p.106]
Dead Space 2: Severed,PlayStation 3,Mar-1-2011,Visceral Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamerNode,40,Severed places an ungainly weight on the shoulders of dismemberment combat for this extension of Dead Space: Extractions fiction creating a dichotomy as uncomfortable as traipsing backwards through already tired levels.
Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli,Wii,Aug-26-2008,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Other | Other | GT / Street | Automobile,HellBored,49,Frustrating boring and ordinary ... three words that should not be associated with Ferrari.
Just Cause 4,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Slant Magazine,40,It doesnt matter how cool an individual set piece looks if all the smaller scenes leading up to it are marred by unresponsive vehicles dumb AI and shoddy physics.
Tekken Hybrid,PlayStation 3,Nov-22-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,GameShark,25,I honestly dont know why anyone would buy Tekken Hybrid. If you love Tekken Tag Tournament theres no reason to drop $40 on this head scratcher when theres a likely superior current sequel in the cards that will offer the online play and other mod cons that this remaster doesnt. The prologue should have been a free download.
Brave: The Video Game,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,Disney Interactive Studios,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Linear,Digital Spy,40,Though not without its charms the mediocre gameplay and unambitious level design makes Brave feel more like a downloadable release than a fully-fledged retail title.
Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code,PSP,Mar-28-2006,Sony Online Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,PSW Magazine UK,30,The online mode featuring co-op play and deathmatches for up to three other players almost salvages the game but the sheer tedium of the rest of it sinks it.
Skully,Switch,Aug-4-2020,Finish Line Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamer Escape,30,I always feel a little bad being hard on a game. I know some people put a lot of work into this and they may even be proud of it but the simple truth of the matter is I did not have fun. I didn’t even feel the satisfaction of overcoming a challenge. Whenever I thought I’d find something I enjoyed the NPCs would snipe insults at each other and make me feel awkward about being around them.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2,PlayStation Vita,Aug-18-2015,Frima Studio,Horror | Action Adventure | Survival,IGN Italia,50,A good game ruined by a flawed conversion. If possible it’s better to buy it for another platform.
Farming Simulator 2013,PC,Oct-25-2012,Giants Software,Miscellaneous | General | Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,PC PowerPlay,50,This gets three bonus points for being less snooty than Agricultural Simulator 2012 which clearly has some kind of underdog issue. [Dec 2012 p.84]
Warhammer: Mark of Chaos - Battle March,PC,Sep-2-2008,Black Hole Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Informer,50,While the controls arent as big a deal on the PC the spotty AI poor pacing and lack of depth doom both versions. [Nov 2008 p.118]
Crayola Treasure Adventures,DS,Oct-1-2007,Crave,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,DarkZero,40,There is fun to be had here for children who are particularly fond of colouring and puzzles but if they’re that keen you can get the real thing for a tiny fraction of the cost of this (as well as being able to look at your work later) and so there’s little reason to buy Crayola Treasure Adventures.
Delta Force: Xtreme,PC,Apr-22-2005,NovaLogic,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Format,42,Pointless in the xtreme unless youre interested in war game archaeoogy. [July 2005 p.97]
Battleship,Xbox One,Aug-2-2016,Frima Studio,Miscellaneous | Board / Card Game,Stevivor,40,The entire point of Battleship is that you are face to face with your opponent and cannot see their ship layout. Relying on good sportsmanship not to peek is an unnecessary complication. In all honesty I think this game makes more sense on a portable device or mobile phone both for convenience and the basic logic of the game itself. Even at around $20 AUD it doesn’t seem worth the expense for a new mode alone.
Depth,PC,Nov-3-2014,Digital Confectioners,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,SpazioGames,50,Depth is certainly a game with an interesting idea but developed in a rather rough manner leaving more than a doubt not only on the production value but also on the idea of the asymmetric gameplay which is apparently riding the wave of enthusiasm born with Evolve.
Titan Quest,Switch,Jul-31-2018,THQ Nordic,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Trusted Reviews,40,Ultimately this is a 12-year-old game and no amount of spit and polish can overcome the dated mechanics and repetitive combat that lies at its core.
James Bond 007: Blood Stone,PlayStation 3,Nov-2-2010,Bizarre Creations,Action | Driving | Shooter | Mission-based | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,RealGamer,40,Blood Stone is definitely not one of 007s best missions.
ZEN Pinball 2: Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron,PlayStation 4,Apr-22-2015,Zen Studios,Action | Pinball,GamingTrend,45,Zen Pinball 2’s Age of Ultron table doesn’t offer enough fan service to appease any level of Avengers fan and there aren’t enough interesting mechanics to excite a virtual pinball fan.
Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave Incident,Wii,Jun-29-2011,Sanzaru Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Hidden Object | Puzzle | General,Gamekult,40,Quotation forthcoming.
Zombie Panic in Wonderland,Wii,May-3-2010,Akaoni Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,The A.V. Club,25,Couple the weaksauce tools with the pushover undead and you have a game that is decidedly not a panic.
Daemonica,PC,Mar-31-2006,Cinemax | RA Images,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,PC Gamer UK,41,An average idea made even worse by the poor execution. [Aug 2006 p.81]
Fallout 3: Mothership Zeta,Xbox 360,Aug-3-2009,Bethesda Softworks,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,GameCritics,35,If Mothership Zeta had been half as long and available at half the price it might have been worthwhile simply for giving players a quick peek behind the origins of the main games enigmatic alien wreckage. As it stands this dog-leg jaunt into outer space ends up a giant could-have-been without any real reason to recommend it save completion for completions sake.
Urban Trial Tricky,Switch,Jun-25-2020,Tate Multimedia,Sports | Individual | Biking,Jeuxvideo.com,35,Quotation forthcoming.
Dead or School,Switch,Mar-13-2020,Studio Nanafushi,Action Adventure | General,Switch Player,30,Dead or School often intrigues in appearance but never quite capitalises on the unique blend of the mundane. Technical issues bog down the core experience and the lack of restriction or respect for the rest of the content sours what could have been a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the underground.
Conarium,PlayStation 4,Feb-12-2019,Zoetrope Interactive,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,4Players.de,60,The foundation sounds promising but storytelling as well as puzzle mechanics lack suspense challenge and dynamics.
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,PC,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Romania,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,Computer Games Magazine,40,Toss in s shoddy padlock system that provides dramatic views of your plane but tends to throw off your aim completely and you end up with an arcade game thats more difficult to play than a full-blown simulation. [July 2006 p.63]
Serious Sam: Next Encounter,PlayStation 2,Apr-22-2004,Climax Group,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Thunderbolt,30,The game is a real mess with shoddy graphics a badly constructed and executed plot repetitive and flawed gameplay bland multiplayer elements and a serious lack of atmosphere.
Naval Ops: Commander,PlayStation 2,Mar-9-2004,Micro Cabin,Simulation | Ship,G4 TV,40,If youve played Warship Gunner youll probably have seen it all before from a more interesting on-deck perspective.
Conflict: Desert Storm II - Back to Baghdad,PC,Oct-7-2003,Pivotal Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,Computer Games Magazine,30,One of those half-baked ports of a console game that someone figured might squeeze a few bucks out of PC owners. [Feb 2004 p.77]
Disciples II: Servants of the Dark,PC,Jun-30-2003,Strategy First,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpy,50,Theres just not enough new content to justify this expansion.
Worms Blast,GameCube,Oct-24-2002,Team17,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,Nintendophiles,50,One boring and frustrating game... The controls and sheer monotony simply ruin the game.
Mega Man X6,PlayStation,Dec-4-2001,Capcom,Action | Platformer | 2D,XenGamers,16,The once fresh and inviting Megaman franchise has grown putrid.
ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2001,Konami,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,PSX Nation,50,ESPN NFL Primetime 2002 just barely is ready for Primetime.
Tetris Worlds,Game Boy Advance,Sep-5-2001,3d6 Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Stacking,GameSpot,21,Tetris Worlds does what countless iterations of the game havent managed to do in the past--it actually breaks Tetris.
Razor Freestyle Scooter,PlayStation,Dec-11-2000,Shaba Games,Action | General,Game Revolution,42,As bad as this game is young scooter fans will eat it up. After all its got a monopoly on the scooter game market and is really simple to understand.
Gunman Chronicles,PC,Nov-19-2000,Rewolf Software,Action | General | General,Computer Games Magazine,40,It contains many individual elements that are quite good but those elements dont pull together into a cohesive—or enjoyable—whole.
Eat Them!,PlayStation 3,Dec-21-2010,FluffyLogic,Action | General | General,Machinima,45,Theres no emotional investment little challenge and nothing that shakes off happier memories of War of the Monsters.
Trillion: God of Destruction,PlayStation Vita,Mar-29-2016,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Destructoid,30,Trillion: God of Destruction isnt a game its a job; and not a very good one. This isnt something that should be played at home but instead in a cubical on a desk surrounded by unsigned TPS reports while Becky from accounting reminds you to sign Bills birthday card before he goes home for the day. And while the company you work for may be interesting the work you do is so mind-numbingly banal you cant help but wonder if your skills could be put to better use somewhere else.
Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns,DS,Jul-22-2008,Ninja Studio,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Roguelike,GameCritics,50,Being average isnt a bullet-point for the back of a box and if someones going to play a potentially punishing definitely repetitive roguelike I cant imagine that theyd want to put that kind of serious effort out for something thats just average at best.
007: Quantum of Solace,DS,Nov-4-2008,Vicarious Visions,Action | Action Adventure | General | Modern | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,Modojo,40,Do yourself a favor and go see the flick instead. Its cheaper and will give you bigger bang for your buck than this misfire.
Fossil League: Dino Tournament Championship,DS,Jan-22-2007,MTO,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG,Eurogamer,40,Perfectly competent in execution yet lacking that spark that makes us visibly excited to cough up yet more money for almost exactly the same Pokémon game as the last forty-four when Diamond and Pearl land over here.
Eternal Poison,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2008,Flight-Plan,Strategy | General,IGN,35,Even the potential gothic charm of Thage is lost in a sea of confusing menus uninspired combat awkward interfaces and plain ol poor choices.
Axis & Allies,PC,Nov-2-2004,TimeGate Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,PC Gamer,35,A disaster. [Feb 2005 p.60]
Journey of a Roach,PC,Nov-4-2013,Koboldgames,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Hardcore Gamer,40,Journey of a Roach is a bog-standard adventure game built around a single kind of nifty idea.
MotoGP 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-28-2008,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,IGN,50,Die-hard fans of the real-life motorcycle racing championships will no doubt be interested in this game just for the personalities prototype bikes and tracks. They’re all here but that’s where the fun ends. Overall this is a functional but unexciting trip to the races.
Dig Dug: Digging Strike,DS,Oct-18-2005,Bullets,Action | Platformer | General | Platformer | 2D | 2D,The Sydney Morning Herald,50,Its a shame the innovative DS touch screen is hardly used here - play only requires use of the directional pad and buttons. The cat-and-mouse action is still as addictive as ever but the new changes are not that innovative.
Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts,PlayStation 4,Nov-22-2019,CI Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Game Rant,30,The end result is disappointing and frustrating.
Battle Princess Madelyn,Switch,Dec-20-2018,Causal Bit Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cubed3,50,The arcade mode trims most of the fat but it lacks the challenge and polish that defined the arcade era.
Poi: Explorer Edition,Switch,Oct-23-2017,PolyKid,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cubed3,40,Devoid of both style and substance Poi is perhaps the least interesting 3D platformer currently available for the Nintendo Switch. Not only is it mechanically shallow with a relatively skill ceiling and floor the level design rarely if ever gets creative enough to mask how lacklustre the platforming can be. To make matters worse this is just charmless all around thanks to an incredibly safe aesthetic that renders a potentially fascinating world completely unmemorable. This neither reinvents platforming nor serves as a suitable love letter to the genre ensuring it is best left forgotten.
Sword Art Online Re: Hollow Fragment,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,Namco Bandai Games | Bandai Namco Games | Aquria,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,RPGamer,30,At the end of the day Re: Hollow Fragment is lazy in every sense of the word and just isnt worth the dollars that Bandai Namco is asking for.
Fairy Fencer F,PlayStation 3,Sep-16-2014,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Game Revolution,40,There just isn’t anything of note really in Fairy Fencer F. It looks outdated feels meh at best and Seriously really? at worst.
A Virus Named TOM,PC,Aug-1-2012,Misfits Attic,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,PC Gamer UK,55,The extra frills dont add thrills to the tried Pipemania template. [Oct 2012 p.90]
Shotest Shogi,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2008,AI Factory | Rubicon Development Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,IGN,60,Shogi is the kind of game that you can get hooked on. If you enjoy chess playing and learning this variant will be right up your alley. However the 800 Microsoft point ($10 US) price tag will have you wishing more effort would have been put into the presentation and game options.
007: Quantum of Solace,PlayStation 3,Nov-4-2008,Treyarch,Action | General | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Video Game Talk,30,Its a dreary repetitive affair that never makes you feel excited to be in the shoes of James Bond.
Barnyard,Wii,Dec-4-2006,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action | Adventure | General | General,Gaming Age,42,Unfortunately due to the boring missions and the slow moving character and pace I would pass on Barnyard.
Pac-Man World 3,Xbox,Nov-17-2005,Blitz Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Mind-numbingly repetitive. [Jan 2006 p.75]
Dynasty Warriors 9,PlayStation 4,Feb-13-2018,Omega Force,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 3D,Metro GameCentral,40,Dynasty Warriors finally gets the overhaul it’s long been waiting for… and while it addresses a few old problems it creates just as many new ones.
Super Motherload,PlayStation 4,Nov-15-2013,XGenStudios,General | Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action,4Players.de,47,Playing this digging puzzler made me almost fall asleep. But as soon as you get a few players to help you you’ll uncover some fun buried under all that rubble.
SingStar Dance,PlayStation 3,Nov-1-2010,SCEE London Studio,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Dancing,PSM3 Magazine UK,48,Why didnt they make it better? [Christmas 2010 p.89]
War the Game,PC,Jan-12-2015,GabberGames,Strategy | Real-Time | Military,Games.cz,40,Its low price tag is not enough to overshadow the fact that War the Game delivers minimum content. Although it is natural to raise objections to its strategical aspect a small number of scenarios and no multiplayer game are the things that are fatally snapping its neck.
MachiaVillain,PC,May-16-2018,Wild Factor,Action | General,Games Master UK,45,A well-presented game but exploring shows its more dilapidated cabin than ominous mansion. [July 2018 p.65]
Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D,3DS,Jun-28-2011,Capcom,Action | Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Shooter | Survival | Third-Person | Tactical,1UP,25,Its hard to shake the feeling that Mercenaries 3D is the slimy result of a Capcom executive meeting titled What can we get away with this time?
Cate West: The Vanishing Files,Wii,Mar-23-2009,Destineer,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Nintendo Gamer,59,An acquired taste and definitely not for impatient gamers. [Nov 2009 p.69]
Birthdays the Beginning,PlayStation 4,May-9-2017,Arc System Works,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon | Action Adventure | Sandbox,GameCritics,45,While I absolutely love the concept of Birthdays: The Beginning the execution leaves much to be desired. It’s too passive and too finicky and doesn’t do enough with the core concept of life appearing and evolving over time. There’s not much here for seasoned players or curious kids and as someone who’s been playing games for a while I can say that this formula was done far far better on the SNES back in 1993 with EVO: Search For Eden. Look it up!
Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance,Xbox,Nov-5-2003,Acclaim Studios Manchester,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamePro,40,It has some slick production values and Acclaim goes all out on dreamy visuals gorgeously detailed architecture a Vikingly heroic score and juicy sound effects but skimps on any kind of depth and rewarding gameplay.
EyePet & Friends,PlayStation 3,Nov-15-2011,SCEE London Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Official PlayStation Magazine Benelux,55,Like in the previous Eyepet-games you never really get the feeling that you are actually petting the animals. Yes the animal reacts to the Move but the interaction is very limited. Its fun to toy around with the technology for a while but after that it gets boring. [December 2011 p.89]
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands,PSP,May-17-2010,Ubisoft Quebec,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamekult,40,A mediocre game well forget quite easily.
The Escapists: The Walking Dead,Xbox One,Sep-30-2015,Team17,Action | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,There are brief hints at what might have been but otherwise this is a walking dud. [Dec 2015 p.81]
Exit 2,Xbox 360,Feb-25-2009,Taito Corporation,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,Thunderbolt,40,A disappointing outing from Mr Esc and his associates as we’ll be expecting something very different for the next installment.
M.A.C.H. Modified Air Combat Heroes,PSP,Feb-20-2007,VU Games,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Other,Jolt Online Gaming UK,49,M.A.C.H is a sad waste of potential that feels like no one actually cared to deliver anything innovative or even competent.
Help Wanted: 50 Wacky Jobs,Wii,May-12-2009,Hudson Soft,Simulation | General | General,Nintendo Power,45,Times are tough but this is one job offer you should pass up. [June 2009 p.90]
Gauntlet,Xbox 360,Nov-22-2005,Digital Eclipse,Action | General | General | Arcade,WHAM! Gaming,30,The worst part is you can basically hit a button to get more and more health as opposed to adding quarters in the arcades back in the day.
Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain,PlayStation 2,May-4-2004,Sony Bend,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,Gaming Age,16,Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain easily ranks among the worst titles I have ever played on the PlayStation 2 an astounding feat considering that the game came from Sony themselves.
Lords of the Realm III,PC,Mar-17-2004,Impressions Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General,Computer and Video Games,19,God knows what happened to LOTR3 but the usually dependable Impressions Games has lost the plot on this one. Even if youre a long-standing fan of the series - no especially if you are one - avoid this like a bearded Black Death-infected Saxon whore.
Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus,Xbox,Mar-18-2003,Studio Gigante,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpy,38,It takes a few stabs at innovating but alas its turned out to be worse than mediocre: its lousy.
Strike Fighters: Project 1,PC,Oct-27-2002,Third Wire,Simulation | Flight | Old Jet | Combat,Computer Gaming World,40,Numerous bugs and missing features indicate Strike Fighters was pushed out the door a few months before its time. Again. [Mar 2003 p.105]
S.W.I.N.E.,PC,Nov-19-2001,Stormregion,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Tactics,Computer Gaming World,40,I dont think Ive ever seen worse pathfinding in a game. [May 2002 p.75]
Tennis Masters Series,PC,Nov-18-2001,Microids,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Tennis | Tennis,Yahoo!,40,Yet another addition to the long line of awful tennis games for the PC.
Hoard,PC,Apr-4-2011,Big Sandwich Games | Inc.,Action | General | General,Gaming Age,42,The problem I found is that it felt like the RTS equivalent of button mashing; if I lost Id just as soon turn it off than feel all that compelled to try a different strategy. A shame really because theres nothing technically wrong with the game.
Juiced: Eliminator,PSP,Jun-28-2006,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Modojo,40,Juiced: Eliminator isnt bottom of the barrel but it comes in at a distant third when the underground racing genre has already gone well into its life span and thats not good news.
Party Hard,PlayStation 4,Apr-26-2016,Pinokl Games,Action | General,DarkStation,50,Party Hard presents some interesting ideas and has a promising start but it sours quickly due to repetitive game design and a frustrating inconsistency in difficulty.
MS Saga: A New Dawn,PlayStation 2,Feb-21-2006,Bandai,Role-Playing | General,Yahoo!,40,A game with no surprises and a superficial combat model but giant robot fetishists and long-time series fans at least have one less reason to complain.
Away: Shuffle Dungeon,DS,Oct-30-2008,Mistwalker | Artoon,Role-Playing | General | General,Metro GameCentral,40,Its all a shame because the central idea of a constantly transforming dungeon is a good one. The actual game thats been constructed around it though is nowhere near good enough.
Wild West Guns,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Gameloft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,Zentendo,50,Wild West Guns is best looked at as perhaps a good first attempt. It has good settings and sound to suck you in to the Wild West theme but the actual gameplay just falls short. The controls are great and responsive but the game itself is just too repetitive and gets boring quickly. If more variety had been added then perhaps a higher score could have been given.
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PSP,Dec-11-2005,Crave,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,AceGamez,40,It isnt a terrible game but neither is it a good one. For those wanting to play a game of poker without the hassle of dealing cards or finding friends to play against then this game is an adequate substitute.
Crash 'N' Burn,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Arcade,The Sydney Morning Herald,50,While the cars in other games fold and dent realistically depending on the speed and direction of the impact damage to Crash n Burns cars seems artificial with entire panels suddenly replaced with scratched versions at the merest hint of a high-speed nudge.
Need for Speed Underground 2,DS,May-10-2005,EA Canada,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Pelaaja (Finland),40,The unique capabilities of DS’s dual screens are not used very well. Touch screen serves only as a map and as touch activation for nitro boost. As a driving game NFSU 2 DS does not feed the need for speed. Driving simply feels too slow paced. [August 2005 p.68]
Painkiller: Overdose,PC,Oct-26-2007,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PC Zone UK,38,A headache. [Feb 2008 p.88]
Bee Simulator,Switch,Nov-12-2019,Varsav Game Studios,Simulation | General,DarkZero,40,The premise for Bee Simulator is good and I like the idea of doing education through video games in such a uniquely refreshing way but the execution here has problems. When the game is not asking much from the player then Bee Simulator ends up being somewhat fun with a great sense of scale but the controls hamper such an important part of the game that the experience ends up being frustrating. Throw in repetitive tasks and muddy visuals and what you have is a video game that sadly does not deliver on its potential. It is hard to recommend Bee Simulator out right especially at its asking price but some of the younger kids might enjoy what Bee Simulator has to offer.
Morphite,Switch,Nov-2-2017,Crescent Moon Games,Action Adventure | General,TheSixthAxis,30,There is such a thing as being too laid-back and Morphite is most certainly that. With visuals that are too basic and lacking in character an almost sleep inducing pace and some technical issues on Switch that can’t be ignored there are few redeeming qualities for this utter snooze-fest.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,DS,Nov-14-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gaming Age,25,The graphics are there as is some of the sound and a few decent gameplay elements but the boring combat system repetitive scenery and horrible menu set up really keeps the game from ever becoming more than a mediocre waste of time.
Arena Football,Xbox,Feb-7-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,G4 TV,40,Arena Football may be an engaging sport to watch in real life with the excitement of packed arenas and the promise of frenzied action on the shortened field but the developers did a poor job in conveying that sense of atmosphere in the game.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1: In Too Deep,Xbox One,Feb-23-2016,Skybound LLC | Skybound Games,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Official Xbox Magazine UK,50,Its easy to accredit the success of Telltales original Walking Dead to the strength of the fiction its working with but this flat opening salvo lacks the same nuances. [Apr 2016 p.77]
Sparkle 2,Xbox One,Jan-27-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Puzzle | Matching,We Got This Covered,30,Sparkle 2 is a clone of an almost 20 year old game and does nothing interesting with the core idea introduced in Puzz Loop.
Prince of Persia Revelations,PSP,Dec-6-2005,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Fantasy | Fantasy | Linear,NTSC-uk,30,People wanting a game to get their teeth into will certainly find it a challenge although many will also be tearing their hair out by the handful. The one question on many people’s lips is why port Warrior Within of all the games in the Prince of Persia trilogy? Why not simply begin with Sands of Time and start at the beginning.
Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2005,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,GamerFeed,40,While it captures the sweet essence of the film from so long ago it fails to motivate with its stale gameplay.
Outward,Xbox One,Mar-26-2019,Nine Dots Studio,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Survival | Open-World,GameSpew,50,It’s undeniable that Outward‘s combat is sub-par and that its systems prove to be very punishing when combined.
Choplifter HD,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2012,InXile Entertainment,General | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Gameblog.fr,40,The concept gameplay challenge and atmosphere of Choplifter HD are quite good. It is a nice trip back in the 80s even if it is far from being a must-have today as the game is particulary repetitive and its price is quite high.
Cookie & Cream,DS,Jul-2-2007,Hi Corp,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GamesRadar+,30,There’s some minigames and a wi-fi Battle mode but good luck trying to play with a friend more than once. We wanted to adore Cookie & Cream; it’s a shame we only get a clumsy mess.
Secret Files: Tunguska,Wii,Jun-22-2010,10tacle Studios | Fusionsphere Systems,Adventure | Third-Person | General | Modern,games(TM),50,Dedicated genre fans meanwhile will find that the concessions in the gameplay – pre-highlighted hot spots and rumble hints – are both insulting to their intelligence and at odds with the entire point of the adventure genre. [June 2008 p.123]
Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon,PC,Aug-21-2008,Kheops Studio,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,GameSpot,50,Dreary and dated.
The Awakened Fate: Ultimatum,PlayStation 3,Mar-17-2015,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | General | Roguelike,PlayStation Universe,40,A shell of its predecessor. All the fun mechanics from Guided Fate Paradox have been removed and changed leaving a generic but tedious combat system. The story while potentially interesting has major pacing and voice acting issues that dull the experience. Only a diehard NIS fan will want to play this game.
Blacklight: Tango Down,PC,Jul-14-2010,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,LEVEL (Czech Republic),50,Absences of multi-player opponents and lack of any in-game improvements are the major disadvantages of this average first person shooter. [Issue#195]
Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,PC,Jun-10-2016,Frogwares,Adventure | General,PCWorld,40,Three weak cases one decent and a lackluster finale make Sherlock Holmes: The Devils Daughter a marked step back from its predecessor.
Matt Hazard: Blood Bath and Beyond,PlayStation 3,Jan-7-2010,Vicious Cycle,Action | Action Adventure | Modern | Shooter | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GameShark,33,If it wasn’t bad enough that the game pokes fun at its previous release saying it can be picked at a bargain bin near you and continues the self-deprecating with a quip at the end dealing with the dreadfulness you just played through one can’t help but agree and have a sort of resentment that the developers knew the game was not up to par with other XBLA - or even Xbox Live Indie games - but still went ahead and released it which is probably the most humorous thing the game has going for it.
Blair Witch,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,Push Square,40,Blair Witchs strongest aspect -- its eerie woodland setting -- is perfect for a focused streamlined horror experience. Unfortunately thats not what this game is and the superfluous gimmicky gameplay mechanics that are thrown at you with reckless abandon only serve to make the game less effective as a whole. A disappointing story frustrating level design and precious few genuine scares leaves us hoping that this is one franchise that gets lost in the woods.
Metal Wolf Chaos XD,PC,Aug-6-2019,From Software | General Arcade,Simulation | Vehicle | Combat,GameSpot,40,Metal Wolf Chaos is an old game with a wild reputation and though it lives up to it in some ways its not good in general. At best its a curio that helps inform the story of From Softwares trajectory over the years. At worst its a frustratingly shallow experience that fails to capitalize on its best qualities.
Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 2,Xbox One,Feb-5-2019,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Xbox Tavern,50,Considering that it’s a sequel and despite its efforts Monster Energy Supercross 2 doesn’t feel wholly refined overall. The game suffers considerably due to its loose handling its steep difficulty curve and its excessive loading times. That said there’s enough diverse content on offer to keep die-hard fans entertained until next time. Just don’t expect the quality to have come on in leaps and bounds in comparison to its predecessor.
Smash Hit Plunder,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,Triangular Pixels,Strategy | General,PlayStation Country,50,Smash Hit Plunder is an accessible looting game that sticks to one simple concept which is smashing everything in sight. It works well for a while but fell a bit flat after repeated play sessions. The asynchronous multiplayer options are a nice addition but you might struggle to find players who want to play this more than once.
Gekido: Kintaro's Revenge,Switch,Mar-22-2018,Naps Team,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Switch Player,40,Gekido Kintaro’s Revenge is a very simple beat-em-up which probably didn’t warrant a physical release on Switch. Unfair gameplay unsatisfying visuals and sloppy proofing work mean this is one to miss.
Human: Fall Flat,Switch,Dec-7-2017,No Brakes Games,Action Adventure | General,Cubed3,30,Human: Fall Flat on Nintendo Switch is neither good if labelled as a purposely bad game nor as a physics puzzler. Why? It is purely because the controls make things more aggravating than hilarious and secondly due to how uninspiring the puzzles themselves are. Thats why.
Star Wars Battlefront II,PC,Nov-17-2017,EA DICE,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Destructoid,50,As much as I loathe this implementation of loot boxes I still keep playing Battlefront II and I will probably continue to do so on and off. I mean I do like the game. I just wish it wasnt being squandered like this. Youd be well-advised to wait until overhauls arrive -- assuming they ever do.
Xenoraid,PlayStation 4,Nov-8-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons Ltd | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Impulsegamer,50,Xenoraid is competently built but lacks any real reason to actually compel you to play it. The gameplay loop quickly becomes monotonous and aside from quick bursts here and there whilst waiting for a download I can’t see many gamers putting much time into conquering the alien attackers.
Abyss Odyssey: Extended Dream Edition,PlayStation 4,Jul-28-2015,ACE Team,Action Adventure | Linear,Twinfinite,40,This game so difficult to play through in the first place: the clunky and robotic feel of your characters and their movements. Extended Dream Edition is a regurgitation of the same nightmare that surfaced last year and I can’t recommend it to anyone who isn’t already utterly enamored with the game’s beautiful aesthetics.
War for the Overworld,PC,Apr-2-2015,Subterranean Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer.nl,45,War for the Overworld was supposed to be the new Dungeon Keeper. They were on the right track but the game that is available for download now is definitely not right; lots of bugs crashes bad AI and many missing features make this game impossible to recommend.
Rio,PlayStation 3,Apr-12-2011,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Miscellaneous | General | General,Gamekult,30,Quotation forthcoming.
Rogue Ops,GameCube,Oct-29-2003,Bits Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,Edge Magazine,20,Objects that can be interacted with are circled with an icon but this only appears if you are looking at exactly the right spot. Indeed much of Rogue Ops is spent trying to make this cursed cursor appear. Its not a pleasant way to spend an evening. [Feb 2004 p.108]
Summer Heat Beach Volleyball,PlayStation 2,Jul-1-2003,Acclaim Studios Cheltenham,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,PSM Magazine,30,Plagued with underdeveloped AI and repetitive clunky gameplay SHBV is one of the least appealing games of 2003. [Sept 2003 p.38]
Gungrave,PlayStation 2,Sep-16-2002,Seta Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Game Revolution,33,A great animated cartoon cleverly disguised as a rather lame Playstation 2 game. Great presentation is wasted on forgettable gameplay.
Mad Maestro!,PlayStation 2,Mar-12-2002,Desert Productions,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Game Revolution,33,Pressing one button over and over at different pressure levels doesnt ring my bell and I doubt it will ring most of yours.
Darkened Skye,PC,Jan-27-2002,Boston Animation,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Fantasy,Game Revolution,50,Rather than mixing action adventure and puzzle a narrower focus with more snide remarks and witty writing would have led to a better game.
Monsters Inc. Scream Team,PlayStation,Oct-30-2001,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General,Game Revolution,50,Fine for its intended audience. Simple gameplay with familiar heroes is enough to keep the little ones occupied for a while. Just dont expect anyone over the age of six to go ga-ga over it.
Thunderstrike: Operation Phoenix,PlayStation 2,Oct-15-2001,Core Design Ltd.,Action | Simulation | Shooter | Flight | Third-Person | Helicopter | Modern,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,Why does the game look like crap? [Jan 2002 p.141]
Yoshi's New Island,3DS,Mar-14-2014,Arzest,Action | Platformer | 2D,Eurogamer,40,It might look a little like Yoshis Island then but its a worse game in every regard. 19 years on from the original its design has been denuded of almost everything that made it great: a series once fecund with ideas is now coasting on past glories.
Alpha Protocol,PlayStation 3,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,The Escapist,40,The RPG elements work well and are loads of fun to explore but they only add up to half a game. Whats left over is a brainless broken mess.
Dynasty Warriors: Gundam Reborn,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2014,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,4Players.de,41,Reborn – sounds like a new beginning doesn’t it? But it isn’t. This is little more than a superficial sequel that at its core is less satisfying than its predecessor.
F1 2015,Xbox One,Jul-21-2015,Codemasters,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Pure Xbox,40,Were not exactly seeing what the wait was for when it comes to F1 2015. The game is clearly rushed riddled with bugs and lacking in some relatively basic features.
Monopoly Streets,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,Electronic Arts,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Gameblog.fr,40,Monopoly Streets does have some aces to play but cant make us forget that its still funnier with the real tabletop version.
Danger Zone,PC,May-29-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Quarter to Three,40,Danger Zone is good for a couple of fancy crashes and not much else before an uninstall. It’s like a mild hit-and-run where it was never really worth taking the other driver’s insurance information anyway.
Diner Dash: Sizzle & Serve,DS,May-23-2007,Climax Group | PlayFirst | Climax Studios,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General | Action,Nintendo Gamer,45,Its very little fun to play and since you can play a limited version online for free as a Flash game theres no good reason to put it in your DS. [June 2007 p.70]
Mario Party 7,GameCube,Nov-7-2005,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Party,Eurogamer,30,Its such a shame that Nintendo - the creator of Mario Kart which is arguably the most fun you can have with platonic friends - just cant seem to sort Mario Partys problems out even for the seventh instalment in the series. Roll on number eight eh.
Secret Files 2: Puritas Cordis,PC,Oct-29-2009,Fusionsphere Systems | Animation Arts,Adventure | General | General,Total PC Gaming,50,An interesting story but the overall package isnt engaging enough. [Issue#20 p.56]
Spyro: A Hero's Tail,Xbox,Nov-3-2004,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Platformer | 3D,Stuff,40,We grew bored of the sheer repetitiveness of the game play and not even Spyros smart-ass remarks could keep us amused. Just talk to the hand Spyro. Snap!
Onimusha Tactics,Game Boy Advance,Nov-11-2003,Capcom,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Nintendojo,35,Onimusha Tactics wouldnt be that bad if there werent so many strategy games already available to the GBA. But there are. And compared to the rest of the flock Onimusha sucks.
AO Tennis 2,Switch,Feb-11-2020,Big Ant Studios,Sports | Individual | Tennis,FNintendo,50,AO Tennis 2 on the Nintendo Switch sets expectations high but for a tennis simulation everything falls below the required standards. While the career mode and the player creation tool are interesting the games cast of players feels disconnected from reality while the gameplay feels too demanding and the graphics are simply out of date for the current time. Adding some performance issues to that doesnt make AO Tennis 2 any better and in the end what could have been a good tennis simulation falls into a more disappointing side of the spectrum.
Bloo Kid 2,3DS,May-7-2015,winterworks,Action | Platformer | 2D,Digitally Downloaded,20,Its a horribly generic platformer that tries hard to be some kind of homage to the genres greats and ends up being a pale imitation of them all. Sure its cheap as chips on the Nintendo 3DS but that doesnt mean its worth the time investment.
Naval War: Arctic Circle,PC,Apr-10-2012,Turbo Tape Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General,Everyeye.it,50,Naval War: Artic Circle could have been a good title but it lacks in so many aspects gameplay-wise that in the end it is not very satisfying for the RTS fan. The missions are too simple and the multiplayer should be enhanced with more maps and scenarios. On top of this a poor technical realization.
Go Vacation,Wii,Oct-11-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Gamereactor Sweden,20,When I played Go Vacation I heard the ticking clock of my life eating up the hours as I struggled with the pointless mini-games. You can avoid this. For me its too late.
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Autobots,DS,Jun-23-2009,Vicarious Visions,Action | Adventure | Shooter | Beat-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person | 3D | Arcade,Worth Playing,50,Overall Im not sure that Id suggest Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – Autobots to anyone other than die-hard Transformer fans even though it really doesnt do the franchise any justice.
Gear.Club Unlimited,Switch,Nov-21-2017,Eden Games Mobile,Action | General | Racing | Simulation | Automobile,JeuxActu,45,Gear.Club Unlimited is just a bad port of an otherwise successful mobile racing game. Even if the content is generous the game is expensive the gameplay is a joke the AI is crap and the graphics are ugly. Dont bother with this one if you really like cars and racing games.
Lucky's Tale,PC,Mar-28-2016,Playful Corp.,Action | Platformer | 3D,GameSpot,50,Luckys Tale seems like it would be a good fit for someone who doesnt normally play games and has mild curiosity in VR. Experienced players will certainly appreciate the great controls but thats it. Its hard to get upset about a game thats technically free but its worth acknowledging that Luckys Tale is too basic to get excited about and not inventive enough to communicate the potential of VR.
Crystal Quest,Xbox 360,Feb-5-2006,Stainless Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Static | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,Tat. [Issue#5 p.120]
Atari Classics Evolved,PSP,Dec-19-2007,Stainless Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Game Revolution,42,On the one hand there are more than sixty games available in portable form. Some of them have even been genuinely enhanced if youre interested. Unfortunately many players probably wont have the patience to unlock the full library of classics and will be stuck with the eleven that are available from the start.
Dusk Diver,PlayStation 4,Oct-29-2019,JFi Games,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Cubed3,50,Dusk Diver struggles to make a memorable impact due to its story and gameplay failings. This is not helped by its technical issues. Nevertheless despite its blandness there is some charisma beneath the surface thanks to a memorable supporting cast and a clear sense of passion in its worlds conception. Its difficult to recommend it but for those who do give it a go there is a noteworthy personality here that keeps things ticking.
Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection,PlayStation 3,Nov-6-2012,Pyramid,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Eurogamer Italy,50,The Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection is pretty dumb. Budokai 3 is still a great game but the lack of any kind of online mode and the crazy absence of Budokai 2 transform a good chance into a sad nonsense.
Conduit 2,Wii,Apr-19-2011,High Voltage Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Joystiq,20,Theres only one 4-minute bit in the entire thing that was fun to play and that was tailgunning in the spaceship. So at least the whole review wasnt negative amirite?
Defiance,PC,Apr-2-2013,Trion Worlds,Massively Multiplayer Online | Role-Playing | Sci-Fi | Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Quarter to Three,40,Defiance is mostly lacking meaningful connective tissue. It fails at the fundamental task of feeling like a thoughtfully designed and polished game. It fails at feeling like a world. It fails at giving you much to look forward to once you’ve realized you’ve seen most of what it’s ever going to do. You can only get so far with it’s fun to shoot stuff. About Defiance far.
Battles of Prince of Persia,DS,Dec-6-2005,Ubisoft Montreal,Strategy | Miscellaneous | Turn-Based | Card Battle | Card Battle,Modojo,40,A strategic card battler thats missing out on any fun intuitive design or worst of all a point. Stick to your Advance Wars and leave this battlefield empty.
Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Aspyr | Aspire,Action Adventure | Linear,Cubed3,50,A flawed port that struggles to overcome mediocrity in its implementation and that suffers from a lack of multiplayer leads to a less than stellar experience. Star Wars Jedi Outcast is purely saved by its solid level design and fan service. There are probably better options if you want a good TV experience but nothing can beat this ports portable experience which is in all honestly its saving grace. Recommended for fans looking to take it on holiday and a near miss for fans looking for a Star Wars title worthy of being played in the big screen.
Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters: Daybreak Special Gigs,PlayStation 4,Sep-20-2016,Arc System Works | Now Production,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,ZTGD,50,Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters Daybreak is a title that showed a lot of promise with a great art style and an interesting premise. However the atrocious combat mechanics hinder the overall enjoyment of the game so much to the point it’s difficult to recommend to anyone in particular.
Master of Orion 3,PC,Feb-25-2003,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | 4X,GMR Magazine,10,Then theres the weak arbitrary enemy A.I. the impenetrable interface and the absurdly incomplete documentation. [June 2003 p.70]
Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts,Xbox 360,May-17-2011,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | First-Person | First-Person | Western-Style,Metro GameCentral,50,A typical Fallout download that buries a few interesting new ideas and locations beneath a patchwork of overfamiliar and increasingly outdated content.
Cargo! The Quest for Gravity,PC,Apr-21-2011,Ice-Pick Lodge,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | General | Fantasy,PC PowerPlay,40,Proof that gleeful surrealism does not automatically indicate arthouse brilliance. [Aug 2011 p.74]
theHunter: Call of the Wild,PC,Feb-16-2017,Expansive Worlds,Sports | Individual | Nature | Hunting,TheSixthAxis,40,When theHunter: Call of the Wild works properly it’s still going to be a game that only those with the patience of a saint would enjoy. It’s very slow full of barriers and isn’t very exciting. That’s not to say it’s not completely without merit as it’s a stunner to look at and there are rare occasions where everything comes together to make a compelling experience. Just note that those rare occasions are few and far between.
StarDrone,PlayStation 3,Apr-5-2011,Beatshapers,Action | General | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,It just isnt any fun. [Apr 2011 p.114]
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2004,Interplay,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Eurogamer,30,If you have any respect for the way games should be made then give Interplay a clear message that it simply has to do better than this to compete in the games market. Treat BOS with contempt it deserves and avoid it at all costs - even buying this at a budget price would be irresponsible.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,PlayStation 2,Dec-8-2003,Paradigm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,games(TM),30,Dilute disjointed and uninspiring. Feeling more like a staggered set of obstacles than a wholesome game the action sadly boils down to little more than a tediously dull showcase for your equipment and abilities which are put into use against some questionable AI stooges. [Jan 2004 p.118]
Heroes of Might and Magic IV: The Gathering Storm,PC,Sep-26-2002,3DO,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General,Computer Gaming World,30,Its a lot more of the same - the same grinding disenchantment. [Feb 2003 p.80]
ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002,PlayStation 2,Jan-14-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Gaming Age,42,No matter what type of game you are looking for the control takes some getting used to.
Silent Scope 2: Dark Silhouette,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2001,KCET,Action | Shooter | Rail,Game Revolution,42,This is one port that went from arcade star to console dog. Heinous dude.
Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff,PlayStation 2,Apr-18-2001,New World Computing,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG,PSX Nation,40,If you love this series on PC then stick to it there because the essence of what makes HMM is just hinted at on PS2.
Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business,PC,Nov-30-2000,Sir-Tech Software Inc.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Modern | Tactics,Daily Radar,0,A pale shadow of a flawed but fun game. If the designers do not have more in them than this the Jagged Alliance series should end here.
Assassin's Creed Liberation HD,PlayStation 3,Jan-14-2014,Ubisoft Sofia,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,Playstation Official Magazine UK,50,Sadly Liberation can’t escape its limited gameplay technical unevenness and poorly told story. While Black Flag kicked the series on the past holds no glory for Aveline.
UEFA Euro 2012,PC,Apr-24-2012,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,GRYOnline.pl,35,A waek game in almost every aspect - the most painful being missing licences and castrated game modes that were supposed to be the biggest advantages of this game. Well made stadiums supporters songs and new commentary track are not enough to justify a high price tag.
We Cheer 2,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Machatin | Inc.,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing | Dancing,Game Revolution,42,I guess if you find yourself in need of a game for a preppy young lass this could be a recipe for success. If youre a fan of rhythm games there isnt anything here of substance so any fun you have while waving to an imaginary virtual jailbait kid wont last too long.
Murder in the Abbey,PC,Aug-26-2008,Alcachofa Soft,Adventure | General | General,IGN,35,The back of the box promises 40 hours of gameplay. You do not want 40 hours of gameplay here.
Wild ARMs XF,PSP,Mar-11-2008,Media Vision,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,1UP,42,The game has some ambition and I admire that. But in the end a score is based on how much fun I have (thats why we play right?) and I had very little fun playing Wild Arms XF. This says it all: I cant wait to whip out strategy gems like Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea on my commute...but I had to force myself to drag out XF.
The Sinking City,PlayStation 4,Jun-25-2019,Frogwares,Action Adventure | Survival,GameSpot,30,Its hard to resent a game as unapologetically dweeby as The Sinking City. Its an old-fashioned bookish mystery rooted in the mythology and mysteries of a pulpy cult-favorite mid-century American novelist--an effort not without charm to be sure. But no matter how fond your affection for H.P. Lovecraft and the idea of a wide-eyed slow-burn literary adventure the poor design cliched writing and lumbering pace make this far more tedious than delightful let alone unsettling or terrifying.
Corruption 2029,PC,Feb-17-2020,The Bearded Ladies Consulting,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,The game does not offend but also doesn´t inspire. If it had more original content it would certainly receive a more positive feedback. Therefore it is only an average game. [Issue#302]
Urban Trial Freestyle,3DS,Jun-27-2013,Strangelands Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Driving | Racing | General | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,DarkStation,20,I really enjoyed the previous versions of this game but the 3DS version is sadly just not worth anyone’s time.
The Legend of Korra,PC,Oct-21-2014,PlatinumGames,Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,CD-Action,60,Without Activision at the helm and its policy on licensed games – done too quickly and too cheap – it could have been an epic adventure. [01/2015 p.80]
Pressure,PC,Mar-26-2013,Chasing Carrots,Action | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,4Players.de,50,The steampunk approach in track and vehicle design is charming but mechanics lack variety and most of all tight controls regardless if you enter the course with a gamepad keyboard or mouse at your disposal.
Dragon Age II: Legacy,Xbox 360,Jul-26-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Action RPG,Eurogamer,50,A passable addition to the game but one that doesnt do anything to make itself essential. Better than a lot of BioWare DLC packs but nowhere near as satisfying as their best work.
MXGP Pro,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Push Square,30,Saying that Milestone need to take a step back with its dirt bike games and rework everything is becoming as tired a statement as saying Telltale needs to use a new engine. But it remains true yet again with MXGP Pro. A very slight improvement over MXGP 3 but a noticeable step back from Monster Energy Supercross MXGP Pro is largely a spectacular disaster. It gets a couple things right and offers a new slate of tracks to race on but you’ll be too busy slamming your head into a wall to really notice.
Chasing Aurora,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Broken Rules,Action | General | Flight | Flight,Everyeye.it,45,Chasing Aurora is a Competitive Party Game that does not work. The weakness of the gameplay structure and a not involving single player made every effort useful. A bad game to stay away from.
Deadcore,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2017,Grip Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,TheSixthAxis,30,Challenge fiends may still have a good time with DeadCore although in its current state I would be reluctant to recommend the console port over the PC version – if you have one. Originally a project by a fledgling group of five young French developers DeadCore shows some promise as a platforming first title: the basic mechanics are generally good and fun to use. It’s a shame the game is entirely let down by poor controls and sometimes cheap challenge design both of which are at odds with the game’s speedrunning ethos.
Sonic Heroes,PlayStation 2,Jan-27-2004,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,NTSC-uk,30,Its tricks are old and it offers no challenge but for the irksome nuisances of its design. [JPN Import]
Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness,GameCube,Sep-11-2002,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General,IGN,53,Its just a game concept that wears off quickly.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PlayStation,Nov-15-2001,Argonaut Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,40,A lesson in boredom. Without a jump command the platforming elements are all but wasted while the spell-flinging portions of the game are equally forgettable.
Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open,Xbox,Nov-14-2001,Rockstar San Diego,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,All Game Guide,40,All of the problems the off-road games have experienced in the past are as visible in this version as a Hummer with its high beams on.
4x4 Evolution,PlayStation 2,Feb-26-2001,Terminal Reality,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,All Game Guide,40,The racing environments suffer from the PlayStation 2s notorious texture limitations.
Gunbird 2,Dreamcast,Nov-17-2000,Psikyo,Action | General,Daily Radar,0,All flash and no substance Gunbird 2 is too hard too short and too boring to even bother looking at.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD Ver.,PlayStation 3,Aug-21-2012,Capcom,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Game Revolution,40,There are isolated moments of the funny and interesting like one of the 26 fighters being a small dog (I think its a chihuahua but Im not entirely sure). It makes me feel like a bad person but kicking a possessed dog is mildly amusing… the first time. Then it becomes another cheap and frustrating match with the AI.
Sid Meier's Pirates!,Wii,Sep-28-2010,Virtuos,Strategy | General | General,GameZone,35,Sid Meiers Pirates! is another perfect example of a great game gone bad when its poorly ported to consoles. Skip Sid Meiers Pirates; unless you are a glutton for punishment.
SimCity,PC,Mar-5-2013,Maxis,Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Strategy | City Building | Management | Modern | Modern | Government,Quarter to Three,20,If Electronic Arts is going to make a game with the basic premise being that no city is an island if theyre going to stress the interaction among cities if theyre going to make playing alongside other people a cornerstone of the design if theyre going to force my creations into tiny boxes that cannot exist past a certain point without the help of other tiny boxes theyre going to have to do the hard work of making it actually work. And ideally that hard work should be done before they sell people the game not after theyve been caught flat-footed for botching it so completely.
Gods Will Be Watching,PC,Jul-24-2014,Devolver Digital,Adventure | General | Point-and-Click,Riot Pixels,35,In 2013 Deconstructeam entered a Ludum Dare competition with a bare bones concept of a game. Now a year later this game has a price tag but it’s bare just as it was back then.
Planet of the Eyes,Xbox One,Sep-12-2017,Coco Cucumber | Cococucumber,Action | Platformer | 2D,XBLA Fans,40,Planet of the Eyes is a surprisingly short game clocking in at around an hour and a half. The game just doesnt have the level of polish that allows such a length to be excusable. Its an incredibly simplistic take on gameplay and narrative ideas weve all seen a million times before never doing anything new or memorable. Even at its best it amounts to little more than a bland experience one that will be over quickly and easily forgotten.
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit,PC,Oct-3-2012,Arkedo Studio,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,IGN,49,There are good ideas but thats not enough.
Of Orcs and Men,Xbox 360,Oct-24-2012,Cyanide | Spiders,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG | Western-Style,GameOver.gr,40,You could say that Of Orcs and Men reminds us of games of the distant past but we cant remember RPGs of the old days being so bad. Despite its surprisingly fun and interesting story Of Orcs and Men is a game that struggles and fails to achieve mediocrity.
The Lord of the Rings: Tactics,PSP,Nov-8-2005,Amaze Entertainment,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Tactics,Computer Games Magazine,30,Its a short vacuous game thats over quickly and even more quickly forgotten. [Feb 2006 p.93]
Musashi: Samurai Legend,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Square Enix,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Computer and Video Games,30,Theres a smattering of good ideas in Samurai Legend but theyre quickly crushed under the obesity of mindless combat and poor design. One to avoid. [PSW]
SpongeBob Squigglepants 3D,3DS,May-17-2011,WayForward,Miscellaneous | General | General,Gamekult,40,Quotation forthcoming.
Restaurant Empire II,PC,May-26-2009,Enlight Software,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,You can admire the complexity and new ideas in Restaurant Empire 2 like cafés or patisseries but you can’t deny the confusing controls and the fact it soon gets repetitive and boring. [Aug 2009]
Disney*Pixar WALL-E,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Heavy Iron Studios | Savage Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Gaming Age,33,For the handhelds the PSP version resembles the home console titles for the most part but with the worst visuals of the bunch. The controls also feel completely off and the entire game is more frustrating to play than the other titles.
Hardwood Hearts,Xbox 360,Dec-8-2005,Silver Creek Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Board / Card Game | Gambling,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,No attempt at making its single-player outing more interesting than exhibition matches also stinks. [Issue#23 p.97]
SIMULACRA,Switch,Dec-3-2019,Kaigan Games OU,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,Screen Rant,50,Simulacra is a horror game about investigating a missing girls cellphone that has moments of brilliance but doesnt quite live up to its concept.
Snooker 19,PlayStation 4,Apr-16-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Gamer.nl,60,Snooker 19 does the absolute minimum of what you may expect from a snooker game. Playing snooker is fun but as a package this game is a let-down.
The Council - Episode 5: Checkmate,PlayStation 4,Dec-4-2018,Big Bad Wolf,Adventure | General,Jeuxvideo.com,55,This final chapter of The Council shines in its art design and provides a great way to take sides in the final intrigue. Unfortunately the ending is expeditive and a bit disappointing. Moreover the game still having some problems with animations lips sync and framerate.
Grand Ages: Medieval,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2015,Gaming Minds Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Riot Pixels,30,In an attempt to please all kinds of strategy players by adding city building trading and wars Grand Ages: Medieval miserably fails on all accounts.
WRC 2: FIA World Rally Championship 2011,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2011,MileStone Inc.,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Metro GameCentral,50,The official World Rally Championship game is looking tired on just its second outing with very few improvements to the first game and far too many flaws.
Alien Breed 3: Descent,PC,Nov-17-2010,Team17,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IncGamers,27,Wedged between survival horror and arcade shooter - but succeeding at neither - Descent is a poorly designed camera-hampered end to an already weak trilogy.
Kholat,PC,Jun-9-2015,IMGN.PRO,Fantasy | Adventure | 3D | First-Person,GameSpot,40,Its ideas reveal the game Kholat wanted to be but its aspirations soar far higher than the game it became. What good is a mystery if you dont care about what it might tell you?
Sid Meier's Starships,PC,Mar-12-2015,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General,Riot Pixels,25,This awful strategy game is not worthy of even a single playthrough neither on PC nor on tablets.
Infliction: Extended Cut,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2020,Caustic Reality,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,The Digital Fix,40,Infliction: Extended Cut derives almost all of its best ideas from much better games making the whole thing feel like a chore rather than an ordeal. It simply does not cut it.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,PC,Jun-30-2009,EA Bright Light,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Format,46,At times it feels like Dead Ringers the Game with a load of people doing not-quite accurate impressions while looking rather unlike the real actors. [Sept 2009 p.98]
Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species,PC,Oct-19-2005,Blue Fang Games,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Gaming Horizon,49,It’s a CD that adds about 20 endangered animals to your existing game of Zoo Tycoon 2 and that’s about it.
Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight,PlayStation 4,Jul-7-2017,Artdink,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameOver.gr,30,Accel World Vs. Sword Art Online besides being addressed to a very limited audience comes with many problems (technical and design-wise) which means that even hardcore fans of the two franchises will be discouraged by the problematic nature of the title.
Star Soldier R,Wii,May-19-2008,Hudson Soft,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Gamervision,40,While Star Soldier isnt the deepest most nuanced game available it has some pretty tight shooting and fast-paced game play. If youre that second type of gamer who just has to have the highest score you may find 8 dollars worth of game play. Otherwise save yourself some money and finger pain.
Yosumin! LIVE,Xbox 360,May-27-2009,Square Enix,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,GameSpot,55,This color-matching game is too random and shallow to entertain for long.
SingStar ABBA,PlayStation 2,Dec-2-2008,SCEE London Studio,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,IGN,55,I love SingStar but feel these artist-specific titles are missteps. Theres not enough content for the price; the scope is super-limited; and even if you love ABBA youll need ABBA-obsessed friends to have a decent party with this title.
Call of Duty: Roads to Victory,PSP,Mar-13-2007,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,GameShark,33,Doesnt feel like a true Call of Duty game. Gamers can blame Amaze if they like or the difficulty of developing a shooter on the PSP format but either way Call of Duty Roads to Victory falls short of expectations.
Wheelman,Xbox 360,Mar-24-2009,Tigon | Midway Studios - Newcastle,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Game Revolution,25,It’s like an ironic mustache or mullet. Like having a Steven Segal DVD in your collection. You’ll never get any real use out of it. You just have it in with your other games to show you friends you have a sense of humor.
Wavey The Rocket,PC,May-7-2020,UpperRoom Games Ltd,Action | General,PC Games,40,Quotation forthcoming.
Danger Zone,PlayStation 4,May-30-2017,Three Fields Entertainment,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Gaming Age,33,I have no doubt that in some alternate universe Danger Zone is absolutely awesome. After all it has a good idea at its core and its development team has shown in the past that theyre capable of pulling off that very same idea. In this universe however theres no getting around the fact that Danger Zone is quite simply terrible.
Redeemer,PC,Aug-1-2017,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,Riot Pixels,36,Awful game design meets nonsensical story. Oh and rivers of blood.
STRAFE,PC,May-9-2017,Pixel Titans,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,PLAY! Zine,30,STRAFE is a roguelike FPS that tries too hard to remind us of the good old times but since it lacks any depth and quality it fails hard on every level. The game is a mix of horrible graphics (although that was the excuse for the XX century feel) awful story (again on purpose) one of the worst AI opponents ever and questionable shooting.
Townsmen: A Kingdom Rebuilt,Switch,Nov-9-2018,HandyGames,Strategy | General | Management | Government,Switch Player,50,With a simple but competent art style Townsmen delivers a town-building simulation experience akin to classic RTSs such as Age of Empires. Less focused on combat but a bit repetitive it compensates some of its problem with a huge amount of content.
The Town of Light,PC,Feb-26-2016,LKA,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,CD-Action,35,The Town of Light reminded me of similarly short and unpleasant Neverending Nightmares. Both games tried to tackle the subject of mental illnesses and both failed utterly. [07/2016 p.51]
X-Men: The Arcade Game,PlayStation 3,Dec-14-2010,Konami,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Storms thunderthighs remain strangely alluring though. [Apr 2011 p.118]
Van Helsing,PlayStation 2,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Game Revolution,33,Rather than complement the film with some sort of stand alone side story it opts for arcade gameplay sans interesting plot depth or really anything beyond just blasting and whacking.
Mace Griffin Bounty Hunter,Xbox,Jun-20-2003,Warthog,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,Eurogamer,40,For all it brings to the table - space combat Halos shield varied levels - not one single aspect is truly worthy of praise.
Global Touring Challenge: Africa,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2002,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,50,It is without a shadow of a doubt the perfect example of the most mediocre racing game Ive ever seen. [July 2002 p.100]
WWE WrestleMania X8,GameCube,Jun-9-2002,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Gamer's Pulse,30,Lacks any great game modes the controls are wacky at times the AI needs some major work and the name just doesn’t fit.
Forever Kingdom,PlayStation 2,Jan-21-2002,From Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,The multiple-character combos are a nice touch but the execution is so poor as to make it a moot point. [Feb 2002 p.106]
Floigan Bros. Episode 1,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2001,Visual Concepts,Action | General,Electronic Gaming Monthly,17,We’re talking gameplay that swings wildly from being overly simplistic (with brain teasers that couldn’t tease a 1-year-old) to being frustratingly directionless and unintuitive. [Sept 2001 p.145]
Gradius III and IV,PlayStation 2,Nov-13-2000,KCET,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Spank!,30,A complete and utter waste of time and money for anyone who isnt a die-hard shoot em-up junky.
We Happy Few,Xbox One,Aug-10-2018,Compulsion Games,Action Adventure | General,Metro GameCentral,40,A joyless and confused mix of BioShock Fallout and Rust that wastes its intriguing setting on repetitive action and tedious survival mechanics.
Micro Machines V4,PlayStation 2,Jun-27-2006,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,This was a great game...15 years ago. The new Micro Machines fails to offer anything new or exciting to an already stale series. [Sept 2006 p.79]
Legend of Kay Anniversary,PC,Jul-27-2015,Neon Studios | Kaiko,Action Adventure | General | Linear,Metro GameCentral,50,The most peculiar HD remaster so far that offers no obvious reason for its existence or why the original was though worthy of resurrection.
Major League Baseball 2K9,Xbox 360,Mar-3-2009,2K Sports,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,Gaming Nexus,33,2k Sports swings for the fences but ultimately drops the ball.
Party Hard,PC,Aug-25-2015,Pinokl Games,Action | General,GameCritics,20,Party Hard is not a game that rewards players who take chances or attempt to learn the layout of levels since the developers randomize the stages after each failure. Trap elements items and victim gathering points change every time. Theres no value in practicing techniques when theres no guarantee players will have a chance to use them.
BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II,3DS,May-31-2011,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,GameShark,25,Likewise I wouldnt touch this game again over the higher quality Capcom and Tecmo offerings available on the same platform. Id advise other push-button martial artists to do the same.
Disgaea Infinite,PSP,Jun-8-2010,Nippon Ichi Software,Adventure | General | General | Visual Novel,Game Revolution,50,The only thing infinite about this game is how often it feels like youre running through the same situations and scenarios.
RiME,Switch,Nov-14-2017,Tantalus | Tequila Works,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,The Games Machine,40,RiME is still a wonderful game but the Switch version is a tremendous porting that can seriously ruin an otherwise unforgettable experience. You can overlook the downgrade of the resolution or even the lower graphic detail but the palette is faded the pop-in is terrible the frame rate unstable and all these combined can seriously discourage everyone.
Mercenaries Wings: The False Phoenix,Switch,Nov-8-2018,RideonJapan |Inc.,Action | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Tactics,RPG Site,50,There’s not much to engage the player here--almost everything about the game is completely average. I wouldn’t say Mercenaries Wings is a bad game it’s simply difficult to recommend spending your time playing it when there other more polished games. If you’re an SRPG nut that’s starved for new games then Mercenaries Wings might be the game you’re looking for but otherwise I’d spend your time elsewhere.
Batman: The Telltale Series,PC,Aug-2-2016,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,GamesRadar+,40,Batman: The Telltale Series squanders its potential with a messy story obsessed with retreading older Batman tales.
Alien Breed,PlayStation Vita,Feb-12-2013,Team17,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Gamers\' Temple,40,Some things get better with age but Alien Breed is not one of them.
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight,PC,Mar-16-2010,EA LA,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Game Revolution,25,Command & Conquer 4 is atrocious end of story.
The Saga of Ryzom,PC,Sep-20-2004,Nevrax,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,Computer Games Magazine,40,For a game with such amazing art direction innovative game ideas and a dedicated developer its a shame that it pimps you down unfairly and destroys your entertainment with double-digit deaths. [Feb 2005 p.69]
Mad Riders,Xbox 360,May-30-2012,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Games.cz,40,Mad Riders is an arcade racing game that is boring to death. Even though the game offers plenty of tracks modes and vehicles the actual differences are in their different colours. Quantity dominates quality and most importantly - it dominates the actual entertainment.
Need for Speed Undercover,Xbox 360,Nov-17-2008,EA Vancouver,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Game Revolution,16,Unfinished underdeveloped racing efforts like Need for Speed: Undercover leave the acrid taste of stale engine oil and greasy do-rags in my mouth. Luckily it’s nothing that a little time spent with Grid or PGR4 can’t wash away. Undercover attempts to return the series to its former glory but it’s obviously lost that loving feeling.
Warframe,PlayStation 4,Nov-12-2013,Digital Extremes,General | General | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Eurogamer,40,Its hard though to shake the feeling that the only reason this game is free to play is that nobody would pay money for something so scrappy and generic.
Ghostbusters: The Video Game,PlayStation 2,Jun-16-2009,War Drum Studios,Action | General,Gamer.nl,30,This version of Ghostbusters is a poor port of the Wii version with a plethora of technical and gameplay issues. Fans are better off picking up the game on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3.
Phantasy Star Universe,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2006,Sonic Team,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Boomtown,40,There’s just nothing there to recommend beyond a reasonably decent plot. Best thing I can suggest then is to find a detailed guide somewhere online and read the story there – you’ll have more fun and won’t waste time and money on the game.
Armored Core: For Answer,Xbox 360,Sep-16-2008,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,We accept that there’s some who’ll like this. You know who you are and you know you’re not the majority. Listen up majority it is you to whom we speak.
The friends of Ringo Ishikawa,Switch,Apr-3-2019,yeo,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Destructoid,50,The combat too can get a little confusing when a bunch of characters are on-screen. Youll end up hitting the wrong foe which then allows your intended target to get some free hits on you. The abundance of techniques doesnt add much either as the basic punch and kick combos do fine against everyone. I know this isnt meant to be specifically a beat-em-up but the gameplay feels a little basic.
Seasons After Fall,PlayStation 4,May-16-2017,Swing Swing Submarine,Action | Platformer | 2D,Destructoid,40,To put it bluntly Seasons After Fall is pleasant. A world with a great feeling experience that tends to knock you out of it when moving around. As much as I appreciate a game as relaxed as this that relaxation never quite became true enjoyment.
The Baconing,Xbox 360,Aug-31-2011,Hothead Games,Action | Role-Playing | Action RPG | Platformer | Action RPG | 3D,Armchair Empire,35,The Baconing isnt completely devoid of enjoyment; occasionally you may stumble upon a fun weapon or two such as poison arrows or a flamethrower and the experience system allows you to choose what kind of bonuses to receive with each Level Up (such as faster speed more health etc). But without the laughs to back up the mediocre gameplay not to mention the ludicrous difficulty it might be time to bring out the oversized shepherds hook and pull Deathspank off the stage.
Vikings: Wolves of Midgard,Xbox One,Mar-28-2017,Games Farm,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GamingTrend,50,As unmemorable as it was disappointing Vikings—Wolves of Midgard misses the mark. With a flat story uninteresting combat made worse by the game’s annoying exposure system and a boring environment to boot this title doesn’t compare to its many well-liked peers within the ARPG genre.
NASCAR: The Game 2013,PC,Jul-24-2013,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Stock Car,Thunderbolt,30,For some it may be enough to simply have a new Nascar experience but as a game it’s not going to hold an appeal for anyone beyond those who simply want a straightforward replication of the sport.
N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure,Xbox One,May-15-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Miscellaneous | Adventure | Puzzle | General | 3D | First-Person,EGM,35,A few interesting puzzles can’t save Nero from being an overwritten mawkish plod that runs so poorly on the Xbox One it’s tough to play without feeling sick.
Sea of Solitude,PC,Jul-5-2019,Electronic Arts | Jo-Mei Games,General | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Quarter to Three,20,I don’t mean to make light of someone who’s obviously — maybe too obviously — writing about things that make her sad. I get it. But being sad doesn’t make your poetry worth reading. I’m sorry I know that’s a dick thing to say but I’m not your therapist. I’m not even your friend. I don’t know you.
Kholat,PlayStation 4,Mar-8-2016,IMGN.PRO,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,God is a Geek,40,Grievously weighed down by its unforgiving orienteering mechanic tedious gameplay and frame-rate issues Kholat is more likely to leave you with your head aching rather than your head spinning.
The Crew,Xbox One,Dec-2-2014,Ubisoft Reflections | Ivory Tower,GT / Street | Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | Automobile,We Got This Covered,40,From the absurd handling and cheap enemy A.I. to the ugly graphics and over-reliance on microtransactions there are no shortage of problems here. Even if you are desperate for a new racer (I’m looking at you PS4 owners) I can’t justify recommending this game in its current state.
Tiger Woods PGA Tour,DS,Dec-14-2004,Sensory Sweep,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Sim | Sim,Pocket Games,30,EA tries to innovate with their first DS golf game the end result is double bogey with a penalty shot. [Spring 2005 p.63]
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,PlayStation 2,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamers Europe,35,It has a fantastic score an excellent cast and some genuinely good ideas but its inability to find balance between narration and game along with poor execution means that this is one purple headed monster you won’t want to be playing with.
Academy of Champions: Soccer,Wii,Nov-3-2009,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,Nintendo Gamer,36,Worse than Peles impotence advert. [Dec 2009 p.67]
Moons of Madness,Xbox One,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,Windows Central,40,Lovecraft fans will have to look elsewhere. While Moons of Madness has some exciting ideas and goes a long way on its premise alone the story is too dense and the gameplay is too simple to make it worth your time... unless you need to kill five hours.
Sleep Tight,Switch,Jul-26-2018,We Are Fuzzy,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,TheSixthAxis,40,Sleep Tight has some very interesting ideas but unfortunately fails to captilise on them and falls into the depths of mediocrity.
Disney/Pixar Ratatouille,PSP,Jun-26-2007,Locomotive Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,1UP,50,Ratatouille is otherwise a very charming game...when youre not playing it. Its biggest failings are in the end the built-in limitations of the hardware and the genre that most developers keep trying to superimpose -- sloppily -- on top of it.
Batman Begins,PlayStation 2,Jun-14-2005,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Computer Games Magazine,30,Youve basically got a barely interactive Splinter Cell for Dummies. [Sept 2005 p.91]
Carve,Xbox,Feb-24-2004,Argonaut Games,Driving | Racing | Snow / Water,TotalGames.net,40,Its a great shame but playing Carve is like playing Paint Dry Simulator on Xbox... all the wall textures are there the gloss of the emulsion - you can even see the brush strokes in the drying paint - it just doesnt add up to a hell of a lot of fun.
Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction,Xbox,Jul-30-2003,Zono Inc.,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi,Yahoo!,40,The game mechanics are so badly crippled that it probably doesnt even deserve to be called a strategy game.
X-Squad,PlayStation 2,Oct-23-2000,Electronic Arts,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,GamePen,40,Its merely a re-run of countless action games that have come before it: a futuristic setting with lots of weapons shooting and running around... but not much after that.
Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault,PlayStation 3,Nov-27-2012,Insomniac Games,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,EGM,45,Aside from some moments of classic Ratchet & Clank humor Full Frontal Assault fails both as a tower defense game and as a means to hold fans of the franchise over until Insomniac delivers a new mainline title.
Yakuza: Dead Souls,PlayStation 3,Mar-13-2012,Ryu ga Gotoku Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,Gaming Age,42,I dont feel like Yakuza: Dead Souls is a game that anyone really needs to play even if youre a pretty hardcore fan of the series. The action is such a departure from the series and handled so poorly that it literally turns you off of wanting to do anything but the non-combat side stuff found throughout.
ADR1FT,PC,Mar-28-2016,Three One Zero,Action | Action Adventure | General | Survival,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,Visually beautiful trip to the ruined space station which unfortunately gets boring soon. You won´t be killed by lack of oxygen but mainly by boredom and frustration from the lack of content. [Issue#263]
Chaos Wars,PlayStation 2,May-30-2008,Idea Factory,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Playstation: The Official Magazine (US),40,Chaos Wars might draw in some--like fans of the obscure games its based on especially those who long for the days of hand-drawn characters and tiny battlefields--but its old-school aesthetic isnt enough to make up for the lackluster production values and uninspired game play. [Aug 2008 p.82]
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing III,PC,May-22-2015,NeocoreGames,Role-Playing | Action RPG,LEVEL (Czech Republic),40,It should be labeled: only for core fans. Third installment of Van Helsing is not entirely bad but it’s average and completely misses its mark..
Super Lucky's Tale,Xbox One,Nov-7-2017,Playful Corp.,2D | Action | Platformer | 3D,Metro GameCentral,30,Bland boring and badly made – returning to the bad old days of low rent mascot platformers is not a good way to demonstrate the power of the Xbox One X.
Cold War,PC,Sep-27-2005,Mindware Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Computer Games Magazine,40,Silly balking chuckle-inducing for the wrong reasons Cold War is the sort of pretender-to-stealth-throne that makes you squint pinch your nose and wave your hand rapidly in front of your face.[Feb 2006 p.59]
Snooker 19,Switch,Aug-23-2019,Lab42,Sports | Individual | Billiards,Pure Nintendo,40,If you want to be able to play a fully-licensed snooker game anywhere and at any time on your Nintendo Switch then this would be a suitable option albeit a boring one. If you aren’t in need of portable snooker-gameplay then you are probably better off going to your local bowling alley and/or sports bar.
Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs. Sasuke,DS,Nov-12-2010,Takara Tomy,Action | General | General | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gaming Nexus,42,Theres nothing broken about Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs Sasuke but there isnt anything to make it stand out in a crowd either. Youre better off getting your ninja fix elsewhere.
Officers,PC,Jul-14-2009,3A Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,GameSpot,55,Officers boasts some interesting strategic considerations including a focus on reconnaissance and realistic supply concerns which have been lacking in recent RTS games. However the practically nonexistent multiplayer the punishing difficulty the exhaustingly long missions and a few other annoyances make it a difficult game to recommend.
Zombie Driver HD,Xbox 360,Oct-17-2012,EXOR Studios,Action | General | General,Games Master UK,56,Its potential is never fully realised. [Jan 2013 p.79]
Crash Twinsanity,PlayStation 2,Sep-28-2004,Traveller's Tales,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gamestyle,30,Full completion of the game takes time and whilst there are some nice extras on the DVD to unlock you cant get around the fact that its time that could be spent doing something far far better.
MX vs. ATV All Out: Anniversary Edition,Xbox One,Feb-26-2019,THQ Nordic,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,GameGrin,55,Unless you’re a huge huge fan of the series then I wouldnt go all out on this one as the developers certainly didn’t.
Darksiders III,PlayStation 4,Nov-27-2018,Gunfire Games | THQ Nordic,Action Adventure | Open-World,Game Rant,20,The game is a nightmare to play through with an unlikable protagonist a chugging frame rate and a mountain of bugs. It’s completely and utterly broken but even when it works (which is almost never) it amounts to nothing more than a below average hack-and-slash with some decent puzzles.
RymdResa,PC,Aug-20-2015,Morgondag,Role-Playing | General,Digitally Downloaded,50,With time and patches this could be a must play but as it is I can only cautiously recommend RymdResa as a game with fascinating ideas and inconsistent execution.
Hydrophobia: Prophecy,PC,May-9-2011,Dark Energy Digital,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,PC Gamer,39,Hydrophobia Prophecy suffers from more than a fear of water: Its also afflicted with acute blandness brain dead AI and chronic backtracking. [Sept 2011 p.73]
Intellivision Lives!,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2003,Realtime Associates,Miscellaneous | Compilation,G4 TV,40,The game tries to adapt the various keypad functions and you can use an on-screen virtual Intellivision paddle but neither works as well as the original hardwired controllers did.
Worms: Open Warfare,DS,Mar-22-2006,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | Fantasy | Artillery,PALGN,40,Ultimately Worms: Open Warfare feels really undercooked. Everybody knows that there’s potential for a good Worms game on the DS – you’ve got the Wi-Fi online play stylus allowing for mouse-like precision and all of that jazz but Open Warfare doesn’t exactly make good use of any of these features. Regardless of that the biggest insult is that the title can’t even hold up against its ageing predecessors – it really feels like the product was slapped together and shipped out as cheaply as possible.
Storm,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,EKO Software,Miscellaneous | General | General,Games Master UK,44,An extreme exercise in patience. [Sept 2013 p.71]
TNA iMPACT!,PlayStation 3,Sep-9-2008,Midway Studios - Los Angeles,Action | Sports | Fighting | Fighting | Individual | Wrestling | Combat | Wrestling,GameShark,33,Remember when Blitz and NBA Jam ruled supreme and we all got our first taste of the notorious Midway Comeback AI? I’m sad to say that a close relative of that AI seems to be present here.
RPG Maker Fes,3DS,Jun-27-2017,Jupiter Corporation | Kadokawa,Role-Playing | General,NintendoWorldReport,50,Ultimately it’s hard for me to recommend RPG Maker Fes to anyone but the most hardcore of RPG fans that have always dreamed of creating their own game. You’ll certainly be limited by the tools (or lack thereof) available here and the lack of a meaningful tutorial may hinder all but the most patient of designers. RPG Maker Fes feels like an incomplete product like a beginner sewer’s kit that was shipped with only one color of thread and without instructions. You can definitely make an RPG if you’re patient enough but it’s unlikely to come close to what you envisioned when you began which is likely to leave you unsatisfied.
nail'd,Xbox 360,Nov-30-2010,Techland,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,games(TM),30,Theres nothing in Naild that is outright offensive but the sloppiness of its execution damn-near eradicates any fun that could have been gleaned from it. [Issue#105 p.122]
Killer Is Dead,PlayStation 3,Aug-27-2013,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameCritics,40,Between the tedious levels incoherent story and offputting gigolo missions I found very little to appreciate about Killer is Dead. I grew quite tired of the shallow game design and weak attempts to distract me from its vacuous lack of substance and put the game down before rolling credits.
Arc Rise Fantasia,Wii,Jul-27-2010,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,The A.V. Club,42,When the reward for beating the next boss is just more bland gameplay it just isnt worth the effort.
Exit DS,DS,Nov-5-2008,Moss,Action | Puzzle | General | General,Modojo,40,With over 100 levels and Wi-Fi functionality via leaderboards Exit DS isnt totally without merit.
Track Lab,PlayStation 4,Aug-21-2018,Sony Interactive Entertainment,Action | Rhythm | Music,PlayStation LifeStyle,40,If you want a game there are better music puzzlers out there with heaps more content and if you’re looking for someplace to fire up your musical chops there are actual music production tools that will serve you in better ways than Track Lab’s isolated creation mode.
Rainbow Skies,PlayStation 4,Jun-26-2018,SideQuest Studios,Role-Playing | General,Cubed3,40,Rainbow Skies is not only uninspired it feels almost like a cheap nostalgia cash-in for JRPG enthusiasts. The characters are generally annoying and mostly one-dimensional and the writing is quite poor and riddled with syntax issues. The explorative nature of the game is something that players might be drawn to but thats not enough to carry the significantly weaker portions of the game. The combat system is sort of cute in its simplicity but its not unique enough to keep players invested throughout all the annoying little quirks that fill up the majority of Rainbow Skies
King Oddball,Xbox One,Sep-9-2016,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Action,XBLA Fans,40,This game can be fun but not for long periods of time. It is more likely a game you would buy play once then forget about until you are looking through your game library because you ran out of storage. Ive said this before and I will say it again: puzzle games should require patience and skill rather than focus on speed and luck. King Oddballs enormous amount of levels and chuckle-worthy achievements just dont cut it.
Thor: God of Thunder,DS,May-3-2011,WayForward,Action | General | General,Game Revolution,42,Tacked-on touch screen support.
Cranium Kabookii,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,Cheat Code Central,52,As a video game Cranium Kabookii offers an experience that cant even match that of its low-tech predecessor. The poor control and repetitive gameplay coupled with the underwhelming graphics and sound make for an experience thats better left off of the video game console and back on to your familys dining-room table.
Star Trek: Tactical Assault,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Quicksilver Software,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,Its not as bad as most Trek titles but TA fails to boldly go where no game has gone before. [Jan 2007 p.92]
Avatar: The Last Airbender,DS,Oct-10-2006,TOSE,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,57,The Avatars DS debut serves up an engaging story and some slick 3D visuals but its otherwise just another mediocre brawler.
Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue,GameCube,Aug-16-2005,Xpec,Action Adventure | Fantasy,G4 TV,40,If you cant go anywhere without your Chococat pencil case go ahead and pick up Roller Rescue. Were sure youll manage to delude yourself into thinking its great.
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,PC,Nov-10-2004,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Computer Games Magazine,50,The sort of game that screams average! at every turn. [March 2005 p.83]
Wrath Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Feb-10-2004,Double Helix Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,Too simple for strategy fans and too complex for fighting fans. The occasionally interesting creature design and accompanying animation cant save this one from its cliched premise uninteresting gameplay and interminable load times. [Mar 2004 p.103]
RoadKill,GameCube,Oct-30-2003,Terminal Reality,Driving | Car Combat,Nintendo Power,26,A mediocre mess of a vehicular battle game that contains an excessive amount of violence and strong language. [Feb 2004 p.150]
Pro Rally,GameCube,Nov-11-2002,Ubisoft,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,G4 TV,40,Visually the game has a rather muddy and faded look -- it just isnt up to snuff. Although car damage can affect driving none of it shows up in the visuals.
Superman: Shadow of Apokolips,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2002,Atari,Action Adventure | Fantasy,PSM Magazine,40,Repetitive missions bad flight controls and too many robots make this game quite non-super. [Dec 2002 p.60]
Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates,Game Boy Advance,Apr-30-2002,RFX Interactive,Action | Platformer | 2D,Nintendo Power,56,With fairly typical side-scrolling action the game feels all the more grand thanks to its amazing look and magical settings. [May 2002 p.140]
Wild Wild Racing,PlayStation 2,Oct-25-2000,Rage Software,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Hot Games,50,Its all the worst traits of arcade racers thrown together exaggerated to the point of grotesqueness and then slapped into a game thats at best a visual mixed bag.
Wolfenstein: Youngblood,PlayStation 4,Jul-26-2019,MachineGames,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Gaming Age,16,At $30 I expected a short but dense Wolfenstein experience with two new protagonists and a tangible narrative thread connecting them to the original games their father B.J. Blazkowicz. What we got was a horrible imitation of the rest of the series complete with an absolutely senseless plot unacceptably bad and annoying characters and joyless combat. I find that a weak plot can be forgiven if gameplay is flawless and satisfying and sometimes weaker gameplay can be ignored in favor of an incredible story but you cannot botch BOTH aspects and expect people to like your game.
Juiced,PC,Jun-13-2005,Juice Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Computer Games Magazine,50,THQ salvaged the wreckage polished the package and let the game out of hte garage where it debuts with middling success. [Oct 2005 p.68]
The Adventures of Tintin: The Game,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2011,Ubisoft Montpellier,Adventure | General | General,1UP,25,I understand that the game is meant for a younger audience but there are quite literally hundreds of other titles out there that provide a far more enjoyable experience.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,PC,Jun-25-2007,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Boomtown,40,Its a shame really as EA could have done a whole lot better. The control system could be a lot better the animation could be better and the cut-scenes could be better.
Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon,PlayStation 3,Jul-1-2011,Vicious Cycle,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Gaming Age,33,My suggestion would be to skip this title entirely unless youre particularly hard up for some new EDF action.
Dead Island: Definitive Collection,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,Techland,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,A festering corpse given an unnecessary kiss of life. [Aug 2016 p.93]
The Witch and the Hundred Knight: Revival Edition,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameCritics,30,The Witch and the Hundred Knight isn’t a good game by any means. It has an impenetrable equipment system lackluster combat with no other gameplay mechanics and a story that only gets good if players consult an FAQ.
198X,PC,Jun-20-2019,Hi-Bit Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Platformer | Party / Minigame | 2D,The Indie Game Website,50,198X is aesthetically pleasing. Its bright accomplished pixel-art and synth-fueled music capture its desired tone perfectly. But if that’s all that 198X is I’m not sure it’s worth anyone’s time. Even if you are interested in a pretty but empty 80s nostalgia drip I’d suggest looking elsewhere; there are plenty of options.
The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer,Xbox,Nov-1-2005,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Gaming Age,50,While the game doesnt do much in the way of gameplay the presentation makes up for it.
Suikoden IV,PlayStation 2,Jan-11-2005,KCET,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Game Revolution,33,An uninspired unnecessary chapter in the Suikoden series. The game’s greatest failing is its incredible mediocrity.
Supreme Ruler: Cold War,PC,Jul-19-2011,BattleGoat Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Gamekult,50,Quotation forthcoming.
This Is the Police,PlayStation 4,Mar-22-2017,Weappy Studio,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life | Career,GameCritics,40,Overall This Is The Police is a somewhat enjoyable strategy/time management title although the story felt like wasted time since I never grew connected to the characters or the plot and it had no real bearing on play. With more weight given to the plot and better integration into the game overall this sad tale of a man slowly sinking to the bottom would have come together into something fascinating. As it stands the strategic parts can’t save the experience overall and the end result is a title that feels only half-done. Ultimately This is the Police ended up being a game to kill time with not one to lose time on.
Neon Chrome,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,10tons Entertainment | 10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Impulsegamer,44,With a time consuming upgrade system and lack of variation in the levels despite the procedural generation Neon Chrome is forgive the obvious pun ultimately neither bright or polished enough.
FIFA Street 2,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Game Revolution,42,Even after a sequel this Street still falls flat on its asphalt.
Fallout 76: Wastelanders,PlayStation 4,Apr-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Metro GameCentral,50,Wastelanders transforms Fallout 76 from a technical and conceptual disaster to a merely flawed online experience which has a far better online community than it deserves.
Super Bomberman R,Xbox One,Jun-12-2018,Konami,Puzzle | Action | Arcade,Digital Chumps,40,Overall I think Super Bomberman R falls short as a complete package. The single-player while reaching for something a bit different with level design (and it achieves it) falls short with uninteresting bosses and slow enemies. The online play of the game is only good on a local level while the actual online gaming experience is hindered by the lack of players and atrocious delay.
Cubemen 2,Wii U,Sep-4-2014,3 Sprockets,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | General | Defense,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,50,If the offline community ever picks up wed expect to slap another 20% on that score. Until then steer clear. [Christmas 2014 p.95]
Necrovision,PC,May-18-2009,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Absolute Games,33,At first NecroVisioN seems like a fun game. But when you realize that the 1237th encounter with monsters is the same as the 561st and that melee is just a polygon mess all the fun goes away.
Worms Forts: Under Siege,PlayStation 2,Mar-15-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,PSX Extreme,41,The game has so many technical flaws that you simply cannot enjoy the experience.
Dirty Bomb,PC,Jun-1-2015,Splash Damage,Shooter | Modern | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameSpot,50,While Brink sits in history as a game that tripped on its path to fame Dirty Bomb will be fortunate to be remembered at all.
World Poker Tour,Xbox,Oct-18-2005,2K Sports,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,GameSpy,40,All in all WPT is not a bad title but $20 can get you into a couple of real tournaments online. Tournaments where you could actually make money.
Moons of Madness,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2020,Rock Pocket Games | Dreamloop Games,Action Adventure | Survival,Gameblog.fr,30,If the atmosphere of Moons of Madness is rather well posed successful through its story and its compartmentalized environments borrows paranoia any Lovecraftian in Martian confinement difficult not to go around in circles quickly the fault of a relative monotony in the course disappointing or agreed history and puzzles.
Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,PlayStation 3,Oct-26-2010,LucasArts,Action | General | General,DarkZero,40,The original Force Unleashed shot for the stars and fell short but at least you could commend it for trying. Force Unleashed 2 feels sterile and barren in comparison refusing to try for anything spectacular and managing to reuse and recycle its few good ideas countless times over its short run.
Lost Grimoires: Stolen Kingdom,Xbox One,Apr-28-2017,Artifex Mundi,Puzzle | Hidden Object,GameGrin,55,The pros just barely outweigh the cons for me in this puzzle game. Since the puzzles are less than impressive and the animations seem to have taken a step back its only because the addition of the alchemy minigame and the extra easy completion that I would recommend this game. Without a doubt this is one of the most forgettable Artifex Mundi titles.
Resident Evil 6,Xbox One,Mar-29-2016,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,Gaming Age,25,If you are hell bent on grabbing RE6 wait for a price drop. $20 is even too steep in my opinion.
Godzilla: Save the Earth,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Fighting | 3D,G4 TV,40,A decent party game with a great cast of cheesy giant monsters but its just not scaly or radioactive enough to command much respect.
FIFA Street 3,Xbox 360,Feb-18-2008,EA Canada,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Arcade | Arcade,G4 TV,40,A sequel isn’t supposed to be softer poorer slower weaker but that sadly sums up FIFA Street 3s questionable content.
Finding Nemo,Xbox,May-9-2003,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,40,Its not very complex or original with little to the action beyond simple objective completion and ABC linearity while more mature players may gag at the cutesiness of it all.
InnerSpace,Switch,Jan-16-2018,PolyKnight Games,Simulation | Flight | Civilian,TheSixthAxis,50,InnerSpace manages to craft a bright bizarre and beautiful world that is probably the best example of the phrase eye candy I can think of. Unfortunately the act of exploring and navigating that serene majestic world often times felt like a headache. The poor frame rate on Switch and no clear horizons made flying and swimming in InnerSpace far less enjoyable than the idea of those actions ever was.
Dragon's Prophet,PC,Aug-13-2013,Runewaker Entertainment,Role-Playing | General | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy,IGN,51,With dragon taming action combat and robust skill and housing systems theres an enjoyable experience at the core of Dragons Prophet that never manages to break free of the dull environment and grinding pace that surrounds it.
NBA 09 The Inside,PlayStation 3,Oct-7-2008,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Gaming Nexus,33,There are just too many problems with the basic game of basketball in NBA 09 to really recommend this above the other games out there.
Shark Tale,PC,Sep-27-2004,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Computer Games Magazine,30,The biggest problems are the shockingly short play time and repetitive gameplay. [Jan 2005 p.73]
X-Men: Next Dimension,GameCube,Oct-15-2002,Exakt,Action | Fighting | 3D,Play Magazine,40,Besides a real lack of polish on the models and backgrounds in Dimension it just feels mediocre when stacked against competition like DOA Kakuto Chojin and MK Deadly Alliance. [Jan 2003 p.81]
Alpha Protocol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Western-Style,GameCritics,10,Flawed in its conception impoverished in its design and thoroughly inept in its execution Alpha Protocol is an unmitigated disaster
Spectrobes,DS,Mar-6-2007,Jupiter Corporation,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,netjak,42,While filled with numerous excellent ideas the mish-mash handling of the development destroyed the potential.
PixelJunk 4am,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Q-Games,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Music Maker | Music Maker | Application,Play UK,40,Its a brief distraction and sometimes interesting if you get to watch some kid in Moscow making the most beautiful sounds youve ever heard but that doesnt exactly happen all the time.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India,PlayStation 4,Jan-13-2016,Ubisoft | Climax Studios,General | Action Adventure | Linear,Push Square,50,The dialogue is dull the art style doesnt look good at all and the game just doesnt have much appeal. Its certainly not bad its just so bang average that youll have seen it all before.
Airheart: Tales of Broken Wings,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2018,Blindflug Studios,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameCritics,35,I wanted to like Airheart. The concept of a roguelike with air combat exploring worlds and creating my own plane is a good one. Unfortunately buggy game mechanics lackluster crafting and the awful grind for money shoots this little ship out of the sky.
DarkStar One: Broken Alliance,Xbox 360,Jul-13-2010,Gaming Minds Studios,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,MondoXbox,50,DarkStar One fails in every aspect even if we have to acknowledge it the merit of having introduced some potentially interesting mechanics.
Big Bumpin',Xbox 360,Nov-19-2006,Blitz Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,NTSC-uk,30,Again the game features multiplayer over Live but suffers from very few people playing online and is solely populated by prepubescents with limited vocabularies that consist of nothing but insults.
Citadel: Forged with Fire,Xbox One,Nov-1-2019,Blue Isle Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,God is a Geek,50,There is potentially a fun game underneath but Citadel: Forged with Fire is mired in a relentless time-draining loop of meaningless activity.
Dogos,Xbox One,Sep-7-2016,INTERNET URL S.A.,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Brash Games,50,The gameplay can be as tight as you like but if there’s nothing to inspire me to boot the game back up of an evening well… OPQAM I’m afraid you’re missing the mark.
NBA 08,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2007,SCEA San Diego Studios,Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Sim | Sim,Gaming Age,33,Sony just let this one go it isn’t worth the embarrassment.
Windlands,PlayStation 4,Oct-25-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,God is a Geek,50,Windlands is a pretty great idea that could have been an essential PSVR title had more thought been put into its traversal.
Major League Baseball 2K8,Wii,Mar-3-2008,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Team | Baseball | Sim | Sim,1UP,50,MLB 2K8 on the Wii just didnt sparkle enough to make me overly enthusiastic. Its a fun novelty play but Im taking a Cubs fan-style wait till next year approach with what could very well blossom into a must-play by next season.
The World Next Door,Switch,Mar-27-2019,Rose City Games,Action Adventure | General,GamingTrend,50,The World Next Door is an ambitious action-puzzle game with some interesting narrative and RPG elements but unfortunately wears itself thin trying too much with too little.
Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,PlayStation 4,Feb-24-2015,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,The Jimquisition,30,Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is everything a Dynasty Warriors hater thinks about the series made real. It’s a contemptuously assembled recycling project and I’m sick of it.
The Immortals of Terra: A Perry Rhodan Adventure,PC,Jul-3-2008,Braingame,Adventure | 3D | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Third-Person,GameShark,25,Like all games based on successful licenses from the written world it’s a shame to see Immortals of Terra struggle so much in terms of overall direction. I’m sure in the vast Perry Rhodan landscape there’s more than enough material to make several blockbuster titles yet this game fails to even make it out of the starting block.
NBA Live 07,PlayStation 2,Sep-25-2006,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Sim,Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK,40,The heavier focus on animations makes the controls feel sticky - press for a pass a rebound or a block and it might not happen. [Nov 2006 p.103]
Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings,PSP,Jun-9-2009,Amaze Entertainment | Amaze,Action | Action Adventure | General | General | Linear,Game Chronicles,52,It seemed more like a collection of exercises or training scenarios rather than a flowing adventure.
Eragon,DS,Nov-14-2006,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Action RPG | General | Fantasy | Beat-'Em-Up | Japanese-Style | 3D,Game Revolution,25,If you’re wondering what it would be like to ride on the back of a giant dragon crushing those who would dare to oppose you go out and rent The Neverending Story. You’ll have a better time than you would playing Eragon.
Sniper Elite III,Xbox One,Jul-1-2014,Rebellion,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic,Pure Xbox,50,Sniper Elite 3 is an average game. The sneaking around hiding scouting and tactical aspects are very enjoyable. But it gets repetitive pretty fast especially when the actual gameplay and the enemies dont really change.
Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines,PSP,Nov-17-2009,Griptonite Games,Action Adventure | Historic | Historic | Open-World,GameShark,25,Simply put there are too many negatives here and too many other excellent action games on the PSP to justify spending time with this jumbled mess. This is one set of memories best left forgotten.
Penny-Punching Princess,Switch,Apr-3-2018,Nippon Ichi Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameCritics,40,I appreciated that Penny-Punching Princess brought some new spins to the action-RPG genre and using money as a tool to fight is a fairly novel idea that could be explored more. The calculator is also a thematically brilliant idea in a game about capitalism and debt. However the combat mechanics are problematic and play falls prey to unnecessary frustration and repetition.
Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche,Switch,Apr-1-2020,WayForward,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Horizontal,Switch Player,40,Cat Girl Without Salad: Amuse-Bouche originated as a joke but ultimately ends up as a bore. Yes there’s some fun to be found within those two ends of the spectrum but those moments are fleeting and never quite justify your time spent with it.
The Godfather II,PC,Apr-7-2009,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Adventure | Third-Person | Historic | Linear | Open-World | Modern,Absolute Games,38,Establishing a new Family is a hard undertaking… and a tedious chore. Imagine spending 10+ hours on taking over one building after another! In GTA: San Andreas and The Godfather this occupation was but a side attraction; here it is everything.
Bounty Hounds,PSP,Sep-13-2006,Xpec,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GamesRadar+,30,With insanely repetitive mindless action and completely unengaging character progression Bounty Hounds withers and dies within its first hour.
