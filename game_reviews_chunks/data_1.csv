Don't be fooled by Brotherhood's cunningly familiar disguise. Mark it as a fresh target pounce and take it down. [January 2011 p66]

Pikmin 2,GameCube,Aug-30-2004,Nintendo,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,Stuff,100,Flat-out weird does not begin to describe this highly addictive title.

A fat little purple child with a flower budding out of his forehead.
Okami HD,PlayStation 3,Oct-30-2012,HexaDrive,Fantasy | Fantasy | Action Adventure | General,Gaming Age,100,Overall Ōkami HD is an experience that should not be missed.

Sid Meier's Civilization V,PC,Sep-21-2010,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | Historic | Historic | 4X,The Escapist,100,My favorite Civilization to date.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2012,Firaxis Games,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Tactics,Toronto Sun,100,By virtue of how it stokes more parts of my brain than any game of the past decade I’m inclined to consider XCOM: Enemy Unknown one of the most important titles of this generation.
