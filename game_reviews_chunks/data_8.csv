Nine Parchments,PlayStation 4,Dec-12-2017,Frozenbyte | Inc.,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Video Chums,81,If youre looking for a cooperative twin-stick shooter then you cant do much better than Nine Parchments. The fantastical world and challenging yet rewarding gameplay is perfect for having a magical time with a few chums by your side.
Batman: The Enemy Within - Episode 2: The Pact,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Telltale Games,Adventure | Point-and-Click,PlayStation LifeStyle,85,The Pact is filled with uncomfortable moments that force the player to choose between the right thing and their cover. It also makes important moves to flesh out the season’s story arc and ends with an awesome teaser for episode three. Telltale Games is on a roll this season and The Enemy Within continues to be some of the developer’s best work.
How We Soar,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Penny Black Studios,Action | General,Push Square,80,Some minor iffy moments aside How We Soar is a beautifully relaxing game with tight presentation and some sound controls. A lovely concept thats really well executed this is another wonderful example of why virtual reality gaming represents the way forward and you should certainly check it out if you havent done so already.
Scratches,PC,Mar-8-2006,Nucleosys,Adventure | General | General | Point-and-Click,Just Adventure,100,They have really pulled out all the stops with their first effort and created one classic piece of Adventure gaming. Just don’t get too used to that luxury called sleep.
Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge,PlayStation 3,Apr-2-2013,Team Ninja,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Digital Chumps,84,Razors Edge mixes up tradition in the Ninja Gaiden franchise enough to make it a worthy purchase. A great story (even with action cliches) gameplay improvements more dismemberments and online modes. Problems with the camera glitches and invisible walls still plague the series. At $40 there is plenty of value to consider this worthwhile.
PaRappa the Rapper,PSP,Jul-17-2007,Epics,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Play UK,88,Retains all the charm it had ten years ago. [Issue#155 p.84]
DreamWorks Voltron VR Chronicles,PlayStation 4,Sep-26-2017,Digital Domain,Action | General,GamingTrend,80,It would have been very easy for Digital Domain to make a low-effort Voltron knockoff but instead Voltron VR Chronicles feels like a small slice of the show brought to life. While it is a little short and the interactivity is somewhat basic if you are a fan this game is a must have. Next time just let us form Voltron and give us sword and shield VR controls to take out the next episode’s Robeast!
Still Life 2,PC,Aug-11-2009,GameCo,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,91,Still Life 2 despite its many faults draws you in puts you through the ringer and then spits you out like a wad of used gum at the end. I cant say its a great game -- too flawed and at times annoying for that -- but it does deliver the goods.
Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches,PC,Oct-5-2008,Arberth Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern | Modern,IGN,75,In spite of a few missteps Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches is a good-looking entertaining and well-made game especially considering the size of the dev team. Its the perfect title for people who dig history mystery and the paranormal not to mention people who like to think when they game.
Shadowrun,PC,May-29-2007,FASA Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,NTSC-uk,90,Underneath the hood is a well-honed constantly surprising beast and one that isn’t purely for FPS fans thanks to a generous degree of auto-aim that places much of the emphasis on tactics and intelligent usage of the tools at your disposal.
Sniper Elite III,PlayStation 4,Jul-1-2014,Rebellion,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Historic,IGN,82,Sniper Elite IIIs open level designs and objectives pack in more than enough variety and stealthy tension to counterbalance its thin story and shaky enemy intelligence and experimenting with its explosive traps is almost as fun as popping skulls with a sniper rifle.
Outward,PC,Mar-26-2019,Nine Dots Studio,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | General | Survival | Open-World,PC Gamer,89,Outward is harsh and occasionally frustrating but it does what so few games do. It requires you to put real thought into the choices you make and it makes those choices feel like they really matter. Most of all it makes you approach each and every encounter as if your life depended on it—even though you never die.
The Town of Light,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,LKA Interactive | LKA,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Digitally Downloaded,100,I cannot thank the developer enough for The Town of Light. Not only are we beginning to acknowledge the injustices our ancestors committed we are exploring how to prevent it from happening again by telling these important stories instead of burying them.
DOOM 3 BFG Edition,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,id Software,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Compilation | First-Person | Sci-Fi,PSX-Sense.nl,85,Doom 3 is an old game and it definitely shows its age. If you however are willing to look past that obvious defect this game will prove that it is still just as nerve-wracking as it ever was.
Gravel,PlayStation 4,Feb-27-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Wccftech,80,While Gravel has issues like strange collisions cars literally merging into each other and some issues with shadows there is a lot to say about it. Theres a wide variety of racing types tracks and cars to use. Almost everything is fast paced and entertaining and simply gratifying. Simply put Gravel is a very good arcade style racing game and Milestones best game yet.
Azkend 2: The World Beneath,Xbox One,May-3-2016,10tons Ltd | 10tons,Puzzle | Matching,Brash Games,80,These minor wrinkles aside Azkend 2: The World Beneath is a great match 3 game from a developer that clearly understands the genre and knows how to give gamers what they want. It’s well worth the asking price and definitely worth your time.
Turok Remastered,PC,Dec-17-2015,Night Dive Studios,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,80,Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is an intriguing walk down memory lane and Night Dive Studios have done their usual good job of optimizing it for modern hardware. That said Turok hasn’t aged very well at all and there are some inherent flaws that keep the original from being as fun as the sequels.
White Day: A Labyrinth Named School,PlayStation 4,Aug-22-2017,ROIGAMES Inc.,Action Adventure | Survival,Digitally Downloaded,90,Yes White Day is an older game but as far as the horror genre goes and how its evolved into something I place little value in that’s actually a benefit. Given how few people have even known what this game is to date the extra exposure that it will get from a re-release will mean that hopefully a new legion of fans will discover it because it does deserve that. It’s a masterpiece in building tension and in the way that it plays within the classical approach to horror without relying on jump scares and endless bloodshed.
The Bradwell Conspiracy,PlayStation 4,Oct-8-2019,Bossa Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Playstation Official Magazine UK,80,Although it’s a bit buggy (we had to reload a few checkpoints to progress) it’s no secret that this will be five to six hours of your time well spent. [Issue#169 p.92]

Wakeboarding Unleashed Featuring Shaun Murray,Game Boy Advance,Nov-10-2003,Small Rockets,Sports | Alternative | Wakeboarding,Gamer's Pulse,80,Excellent controls and a streamlined interface make playing a breeze on the smaller system. Unfortunately the game lacks the variety and length of gameplay that its big brother has.
Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters,Game Boy Advance,Feb-12-2003,Konami,Miscellaneous | Card Battle,GameSpy,90,After finally learning and understanding the nuances of the game I was hooked on one of the deepest GBA titles available. The game has its flaws but the plusses clearly outweigh the minuses.
Dragon Ball Z: Budokai,PlayStation 2,Dec-3-2002,Dimps Corporation,Action | Fighting | 3D,Cinescape,91,A Dragonball fan’s dream. It is the first true American game based on the series and Infogrames really came through on this one.

RedCard 20-03,Xbox,Jun-24-2002,Point of View,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GameZone,76,It’s almost mind boggling how the opponent can easily deflect your super power kicks but totally not catch the weaker shots you happen to unleash.
Heroes Chronicles: Warlords of the Wasteland,PC,Sep-27-2000,3DO,Strategy | General | General,Happy Puppy,75,The game sounds better than it looks.
X: Beyond the Frontier,PC,Jan-26-2000,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Combat,ActionTrip,81,Play it patiently explore fight and enjoy... It just might do the trick before the heavy hitters like Starlancer and Freelancer arrive.
The LEGO NINJAGO Movie Video Game,PlayStation 4,Sep-22-2017,TT Games,Action Adventure | General | Linear,GameGrin,85,The LEGO Ninjago Movie Videogame stands out from other LEGO games not for the huge game changes but for the little additions that are often unappreciated. I thoroughly enjoyed this title and I am looking forward to playing more.
Technic Beat,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Arika,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,eToychest,85,An extraordinary addition to the rhythm game genre. It offers simple pick-up-and-play mechanics that are easy to get into and significantly more difficult to put down.
UFO: Aftershock,PC,Nov-23-2005,Altar Interactive,Strategy | Turn-Based | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,eToychest,92,Aftershock is a very difficult but fun strategy title that marries strategic and tactical portions which are both compelling and fully-developed as well as an important RPG system which also interconnects quite well with the other portions of the game.
NASCAR '14,PlayStation 3,Feb-18-2014,Eutechnyx,GT / Street | Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | Stock Car | Automobile,Game Over Online,75,NASCAR 14 improves on past iterations mostly by creating an on-track racing experience that feels much more authentic and engaging that any NASCAR game to date.
Railworks 3: Train Simulator 2012,PC,Sep-23-2011,RailSimulator.com,Simulation | Train | Vehicle | Train,GamingXP,80,A great way to try your hand at driving a train. Unfortunately load times are long and DLCs all cost extra but optional simplified controls and a great look with many details and weather effects make this a good game. If you like trains but cant or wont go for a miniature train this simulation is for you.
Real Heroes: Firefighter,Wii,Aug-4-2009,Epicenter Studios,Action | Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,Kombo,80,Yes Real Heroes is a little rough around the edges but when you are in the thick of gameplay that wont matter as you get pulled into the world of firefighting.
The Thin Silence,PC,Apr-27-2018,TwoPM Studios,Adventure | General,The Games Machine,75,The Thin Silence is a charming narrative adventure filled with puzzles on the lines of Limbo and Inside. Tw PM was courage was courageous in dealing with issues such as depression and the socio-political issue but the experience is sometimes a little repetitive and frustrating.
Neon Chrome,Switch,Oct-12-2017,10tons,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,GameGrin,85,Neon Chrome is a brilliant title that has plenty of content packed into it with well-designed gameplay mechanics at work to give players a solid title. Though playing in docked mode has a number of minor issues that can be overlooked the game is a blast to play in handheld mode. If you are looking for an engaging and challenging title you and pick up and play on the go then look no further than Neon Chrome.

World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer,PC,Nov-8-2005,Point of View,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,BonusStage,82,The long-time problems that do and will always hold gambling videogames down still exist here mainly the fact that human emotion and reaction cannot be duplicated and gambling with fake money isn’t always satisfying when you can pull a real game together with your friends but with all elements considered there simply isn’t a better videogame simulation of the popular card game to be found.
Looney Tunes: Cartoon Conductor,DS,Jun-10-2008,Amaze Entertainment,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,GameZone,78,I wish the developers had done more with this game like include other modes or pursued the music idea further. But if you like Looney Tunes and Elite Beat Agents however this game is totally for you.

Final Fantasy,PSP,Jun-26-2007,TOSE,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GamePro,95,Gamers who are used to contemporary titles may find this one a little too simplistic and old for their tastes but if you can look beyond that youll be treated to an amazing rendition of a classic console RPG. [July 2007 p.86]
Rocket Arena,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2020,Final Strike Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,App Trigger,80,Rocket Arena is a fun game that offers a lot of features that players ask for all of the time in other games. You’ll have to ask yourself if you like this style of gameplay and the art style but the game is well designed and a blast to play. If it goes free to play eventually I think it can have sustained success.
FIFA Soccer 12,3DS,Sep-27-2011,EA Sports,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Sim,Modojo,80,One hell of a sports game with plenty of options and teams to keep you kicking for months.
My World My Way,DS,Feb-3-2009,Global A,Role-Playing | General | General,IGN,80,Despite its repetitious feel and the inevitable grind that comes with leveling up and battling your way through dozens of hours of baddies My World My Way is a unique innovative and more importantly fun game.
Spider-Man 2,PSP,Mar-23-2005,Vicarious Visions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Linear,GameZone,90,Gorgeous graphics solid gameplay and a wonderful audio track make this version of Spider-man 2 a winner.

Sky Force Anniversary,Switch,Nov-8-2018,Infinite Dreams Inc.,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,The Digital Fix,80,Sky Force Anniversary is an intense and well-designed shmup that’s a fitting addition to the Nintendo Switch. It’s great for long sessions as their are numerous medals and collectibles to grab in docked mode as well as short commute sessions in handheld mode. A few more story elements would have been ideal but the game’s addicting gameplay and upgrade system are enough to keep the player hooked. If it’s a high adrenaline bullet hell experience you’re looking to add to your Nintendo Switch collection look no further than Sky Force Anniversary.
Transference,Xbox One,Sep-18-2018,SpectreVision,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Generación Xbox,82,Singularly short but also singularly intense. Narrative of high flights with gameplay at height. It is recommended to play in one sitting.
Shining Resonance Refrain,PlayStation 4,Jul-10-2018,Sega,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GamingTrend,90,Shining Resonance Refrain is an entertaining adventure through a somewhat cliche story but it contains its own unique aspects that keep you engaged. Combat is easy to learn but theres a decent amount of depth to it. Dragonshift and B.A.N.D. sessions are wonderful combat mechanics that add more charm to the game. The relationship building and dating also adds a cute slice of life portion to the adventure.
Guns of Icarus Alliance,PlayStation 4,May-1-2018,Muse Games,Simulation | Space | Combat,GameSpace,80,The great news is that you can play across platforms with players on steam.
Urban Trial Playground,Switch,Apr-5-2018,Teyon | Tate Multimedia,Sports | Individual | Other | Biking,GameCritics,80,With a competitive Freestyle mode Urban Trial Playground would likely have earned itself a spot in the roster of local multi games I play with my roommates. I would have loved to compete with them for high scores in UTP’s impeccably designed courses. Unfortunately UTP’s multiplayer only offers the lesser of its two modes which means I’ve had all the enjoyment there is to have with it. I’ll think fondly of it but like those ’90s Capri Sun commercials its days are past.
Rad Rodgers,Xbox One,Feb-21-2018,Slipgate Studios LLC,3D | Action | Platformer | 2D,Generación Xbox,80,Rad Rodgers returns to the essence of the great platform classics of the 90s bringing its own personality. Despite its short duration Rad Rodgers is a must for lovers of the genre.

Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom,PlayStation 4,Apr-18-2017,Enigami,Role-Playing | Action RPG,RPG Fan,86,What French developer Enigami has managed to achieve with Shiness is admirable considering its humble beginnings. Its clear that a lot of blood sweat and tears went into making this adventure a reality. Its also clear that the developers fell victim to the same bogeymen that typically hinder most ambitious indie projects: time and money. Albeit flawed Shiness is an indie gem that doesnt quite live up to its potential yet still puts many big budget games to shame.
Resident Evil 7: biohazard - Banned Footage Vol. 2,PlayStation 4,Feb-14-2017,Capcom,Action Adventure | Survival,GameCritics,90,Once again the developers have demonstrated a remarkable ability to change what RE7 is and how it plays on a fundamental level. This is every bit as impressive as the rest of the game’s content but it feels completely fresh and unique just going to show what a stellar product Capcom has released. If only it was available in VR.
Super Mutant Alien Assault,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Cybernate | Chris Suffern,Action | Platformer | 2D,The Escapist,80,SMAA doesnt aim to do anything particularly novel preferring to embrace the clone nature of the game and make that aspect as good as it can be. Theres no doubt they made the right decision there as youll be hard pressed to not enjoy your time with SMAA.
Dex,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Dreadlocks Ltd | Dreadlocks,Role-Playing | Action RPG,CGMagazine,85,Even without the IP Dex manages to be the absolute best Ghost in the Shell game we’ve ever gotten.

Magical Beat,PlayStation Vita,Jun-17-2014,Arc System Works,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Destructoid,75,After everything was said and done I wanted a bit more variety -- not just in the form of more songs -- but in some new modes or even online multiplayer. The good news is the core formula is very solid so if youre looking for a new puzzle battle game this is it.
Strike Suit Zero: Director's Cut,Xbox One,Apr-8-2014,Born Ready Games,Action | Simulation | Flight | Combat,Games Master UK,83,Unfortunately a dull story stains the otherwise shiny chrome. [July 2014 p.78]
The Showdown Effect,PC,Mar-5-2013,Arrowhead Game Studios,Action | General | General,Destructoid,85,Its a game that deserves to be played however and its one thats a hilarious spectacle to watch too -- something that Arrowhead clearly realizes and is keen to exploit with its Twitch.tv integration.
Primal Carnage,PC,Oct-29-2012,Lukewarm Media,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,ZTGD,80,Lukewarm Media set out to do one simple thing with Primal Carnage: let people play as and fight dinosaurs. They hit that mark and then some. Even with no level progression I still come back to it just to eat some humans. For $15 you get the closest thing there is to a Jurassic Park multiplayer game and it also happens to be a lot of fun.
Growlanser: Wayfarer of Time,PSP,Jul-31-2012,Career Soft,Role-Playing | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | Tactics,ZTGD,87,Growlanser has flaws sure but the scope of the story and the complexity of the world beneath it really are fantastic. Dont give up on the game in the first hour or two it continues to improve and impress as you play.
The Sims Medieval: Pirates & Nobles,PC,Aug-30-2011,The Sims Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | General | Virtual | Virtual Life,GamingXP,86,An exceptional expansion pack that further adds to the base games medieval atmosphere.
Operation Flashpoint: Red River,PlayStation 3,Jun-7-2011,Codemasters,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gamers.at,83,Red River may not be as hardcore as its predecessors while still being not nearly as cool and mass market compatible as the CoDs and MoHs out there but its still is a pretty good game. Especially if you manage to grab yourself three friends for some intense Coop-Multiplayer-Action.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney,Wii,Jan-11-2010,Capcom,Adventure | First-Person | Visual Novel | Modern | Modern,Nintendo Gamer,80,Great value. [Mar 2010 p.75]
Codename Panzers: Cold War,PC,Mar-10-2009,Stormregion,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,PC Games,84,While still a pretty good RTS Cold War lacks the tactical depth of its predecessors. Just pick a few tanks and roll over whatever resistance there is. The missions are too easy and the engine although bringing really good explosions to the screen slows down gameplay to less than 20 FPS.
The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga,PlayStation 2,Oct-28-2008,Terminal Reality,Miscellaneous | Compilation,PSX Extreme,88,All in all for a mere $30 whether on your PSP or PS2 The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga is a fantastic deal for a series of fantastic games.

Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team,Game Boy Advance,Sep-18-2006,ChunSoft,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,GameShark,100,The lesson here is that just because the license is for kids the game doesnt have to be.

Dracula: The Resurrection,PC,Jun-14-2000,Canal+ Multimedia,Adventure | First-Person | Point-and-Click | Modern | Fantasy | Modern,Four Fat Chicks,100,Seriously scary and atmospheric without being horrifying more of an elegant Vincent Price scare than an 80s slasher movie. Think Goth Disney and youve got the right idea.
Mystical Ninja starring Goemon,Nintendo 64,Mar-31-1998,Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka,Action | General,TotalGames.net,85,An enjoyable fun-filled game which should keep you puzzling for a long time to come.
Elex,PC,Oct-17-2017,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Meristation,85,A giant game in all aspects that conveys the sensation of influence on the virtual world. Some failures in control are the most negative point but ELEX is a new vindication of Piranha Bytes.
Transformers: Autobots,DS,Jun-19-2007,Vicarious Visions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,82,For a licensed game I think theyve done a very good job of creating a unique game experience that stays in step with the source material while creating a new enough experience to make the game fun. Plus the Allspark Wars function is awesome!
Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star,PlayStation 4,Jan-17-2017,Marvelous Inc.,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GameGrin,95,Aside from the repetitive gameplay this is a game that Fate fans will absolutely enjoy playing and exploring in an officially released Fate game since the Stay Night visual novels don’t seem to be coming out anytime soon including the several other games that spawned from this franchise. From a gaming perspective is a flawless execution of what a Servant would do against an army but is mechanically challenging.

Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!,3DS,Nov-13-2012,WayForward,Miscellaneous | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | General | Fantasy,IGN,85,WayForward has struck gold once again as the studio continues to prove its skill at crafting superb game designs for Nintendo platforms.

Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII,PlayStation 3,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,GamesRadar+,80,We had trouble getting enough planes into the air though when we did the mode shone out as one of the better additions to this otherwise serviceable flyer.

Cleopatra: Riddle of the Tomb,PC,Mar-31-2008,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Game Chronicles,82,The bad dialogue took away for the otherwise sold Egyptian feel to the title.

Call of Cthulhu,PC,Oct-29-2018,Cyanide | Cyanide Studios,Role-Playing | General,IGN,86,Call of Cthulhu is a dark ride through a mad cosmic horror nightmare with a paranormal detective story as your vehicle. Occasionally poor level and encounter design can make the eerily atmospheric road a little bumpy but the engaging mystery and an intriguing utilization of RPG mechanics make it one of the more enjoyable Lovecraftian games in years.
MySims SkyHeroes,Wii,Sep-28-2010,Electronic Arts | Behaviour Interactive,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,Vandal,82,Despite not being an ambitious game we have liked a lot this MySims SkyHeroes. It is a direct and fun game that allows anyone to play without complications.
Nerf N-Strike Elite,Wii,Oct-26-2009,EA Salt Lake,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,IGN,75,Even with that lessened impact Nerf N-Strike Elite is a really good kid-friendly choice thats got some bang for the buck.
Fuel,PC,Jun-23-2009,Asobo Studio,Driving | Racing | General | General,Play Magazine,95,You want Bikes ATVs Muscle Cars SUVs Buggies Trucks…they’re all in here along with every conceivable type of race set across thousands of miles of populated ultra-realistic topography complete with dynamic weather.

Mahjong Cub3d,3DS,Oct-11-2011,SunSoft,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Board Games | Board / Card Game | General | General,Gaming Nexus,91,If youre a fan of Mahjong this is worth checking out.
Resident Evil Code: Veronica X HD,Xbox 360,Sep-27-2011,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,ZTGD,87,The game does still offer up some pretty good jump scares and a fantastic creepy feel.
SimCity Creator,Wii,Sep-22-2008,Electronic Arts,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Management | Breeding/Constructing | Government,Nintendo Gamer,86,A great toy to mess around with for an hour or two with enough depth to the missions and extras to keep you coming back on a regular basis for months. [Dec 2008 p.52]
Mini-Mech Mayhem,PlayStation 4,Jun-18-2019,FuturLab,Action | General,UploadVR,80,Mini-Mech Mayhem is likely destined for the same kind of obscurity as FuturLab’s Tiny Trax before it but there’s endless joy to be found from its frantic mash-up of tabletop gaming and VR. This is an untamable often hilarious bit of strategy that’s to be enjoyed just as much when you’re throwing your hands up in defeat as it is in victory. I just wish I had more people to play it with.
Pro Cycling Manager Season 2014: Le Tour de France,PC,Jun-19-2014,Cyanide,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Biking,Gaming Nexus,88,The changes and additions to Pro Cycling Manager 2014 are really quite impressive. The extreme level of detail has finally been matched with top quality graphics improved controls and a tutorial system that gets you up and going and most importantly competitive in races far more quickly.
Weedcraft Inc,PC,Apr-11-2019,Vile Monarch,Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,Digitally Downloaded,90,This isn’t a game which cracks easy jokes about weed culture; it doesn’t underestimate the finesse involved in the craft; but it also doesn’t shy away from criticising the shadier aspects of the industry either. It’s a truly fascinating look into a mythologised trade and it’ll be a test for the most seasoned of tycoon fans.
Tony Hawk's Project 8,Xbox,Nov-7-2006,Shaba Games,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Game Chronicles,88,If you must play the game on the old Xbox youll still have a good time; albeit a lonely time. Just dont play it on the 360 or you might never be satisfied with your classic system again. Tony has definitely made the jump to next-gen and you might want to do the same.
Warhammer 40000: Kill Team,Xbox 360,Jul-13-2011,THQ Warrington,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,ZTGD,87,A fantastic update to the classic twin-stick shooter formula. I would be thrilled to see either a more substantial retail release using this format or an online-enabled downloadable sequel.
Genesis Alpha One,PC,Jan-29-2019,Radiation Blue,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,GameGrin,90,Genesis Alpha One is a game that I love coming back to for both short and long bursts. It’s got an absolute ton of replayability with some really interesting designs and mechanics to boot.
Bus Simulator 18,PC,Jun-13-2018,stillalive studios,Simulation | Vehicle | Civilian,Impulsegamer,80,There’s not a lot to it but what there is can be a pleasant distraction from every day life for a while… even if it does simulate a form of every day life for some people. If you like simulation style games you will most likely find enjoyment in this one… if not then this might be worth giving a miss. For me it was another nice easy going title to add to my collection… now if you don’t mind I’m going to switch the radio to easy listening and raise the ramp and head off.
Disneyland Adventures,Xbox One,Oct-31-2017,Asobo Studio,Action Adventure | General,Windows Central,90,With a vast virtual park to explore loads of beloved characters and plenty of minigames Disneyland Adventures is one of the best Disney games out there.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - A Telltale Miniseries,PC,Apr-26-2016,Skybound LLC | Skybound Games,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Game Over Online,78,And so overall The Walking Dead: Michonne is a worthwhile game to try out.
Bust-A-Move Deluxe,PSP,Apr-4-2006,Taito Corporation,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Matching,Games Master UK,82,Sweet and simple. It might be old-fashioned but its as addictive as its ever been. [June 2006 p.70]
The X-Files: Resist or Serve,PlayStation 2,Mar-16-2004,Black Ops Entertainment,Adventure | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Computer Games Magazine,83,Truly makes gamers feel as if theyre controlling a lost episode. [July 2004 p.7]
R: Racing Evolution,Xbox,Dec-9-2003,Namco,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Official Xbox Magazine,85,Car models and framerates are superb and some of the courses look great but overally you could be forgiven for thinking youd turned on your PS2. [Jan 2004 p.60]
NBA Jam 2004,PlayStation 2,Sep-23-2003,Acclaim,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,Next Level Gaming,88,The Legends Tournament alone is reason to own NBA Jam.
Smash Cars,PlayStation 2,Aug-13-2003,Creat Studios,Driving | Car Combat,Game Chronicles,81,Smash Cars has managed to make an RC racer believer out of me. While I doubt I will be running to my hobby shop to invest in a $200 RC truck or car (one that I would probably break my first time out) I will certainly be spending countless hours driving these miniature racers in one of the best PS2 racing games I have played this year.
Tennis Masters Series 2003,Xbox,Aug-7-2003,Microids,Sports | Traditional | Tennis,XboxAddict,92,The addition of a create-a-player mode and some sort of system link or On-line capabilities would have put TMS near the top of this genre. But kudos for a solid and exciting gaming experience.
Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs,PC,May-19-2002,Blue Fang Games,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,Game Over Online,76,They filled it with a lot of nice additions but the dinosaurs are basically just really big animals and their inclusion doesn’t change by much how you play the game.
PaRappa the Rapper 2,PlayStation 2,Jan-23-2002,NanaOn-Sha,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,GamerWeb Sony,85,Sure the story is a little weird and yes the music isnt quite as good as it was in the first game but PaRappa 2 is a solid effort nonetheless.
Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon,PSP,May-15-2007,ArtePiazza,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | General | Management | Breeding/Constructing | Business / Tycoon,PSM3 Magazine UK,85,It wont convince some but the more open-minded will revel in these calm cheerful engaging fields. Gorgeous. [May 2007 p.68]
State of Emergency,Xbox,Mar-26-2003,VIS Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameZone,80,While its not an entirely brilliant game the multiplayer feature and the sharper graphics make this the essential version to own.
Joy Ride Turbo,Xbox 360,May-23-2012,BigPark,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Worth Playing,80,Is Joy Ride Turbo worth checking out? Absolutely! It doesnt reinvent the wheel and actually seems quite content to imitate the standard Mario Kart formula. However that formula is pretty well realized and even without an interesting license to back it up its a lot of fun to play with friends.
Dreamfall Chapters,PlayStation 4,May-5-2017,Red Thread Games,Fantasy | Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Cubed3,90,This particular game is a joy and has a story that has a conclusion that is worth the time and effort. It might not please all fans of its prequels due to its obscure time-hopping scenes but even they should love the final catch-all scene. It is an excellent entry to the universe and a fantastic addition to the PS4 catalogue and will leave most hoping for another game in the future.
Spaceball: Revolution,Wii,Sep-14-2009,Virtual Toys,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,N-Europe,80,Precise controls and a simple yet solid game concept make for an addictive gameplay experience that is well worth the Points!
Shenmue III,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2019,Ys Net,Action Adventure | Open-World,Digitally Downloaded,100,Shenmue 3 wont disappoint fans of the first two. But thats almost secondary to the real story here. Shenmue 3s real strength is in the way that it suggests a different way of looking at the very storytelling of videogames. It challenges the idea that a games value is in it aspiring to be cinema and it provides a pretty compelling argument for the alternative too. On a personal note as a fan of both theatre and Shenmue this game is effortlessly my pick of what has been a very good 2019 for the creative side of videogames.
RAGE 2,PlayStation 4,May-14-2019,id Software | Avalanche Studios,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Jeuxvideo.com,85,Rage 2 shines in its gunfights driving sequences and from the fun perks and upgrades that you can use. The open world is an invitation to exploration but still sometimes feels a bit empty.
Harvest Moon DS,DS,Sep-12-2006,TOSE,Strategy | Breeding/Constructing | Management | Breeding/Constructing | Business / Tycoon,GameZone,92,Being able to save anywhere makes it the perfect portable game and since theres virtually no learning curve you can pick it up and play at any time at all.
Outlaw Tennis,PlayStation 2,Jul-26-2005,Hypnotix,Sports | Traditional | Tennis,Next Level Gaming,85,Despite Outlaw series games not being exactly the model of authenticity when it comes to sports games they know how to make a fun game. Tennis is no exception. The issues I take with the repetitive animations sound and the ball physics are really minor when it comes to these games.
Worms Forts: Under Siege,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Team17,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy,TotalGames.net,82,Playing Worms Forts is not entirely unlike finding that you have just been poured the worm out of the bottom of a tequila bottle. Youre not entirely sure about whether its a good thing or not; but swig back this odd looking creature and an hour later good times follow.
The Almost Gone,PC,Jun-25-2020,Happy Volcano,Adventure | General,The Digital Fix,80,Beautiful in its simplicity The Almost Gone is definitely a game that won’t appeal to everyone but for this reviewer it was a worthwhile experience. Some frustratingly obtuse puzzle solutions aside the 3D point and click gaming is well-designed and the minimalist art style fits perfectly. It also packs an emotional punch for anyone familiar with the tragic issues portrayed which it deals with sensitively and powerfully.
Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom,Xbox One,Apr-18-2017,Enigami,Role-Playing | Action RPG,TheXboxHub,90,All in all Shiness: The Lightning Kingdom is a phenomenal game that deserves to be played and enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of RPG action games.
Ride 2,PC,Oct-7-2016,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Simulation | Automobile,Game Debate,85,A new climate and a lick of paint have made another game in practically the precise mould of the brilliant Sniper Elite III so I cant really complain. Its like going back to your favourite restaurant and ordering what you always order. Sure its a bloody delight and theres not much bad to say about it but perhaps something slightly different (aware as I am that this is vague and ill-defined) might have been nice?
Battle Fantasia,PlayStation 3,Dec-22-2009,Arc System Works,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,Playstation Official Magazine UK,70,Theres a decent fighting system underneath all the pencil-sketches and pixie dust. [Mar 2009 p.102]
Mafia III,Xbox One,Oct-7-2016,Hangar 13,Action Adventure | Open-World,Forbes,81,If you approach Mafia III as an interactive journey then you probably won’t have any issue with it overall. If you’re looking for a fully fleshed out title akin to GTA then Mafia III could come off as a shallow release...I’m somewhere in the middle but leaning more toward the former. The story and visuals are easily the strength of the game and the gameplay isn’t flawed or repetitive enough to kill the vibe.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations,Wii,May-10-2010,Capcom,Adventure | First-Person | Visual Novel | Modern | Modern,NintendoWorldReport,85,A great game and the best entry in the franchise. The storyline never fails to impress: it dives very deep into the darkest pits of the human mind while still having a sense of humor about it.
Need for Speed Carbon,Wii,Nov-19-2006,EA Canada,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,NintendoWorldReport,85,Instead of porting it over without much thought they took the time to get something working that took advantage of the Wiis strengths.
Thief,PlayStation 4,Feb-25-2014,Eidos Montreal,Fantasy | Action Adventure | General | Fantasy,Eurogamer Italy,90,One of the best action-stealth titles in years and the first serious contender for the 2014 Game of the Year contest.
Giraffe and Annika,PC,Feb-17-2020,Atelier Mimina,Adventure | 3D | Third-Person,Digital Chumps,85,This game’s animation is a beautiful combination of 3D and comic book-like graphics. It is a refreshing take on an adventure and rhythm game and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. This is definitely a game to add to your Steam Wishlist.
Red Johnson's Chronicles,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Lexis Numerique,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Action,Gameblog.fr,80,Red Johnsons Chronicles is a nice and fresh adventure game. Its gameplays varied its story OK and its universe is worth a shot. The only downfalls of Lexis Numériques Game are to be a little too easy and some tiny shortcomings to get rid of for the sequel.
Haunting Ground,PlayStation 2,May-10-2005,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,Pelit (Finland),89,A good-looking puzzle-oriented horror game. It has an innovative panic system and a dramatic storyline. The adventure and the puzzles are well balanced which makes Haunting Ground a very enjoyable experience. [May 05]
CivCity: Rome,PC,Jul-24-2006,Firaxis Games | FireFly Studios,Strategy | City Building | Management | Historic | Historic | Government,IGN,82,The interaction between the buildings could definitely be a little more complicated but the challenges of fitting everything together is more than sufficient to keep you coming back for more.
Kane & Lynch: Dead Men,PC,Nov-20-2007,Io Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,GameTrailers,80,The right combination of gameplay elements and design decisions make Kane and Lynch easy to recommend to crime junkies and anyone who enjoys a little therapeutic videogame violence. A well-executed plot really makes the game while the multiplayer additions add replay value and variety.
Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes,Switch,Jan-18-2019,Grasshopper Manufacture,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GamingTrend,90,Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes is outrageous. The game is uncompromisingly zany: full of smart design fluid combat and laugh out loud personality front to back. While some may be turned off by its low budget feel and disjointed design those who can look past these rough edges will find a hack-and-slash so quirky that it’ll be tough not to fall in love. This title stands as a shining beacon of bold creativity and anyone who values risk-taking in games owes it to themself to give Travis Strikes Again a shot.
Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation,PlayStation Vita,Jan-27-2015,Felistella,Role-Playing | General | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,90,It pushes more boundaries and is a sharper satire than the other games in the series as fine as they are and that marks this one out as something special indeed.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Xbox,Jun-2-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Games Radar,80,A genuinely good third-year romp for Harry. Accomplished and absorbing its not quite magical but its certainly no muggle either. [GamesMaster]
Champions of Anteria,PC,Aug-30-2016,Blue Byte,Strategy | Real-Time | General,Areajugones,80,This game perfectly mixes strategy with role playing. Its progression system is very complete and the story that it features is funny and interesting.
Castlevania: Harmony of Despair,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2010,Konami,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,100,A fascinating multiplayer experiment but also a really solid streamlined single player vania. [Nov 2010 p.120]
Dynasty Warriors Next,PlayStation Vita,Feb-21-2012,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,PlayStation Universe,85,A great rendition of an old IP by using the functionality of the PS Vita in the best ways.
Blair Witch,Xbox One,Aug-30-2019,Bloober Team,Action Adventure | Survival,SomosXbox,85,Blair Witch is a great horror experience. Its frightening and agonizing. It takes us back to our deeper fears. Despite not being technically impressing gameplay and story manage to shine. Bloober Team shows us once more why is one of the best horror studios in the whole videogame industry.
Dissidia: Final Fantasy NT,PlayStation 4,Jan-30-2018,Team Ninja,Action | Fighting | 3D,Digitally Downloaded,90,This is genuinely the first time I’ve ever been hooked on an online-orientated competitive game.
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,PlayStation 3,Jun-30-2009,Activision,Action | General | General,PGNx Media,80,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is very sharp lighthearted and fun game that will please younger fans of the movie with its varied gameplay good looks and clever writing. A recommended purchase for fans of the movie.
Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Protoman,Game Boy Advance,Jun-21-2005,Capcom,Role-Playing | Action RPG,eToychest,83,If you can stomach or even master the unforgiving battle conditions its a good game with an okay story and good combat.
World Championship Poker: Deluxe Series,DS,Apr-17-2005,Sensory Sweep,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,RewiredMind,80,Poker fans will lap this up and a few non-poker fans like myself will become converts simply due to the fact that the game explains things so clearly. As much as the laws of logic say that I shouldnt be saying this World Championship Poker is a highly addictive game.
Yo-kai Watch Blasters: White Dog Squad,3DS,Sep-7-2018,Level 5,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,90,Overall the game is fantastic. It’s fun for solo play and is even better when working in co-op. I’ve poured hours into the game and have still not completed every possible task available. There’s so much replayability and it’ll have you craving for more Yo-kai madness… or maybe a Yo-kai is making you think that. Regardless the game is definitely fantastic and I’d highly recommend adding it to your 3DS’s library.
State of Mind,PlayStation 4,Aug-15-2018,Daedalic Entertainment,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | 3D | Third-Person,Worth Playing,85,Utilizing thought-provoking puzzles and intuitive gameplay makes State of Mind a fun experience that keeps us hooked until the very end. With so much to look at and explore the title does an excellent job of world-building and creating a fully realized society. Its a deep game with much lore that adds to the genre. Where State of Mind excels in providing excellent gameplay visuals and plot hooks it falters in being able to answer many of the questions that it poses. Depending on which ending players arrive at you could be left asking Is that it? Despite its flaws however State of Mind kept us hooked until the very end. If one can overlook the plot inconsistencies State of Mind is a deep story about the what-ifs of humanitys future.
All Zombies Must Die!,PlayStation 3,Dec-27-2011,Doublesix,Action | General | General | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Games Master UK,90,Theres also a fantastic variety to the undead. [Apr 2012 p.87]
Double Cross,Switch,Jan-10-2019,13AM Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpace,90,A great meshing of different types of gameplay styles that I love.
Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered,PC,Jul-3-2018,Volition Inc.,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,GameSpace,85,While Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered doesnt bring any new content to the ten year old game the graphics upgrade is well worth checking out as it brings it up to par with all but the top-tier AAA titles of recent times.
Corpse Party: Book of Shadows,PSP,Jan-15-2013,5pb,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Horror | Horror | Survival,PlayStation Universe,90,A literary masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of video games being legitimate art with its suspenseful thrilling and unique narrative that takes the horror genre to a new level. It is a classic for those Halloween fright nights but just make sure to double check the doors are locked when you turn the lights out.
Code of Princess,3DS,Oct-9-2012,Studio Saizensen,Role-Playing | Action RPG | General | Action RPG,ZTGD,93,The gurus at Atlas have once again graced us with a fantastic piece of gaming art. If you own a 3DS then you owe it to yourself to try this great game.
BloodRayne 2,PC,Aug-2-2005,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,BonusStage,83,Whether she’s harpoon-tossing enemies into a crusher on a garbage truck or a downed helicopter’s whirring blades or rail sliding 40 feet and slicing through a bunch of enemies taking shots at her Rayne has the gaming world by the throat.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,PC,May-25-2004,KnowWonder,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamer's Hell,85,It is easy enough for a kid to master and offers enough depth for adults to enjoy.
Dead to Rights,PC,Nov-10-2003,Namco,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameZone,79,Fairly solid gameplay experience but it really does feel like it was made for a console.
Blackthorne,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2003,Mass Media,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,Game Informer,80,There arent many thinking-mans action games like this on the GBA. [Dec 2003 p.187]
Legaia 2: Duel Saga,PlayStation 2,Oct-1-2002,Prokion,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,GamerWeb Sony,90,Incorporates a moving story with surprisingly addictive gameplay while adding a dash of comedy to spruce up an otherwise sinister plot. The environments are beautiful and highly detailed.

Tsugunai: Atonement,PlayStation 2,Nov-29-2001,Cattle Call,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,IGN,84,Finally PS2 has a decent RPG. Granted you have to get past the graphics but that battle engine just had me wanting to play more and more.
NFL Quarterback Club 2002,PlayStation 2,Sep-5-2001,Acclaim,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GameZone,90,Not exactly a brain buster this game is good for hanging out with friends eating drinking and yelling at the screen...just like a real game.
Star Wars: Demolition,Dreamcast,Nov-19-2000,Luxoflux | Inc.,Driving | Car Combat,Sega X,90,The thing with Star Wars Demolition is that you have to be patient. Even Master Yoda would advise patience in this instance.
Uncharted: Fight for Fortune,PlayStation Vita,Dec-4-2012,Sony Bend,Strategy | Action Adventure | Turn-Based | Modern | Modern | Card Battle,GameCritics,80,Although the core Uncharted titles might not do much for me Fight for Fortune is a respectably entertaining title for players who enjoy the CCG genre. It might not have the same run-and-gun Nathan Drake is usually known for but Ill take card combos and strategy over killing a thousand generic thugs and auto-climbing ledges any day.
DC Universe Online,PlayStation 3,Jan-11-2011,WBIE,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,TheSixthAxis,90,DC Universe Online is ground-breaking; its innovative and downright addictive.

Ministry of Broadcast,PC,Jan-30-2020,Homeless Unicorn | Ministry of Broadcast Studios,Adventure | General,3DJuegos,80,Its hard for Ministry of Broadcast to left anyone indifferent. Its simply made with a craft that I missed. Its puzzles and platforms always invite you to continue never overwhelming or demoralizing. Like the reality shows its inspired by its morbid chaotic and you never know whats going to happen next.

Urban Trial Freestyle 2,3DS,Mar-30-2017,Teyon | Tate Multimedia,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Nintendo Enthusiast,85,The first Urban Trial Freestyle was already a pretty fun game so this sequel simply took a solid foundation and built upon it. With the hefty amount of courses a track builder online leaderboards great visuals and engaging gameplay I can definitely say that this game is worth picking up if you’re into racers and/or physics-based titles. Seeing that it only costs $7 you really don’t have much to lose. While there is a bit of a learning curve once you get the hang of it the experience is pretty fun.
Uncanny Valley,PC,Apr-23-2015,Cowardly Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,Twinfinite,100,The game creates a compelling sense of dread and packs just enough into a relatively small package that multiple plays are essentially required just to find everything that it has to offer. For anyone that’s a fan of a less action-oriented style of horror the seething mysteries of Uncanny Valley are definitely worth looking into.
LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Traveller's Tales,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Nintendo Power,85,The action looks fantastic on the Nintendo 3DS handheld and the systems 3D effect gives each colorful setting a real feeling of depth. [Apr 2011 p.81]
Mega Man X: Command Mission,GameCube,Sep-21-2004,Capcom,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Kombo,85,The game seems unpleasantly short however  in less than sixteen hours of play I had cleared six of the games ten story chapters.
Miitopia,3DS,Jul-28-2017,Nintendo,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,90,The narrative is on the light-side but that makes it perfect for short bursts at a time. By the time I came to the end of Miitopia I found it slightly emotional to say goodbye to my companions of more than a decade but it was truly worth the ride.
Cel Damage,GameCube,Jan-7-2002,Pseudo Interactive,Driving | Racing | Kart,Hot Games,80,It belongs on the Game Cube -- the fast-paced action silly game play and innovative graphics will find a more appreciative audience here.

Secret Files 3,PC,Sep-13-2012,Animation Arts,Adventure | General | General,PC Games,85,Animation Arts has again created a felicitous adventure in its well known adventure series Secret Files. Secret Files 3 (Geheimakte 3) brings great and diversified puzzles (for experts maybe to easy sometimes) and again mixes a fictitious story with real historical events. Even the mini games are fitting in and leave you the choice of two levels of difficulty. Orchestration dramatic and cinematic presentation in Secret Files 3 are great and the game even provides several playable characters also as endings - depending on the decisions you make. Although the game lacks optimization of animations and the graphic presentation is getting kind of outdated due to the age of the engine the game still looks pretty good. Overall its quite a recommendation for all adventure gamers.
MySims Racing,DS,Jun-12-2009,EA Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart | Automobile,NintendoWorldReport,80,My Sims Racing is a surprisingly tight game with great production values and a lot of heart and it can’t be recommended highly enough for the younger gamers among us. There may not be enough content to fulfill older gamers but it’s certainly a fun multiplayer game.

Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu,Xbox,Oct-16-2003,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameShark,82,A nice beat em up that is pleasant to look at offers a wide variety of different moves and chracters and a nice two-player co-op mode that makes the game a lot more valuable to adults and kids that want to pal around Gotham as their favorite super hero.
The Godfather II,PlayStation 3,Apr-7-2009,EA Redwood Shores,Action Adventure | Adventure | Third-Person | Historic | Linear | Open-World | Modern,GamePro,100,It isnt the best open-world game out there but it does a sublime job of capturing what it feels like to be the head of a virtual crime family. [Apr 2009 p.81]
Shank,PC,Oct-25-2010,Klei Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,ZTGD,89,I really enjoyed Shank. It was a somewhat short experience of around four hours but the entire time I was having fun. The combat and the platforming all flow so smoothly throughout the game.
NFL Head Coach 09,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Management | Management | Sim,GameShark,83,Even with its quirks and bugs NFL Head Coach 09 is the type of game that will silently siphon away hours of your free time. Sitting down at night after the family has gone to bed to get in an hour or so of game time only to discover that all of a sudden it’s the middle of the night and your eyes are straining.

Of course since this is only the second entry in a five-part series players can expect it to end at a point designed to leave them desperate for more and it does. The third installment can’t get here fast enough!
Outcast: Second Contact,Xbox One,Nov-7-2017,Appeal | Bigben Games,Action Adventure | Adventure | General | Open-World,AusGamers,80,Outside of the story exploration and puzzles combat can play an equally big part in the overall story. But underneath the shiny new visuals Outcast remains pretty much the same. Which means controls and combat that was fine if a little clumsy in 1999 is even more so today. But just like then it’s quickly overlooked for what is an adventure quite unlike any other. An impressively realised world filled with character moments of sheer triumph and charm. Outcast: Second Contact is well worth a look for both fans and newcomers alike.
Claire: Extended Cut,Xbox One,Sep-6-2016,Hailstorm Games Inc,Adventure | General,ICXM,80,It tells a complex but intelligent story. It utilizes art design to enhance the gameplay. It uses sound design to terrify the player. And it delivers it all in an easily digestible package with replay value. I would consider Claire an excellent entry into the horror game genre.
Redeemer: Enhanced Edition,PlayStation 4,Jul-19-2019,Sobaka,Action Adventure | Linear,IGN Spain,85,An heir to the ultraviolence of Hotline Miami really deep funny and replayable.

R: Racing Evolution,GameCube,Dec-9-2003,Namco,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,TotalGames.net,84,Every member of the CUBE team was looking forward to this and they all left the first session grumbling words like disaster bollocks ad dont give up the day job Namco. Its slow dull and tedious. Dont get too depressed though because there is a light at the end of this tunnel.
Pirate Hunter,PC,Oct-17-2003,Ascaron Entertainment GmbH | Ascaron Entertainment,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GameZone,83,If you enjoy action games with a dash of strategy that are open ended have a good amount of replay value and offer you the chance to play as you wish then you should definitely check it out.

Extermination,PlayStation 2,Jul-23-2001,Deep Space,Action Adventure | Horror,Hot Games,90,Although not terrible complicated or intricate it’s still a great game with a good interface and lots of scary stuff.
World War Z,PlayStation 4,Apr-16-2019,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,Gaming Age,91,I’d absolutely suggest giving World War Z a shot even more so if you were a fan of Left 4 Dead. It really scratches that itch namely a fun zombie focused co-op shooter with a solid progression system that’ll keep you hooked for a while. So despite its association with a so-so horror film World War Z manages to rise above its source material into something that I found to be a lot of fun.
Spintires: Mudrunner,PlayStation 4,Oct-31-2017,Koch Media,Simulation | Vehicle | Civilian,Everyeye.it,76,Mud Runner ultimately is an outstanding title ... in the narrowest sense of the term.
The Sims 3: Showtime,PC,Mar-6-2012,The Sims Studio,Simulation | Miscellaneous | Virtual Life | Virtual | Virtual Life,GamingXP,87,If you own The Sims 3 and want to have even more fun you absolutely should get the Showtime expansion.
Dungeonland,PC,Jan-29-2013,Critical Studio,Action | General | General,Hooked Gamers,85,Despite these minor criticisms the game is brilliant. Having played it both with friends and alone it is obvious that this game is -supposed- to be played with friends. When playing alone it feels a bit repetitive but when you add two friends screaming commands in your ear and a third one laughing manically as he plots your demise this game is pure candy. If you enjoy playing this kind of game with friends you will love Dungeonland. If you are a friendless loner however you might want to give it a miss.
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,GameCube,Oct-10-2006,Krome Studios,Action | Platformer | 3D,Play Magazine,85,With any luck Kromes overhaul will prove lucrative enough to warrant them continuing the brand flying Spyro into next-gen skies and who knows perhaps a veritable rebirth.

Felix the Reaper,Switch,Oct-17-2019,Kong Orange,Adventure | General,Pure Nintendo,85,Even if puzzle games aren’t really your thing the standard of writing and quality of Felix’s dancing are too good to pass up. If puzzle games are for you then look no further than Felix the Reaper.
Infernium,Switch,Apr-5-2018,Carlos Coronado,Action Adventure | General,NintendoWorldReport,85,Overall this game left me in shambles as I would feel a sense of extreme dread as I made progress throughout each world as I never fully knew what reaction any of my decisions could cause. However it gave me a sense of relief and wonder when I would solve the puzzle given to me and continue forward to see what challenges awaited me next.
Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame,PlayStation 4,Feb-13-2018,Milestone S.r.l,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,COGconnected,80,Another cool feature is the track surface. It is fully deformable meaning that the dirt surface changes consistency when it gets wet. The physics dynamics of driving on a dry surface versus blasting and sliding through mud changes your approach to racing on a track.
Dead Island: Definitive Collection,Xbox One,May-31-2016,Techland,Miscellaneous | Compilation,ICXM,75,I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to newcomers but not so much to returning players. It’s a lot of fun no matter what but Dead Island is much more enjoyable the first time around. Just take that into account when making a purchasing decision.
Trivial Pursuit,Wii,Mar-10-2009,EA Bright Light,Miscellaneous | Board Games | Board Games | Board / Card Game,GameDaily,80,With thousands of questions across six categories and the option to purchase downloadable packs on the cheap this version of Trivial Pursuit wont get old anytime soon.

WALL-E,PlayStation 2,Jun-24-2008,Asobo Studio,Action | Platformer | 3D,VideoGamer,80,WALL.E on the PS2 is definitely the most accomplished version available. The emphasis on platforming and puzzles suits the character and makes for a more thoughtful game.

Full Auto 2: Battlelines,PlayStation 3,Dec-7-2006,Pseudo Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Gamer's Hell,81,A commendable improvement to last years release.

Hard Reset Redux,Xbox One,Jun-3-2016,Flying Wild Hog,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,MondoXbox,75,A real old school shooter true to the genres roots and packed full of action; its main flaw is the uninspired design but every 90s shooter lover should give it a chance.
The Way,PC,May-19-2016,Puzzling Dream,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN Italia,88,If you feel nostalgia for classic arcade adventure games from the Nineties like Flashback and Another World you should not miss this one. But be aware of it’s unforgiving level design.

Fuel,PlayStation 3,Jun-2-2009,Asobo Studio,Driving | Racing | General | General,Play Magazine,95,You want Bikes ATVs Muscle Cars SUVs Buggies Trucks…they’re all in here along with every conceivable type of race set across thousands of miles of populated ultra-realistic topography complete with dynamic weather. And it all looks and plays spectacularly. Unless you’re looking for an authentic hard core sim there’s no reason you shouldn’t leave right now and even if you are a little FUEL might just change your mind.
Namco Museum DS,DS,Sep-18-2007,M2,Miscellaneous | Compilation | Compilation,Game Chronicles,84,Younger kids will likely be turned off by the simplistic game designs and even simpler graphics and sound then again there is nothing like a good father-son rivalry and dad might just have a chance with one of the eight games waiting inside this classic collection.
Warhammer 40000: Squad Command,PSP,Nov-12-2007,RedLynx,Strategy | Turn-Based | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Tactics,AtomicGamer,85,Overall Squad Command is an excellent pickup for a strategy fan. You get a nice and difficult campaign to play through with a wide variety of weapons to rain destruction upon your enemies.
Blood Will Tell,PlayStation 2,Sep-21-2004,Paon Corporation,Action Adventure | Fantasy,AceGamez,90,Offers a wonderfully enjoyable narrative with slick controls and an absence of any significant problems. Where it falls down is its particularly ordinary presentation which given the stylish nature of many titles in the genre wont do it any favours.
Super Daryl Deluxe,PlayStation 4,Apr-10-2018,Dan & Gary Games,Role-Playing | Action RPG,PlayStation Universe,90,I cannot overstate the hilarity in this game. The combat is fun if a bit tedious at times but it never drops the ball on consistently delivering humor in oddball situations built around a cast of lovable characters. With a little luck you just might learn something you were never taught in highscool.
Disney's Meet the Robinsons,PlayStation 2,Mar-27-2007,Avalanche Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,AceGamez,90,The game is a lot of fun makes great use of the license will definitely appeals to the children.
Small Radios Big Televisions,PC,Nov-8-2016,Owen Deery | Fire Face,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Destructoid,85,Despite its brisk pace and sparse storytelling Small Radios Big Televisions manages to feel like a complete handcrafted package.

Rogue Wizards,PC,Sep-27-2016,Spellbind Studios,Role-Playing | Roguelike | Western-Style,Twinfinite,80,While its story and approach play it safe the smooth gameplay and optional perma-death Hard Mode still bring plenty to enjoy.

Tecmo Bowl Throwback,Xbox 360,Apr-28-2010,Southend Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Team | Football | Arcade | Arcade,1UP,91,Tecmo Bowl Throwback is exactly what it claims to be and it freshens up the classic version of the game without completely changing it (read: ruining it).

City of Brass,Xbox One,May-5-2018,Uppercut Games Pty Ltd,Action Adventure | General,XboxAddict,85,City of Brass is a perfect platform for gamers that enjoy speed running and adrenaline chasing but it is also a great experience for the less dedicated that just want to run around and eventually say they overcame something momentous.

Dark Summit,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2001,Radical Entertainment,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,TotalGames.net,80,The reasonably slick framerate is compromised somewhat in the slightly lacklustre two-player sections.

The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics,PC,Feb-4-2020,BonusXP,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,PC Gamer,75,It’s not going to rock anyone’s world but for a cheap TV tie-in it’s a lot more engaging than it has any right to be serving as a pleasant opportunity for any series fan to spend a few more hours in Gelfling company.
Scanner Sombre,PC,Apr-26-2017,Introversion Software,Action Adventure | Linear,Game Informer,80,Perhaps what’s most impressive to me is how effectively lean Scanner Sombre is. The entire game is only three hours. Mechanically speaking there isn’t much you do outside of using the scanner to solve puzzles find your way and outwit foes. However the foreboding atmosphere and where its plot ultimately leads is satisfying enough that its gameplay and storytelling are compelling. Whether you’re coming across a new upgrade for your LIDAR or slowly mapping out a spooky tunnel and inching toward danger Scanner Sombre is a consistently spooky and somber game that’s worthwhile for those who want to scratch that horror-adventure itch.
Pacific Storm,PC,Oct-2-2006,Lesta Studio,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Worth Playing,85,Pacific Storm is a remarkable offering for armchair commanders who enjoy micromanaging all aspects of war. The only real disappointment I had with the game was the mismatched background music.
Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars,PlayStation 3,Oct-9-2008,Psyonix,Action | General | General,GameFocus,84,If you have friends who own this game then run out and buy it as honestly there really is no more enjoyable multiplayer experience on the PSN at this. The single player side of things is fun but it only has so much enjoyment as the game was obviously built to be a multiplayer fun fest of rocket powered proportions.
Touch Detective 2 1/2,DS,Oct-9-2007,BeeWorks,Adventure | General | General,RPG Fan,84,Therefore the bottom line is that if you could not get into the original Touch Detective 2 1/2 will not change your mind. However if you enjoyed the first game youll definitely want to pick this one up.

V-Rally 4,Xbox One,Sep-11-2018,Kylotonn,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Xbox Tavern,83,V-Rally 4 is a deep and challenging experience. There’s an undeniable issue with the game’s somewhat overly loose controls but with that to the side this is every bit as engaging as V-Rally has always been.

Crossing Souls,Switch,Jul-26-2018,Fourattic,Action Adventure | General,God is a Geek,75,It’s the same game as it was back then. Playing on the Switch allows you to play with it anywhere especially if you’re midway through one of the frustrating boss fights. It doesn’t quite look as good as when it’s docked but the game is still vibrant and lovely to look at. If you want something that reminds you what the 80s were like and fancy a game that fully embraces the notion of retro Crossing Souls is the embodiment of it.
Tyranny: Bastard's Wound,PC,Sep-7-2017,Obsidian Entertainment,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Ragequit.gr,80,Players who appreciated what Tyranny has to offer will definitely enjoy Bastards Wound as the side content it introduces is of the highest quality and true to the standards set by its developers.

Fisherman's Challenge,PlayStation 2,Jan-19-2003,Konami,Sports | Nature | Fishing,Absolute Playstation,84,This game is tougher than you would think. It’s not a mindless game of casting and bringing in fish after fish. You need to carefully plan a course of attack.

Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Interplay,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Gamezilla!,88,Its exactly what I find fun in games and the fact its a Fallout title automatically makes it a winner in my book.

Outlaw Tennis,Xbox,Jul-26-2005,Hypnotix,Sports | Traditional | Tennis,Game Chronicles,92,The best news is that Outlaw Tennis is at its core a fantastic tennis game so when you eventually turn off all the outlaw flavor you still have a remarkably fun challenging and somewhat realistic tennis game to occupy countless gaming hours both solo and online.
Double Dragon: Neon,Xbox 360,Sep-12-2012,WayForward,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameWatcher,90,Double Dragon Neon is evidence.

WWE 2K18,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2017,Yuke's,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,Hobby Consolas,85,2K Games and Yukes have heard the critics and learned from them.

Age of Mythology: Extended Edition,PC,May-8-2014,Ensemble Studios,Strategy | Real-Time | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer,77,Age of Mythology still has a lot of value beyond nostalgia then but I’d wait for a discount before committing your cash especially if you already bought it a decade ago. This isn’t a total remake so don’t go in expecting one. The Extended Edition is still a really well-paced and entertaining RTS one that revels in over-the-top imagery and remains a one-off in subject matter within the oeuvre of the sadly departed Ensemble.
Terminator 3: The Redemption,Xbox,Sep-2-2004,Paradigm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,AceGamez,90,With a fast and frantic single player with all the trimmings plus the voice and image of Arnie I cant complain one bit.

Transformers: Decepticons,DS,Jun-19-2007,Vicarious Visions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Cheat Code Central,82,For a licensed game I think the developers have done a very good job of creating a unique game experience that lets you experience the source material in two completely different ways.

The Sims 4,Xbox One,Nov-17-2017,Maxis,Simulation | Virtual | Virtual Life,Xbox Tavern,84,The Sims 4 once again proves that a good PC game that’s primarily designed for keyboard and mouse simply doesn’t suit the controller. It’s but one of the many reasons that Microsoft needs to pull their fingers out and enable keyboard and mouse support for the Xbox One not only will it help the transition of games like this and Divinity Original Sin but it will add more appeal too.
Rubik's World,DS,Oct-28-2008,Two Tribes,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,Game Informer,80,There’s plenty here to twist and turn your brain.

Nights of Azure 2: Bride of the New Moon,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Gust,Action | General | Role-Playing | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,90,Nights of Azure 2 is a really lovely game and I don’t really play it for the combat anyway. Rooted in various theatrical styles that give it an aesthetic and tone that I find so appealing it’s not the kind of game that could ever hope to find mainstream acceptance but that’s not unusual for Gust JRPGs. The things that it does well: the characterisation the melodramatic - but not in a pejorative sense - storytelling and the general artfulness of it all are the reasons I played the last one and this new one doesnt disappoint with any of that.

Nine Parchments,Switch,Dec-5-2017,Frozenbyte | Inc.,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameSpace,85,Nine Parchments is a solid twin-stick isometric Action RPG with some great multiplayer fun.

Pitfall: The Lost Expedition,PC,Oct-15-2004,Beenox,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,GameZone,80,I thought the humor alone was worth the price of admission. Every thing that Harry does or says is over-exaggerated to the point of absurd silliness.

Black The Fall,PlayStation 4,Jul-11-2017,Sand Sailor Studio,Action | General,Push Square,90,Black The Fall is a special game. The prodigious range of puzzles and platforming mechanics present rival that of a game ten times longer than it and the visual and auditory treat on offer elevates that gameplay to an incredibly high standard. You’ll witness the human race at its very worst through some horrifying imagery but this presents itself as more of a gas to fuel a revolution. Black The Fall is a remarkable experience that will stay with us for a long time and its one that you must not miss out on.
Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell,PC,Jan-20-2015,Volition Inc.,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Open-World,GameOver.gr,80,Its quite short but the over the top action and humour of the franchise will surely pay out.
Nibiru: Age of Secrets,PC,Aug-31-2005,Future Games,Adventure | General | General,Just Adventure,91,I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery the puzzles and the graphics and felt right at home with much of it.

The Sinking City,Xbox One,Jun-25-2019,Frogwares,Action Adventure | Survival,Generación Xbox,85,The ambitious fascinating yet flawed The Sinking City establishes itself as the new Lovecraftian title to look at.

This is the Police 2,PC,Jul-31-2018,Weappy Studio,Simulation | Virtual | Career,GameSpace,95,Few stories in games can successfully make me hate the protagonist and at the same time draw me compulsively further into the events and plot twists.

Tannenberg,PlayStation 4,Jul-24-2020,M2H,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,PlayStation Universe,80,The modest production values combined with a lack of over-the-top Hollywood bombast will likely ensure that like Verdun before it not everyone will enjoy Tannenberg. For those who can look beyond such flaws however Tannenberg cements itself as a gloriously satisfying strategic shooter that invites players to pit their tactical minds and reflexes in one of the most overlooked theaters of war in a way that no other FPS manages to achieve.

WRC: FIA World Rally Championship,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Gamestyle,80,WRC: World Rally Championship 2 does a bit more to become accessible to new and casual players but in truth it is a game for real fans of the sport those who really want a full on challenge.

Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge,PC,May-5-2006,Spellbound,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,Pelit (Finland),89,Desperados 2: Cooper’s Revenge continues on its predecessor’s path. The gameplay graphics and characters are great. Add to that the Morricone-like music and you have a Wild West addict’s dream. Still the game falls short of masterpiece status because of too much frustrating sneaking some graphics bugs and the occasionally stupid AI. [June 2006]

Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3,PlayStation 3,Jun-5-2008,Backbone Emeryville,Action | General | General,1UP,83,Despite the minor flaws I loved most every minute of Wolf of the Battlefield.

Unsolved Crimes,DS,Sep-30-2008,Now Production,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,GamingXP,83,Unsolved Crimes strikes me as being a really good game because of its consistent story thrilling cut scenes and interesting cases! My own power of deduction intuition and perception are trained. One has the feeling of solving the case on his or her own. A good mixture of being obvious and suspense!
One Piece: Burning Blood,PlayStation 4,May-31-2016,Spike Chunsoft,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameGrin,80,A fun game for the fans who want to relive one of the most exciting arcs of the One Piece franchise.

Darius Cozmic Collection: Console,Switch,Jun-16-2020,ININ Games,Miscellaneous | Compilation,Gaming Age,100,The only small issue is that small screen size can be a factor in handheld mode when playing on the triple and dual-screen arcade releases in pixel-perfect mode. Outside of that this is an absolutely amazing collection of classic shoot ‘em ups that I feel is ultimately worth the higher price tag. I think you’ll agree that the overall quality of this collection is worth it.

Frogger Helmet Chaos,PSP,Sep-29-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,AceGamez,90,Although not all of the DSs features are utilised (mainly the touch screen) the challenging gameplay and DS download function more than make up for this.

Super Trucks Racing,PlayStation 2,Oct-29-2003,Jester Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Yahoo!,80,A refreshing breeze of fresh oily air in a stale market full of near identical racing games and if you give it a try it’s likely you’ll be very pleasantly surprised.
Freaky Flyers,PlayStation 2,Aug-5-2003,Midway Studios - San Diego,Driving | Racing | Kart,GamePro,80,The two-player mode isn’t all bad but for such a solid game it’s a flaw that’s keeping this otherwise plenary racing game below the ranks of Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing.
Auto Modellista,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2003,Capcom,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,Gamezilla!,92,This game has great controls but they’re touchy.
UFC: Tapout 2,Xbox,Mar-20-2003,DreamFactory,Action | Fighting | 3D,GamePro,80,The most impressive feature in Tapout 2 is the redesigned visuals. Dream Factory chose to completely redo the graphics to make them look more life-like and as authentic as the real deal.
Disaster Report,PlayStation 2,Feb-15-2003,Irem,Action Adventure | Modern,GameCritics,90,Add to that some late-game plot twists several path-altering choices a wide variety of obstacles to overcome multiple endings to discover and a wealth of small touches (like your characters clothing deteriorating with each narrow escape) and youve got a progressively energetic game set in a fantastic locale: one step beyond everyday life.
Defender,GameCube,Nov-3-2002,Inevitable Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendojo,93,Defender is all about defense which may be a major turn-off for many gamers out there.
RPG Maker,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,Kuusou Kagaku,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Gaming Age,91,While it might not be up to the visual caliber of the current era of RPGs it is a flexible and resourceful title that can bring forth an experience unlike any other - as long as youre willing to fork over the time commitment.

Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers,Switch,May-26-2017,Capcom,Action | Fighting | 2D,Game Over Online,90,Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers delivers a lot of fun even if the overall package could stand to have some room for improvement. The Way of the Hado mode is mere filler but the core game is an absolute blast. Using either the original or revamped art works well and you can alternate between each style along with changing the music from the original to remixes before a full gameplay session. Controlling it with the regular JoyCon setup on either the tablet or the grip works shockingly well – even though the split d-pad is far from ideal. Using the left stick feels natural and you don’t need to rush out and buy a Pro controller to enjoy the full experience.
Ragnarok Odyssey,PlayStation Vita,Oct-30-2012,Game Arts,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Destructoid,90,For all its missteps as an action-RPG it is simply flawless as an example of how to make a Vita experience work. Judicious use of touchscreen controls beautiful visuals a smartly broken-up mission structure and eerily swift loading times makes this the gold standard for Sonys portable.
Neopets Petpet Adventures: The Wand of Wishing,PSP,Mar-14-2006,SCEA,Adventure | 3D | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,BonusStage,79,Sony has a great potential franchise here if they continue to polish and refine the gameplay and visuals with each installment and I’d recommend they take this style of top-down action to the home consoles as well adding even more features.

NFL Head Coach,PlayStation 2,Jun-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Sports | Traditional | Football | Management,Digital Entertainment News,81,It’s not perfect it’s not available on next-gen systems but for control freaks it may be the most exhaustively complete sports SIM ever released on a console.
Hidden Agenda,PlayStation 4,Oct-24-2017,Supermassive Games,Miscellaneous | Party / Minigame,Gaming Age,91,As I said up top there are certainly reasons to be wary of Hidden Agenda. It’s hard not to search a crime scene for clues with your unresponsive PlayLink app and come away wishing that you were just using a plain controller. But that’s more than outweighed by the fact that the game also does a better job of capturing what makes mystery novels so compelling than nearly anything else I’ve ever played. Hidden Agenda may not be perfect but it knows how to keep you hooked right to the very end.
Dragon Age II: Legacy,PC,Jul-26-2011,BioWare,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | Action RPG,PC PowerPlay,90,A surprisingly detailed add-in for this controversially received sequel. New approaches to encounter design and smarter enemies stand out although story remains a strong feature.
Tak: The Great Juju Challenge,DS,Sep-19-2005,Altron,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,BonusStage,77,These mini games were definitely needed too as the story mode itself is exceptionally short clocking in at maybe three hours tops. Equally disappointing there’s no wireless multiplayer of any sort.
