Call of Juarez: The Cartel,PlayStation 3,Jul-19-2011,Techland,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Worth Playing,40,Truly this game is a disappointment on nearly every level.
Dead Horde,PC,Jul-27-2011,DNS Development,Action Adventure | Horror,CD-Action,30,You cant come up with an idea for an interesting varied gameplay your budget is very limited and your breathtaking script is being digested by a dog? Dont worry – just make another mediocre zombie game and publish it on Steam. Someone will buy it. [September 2011 p.73]
Mr. Driller Online,Xbox 360,Apr-2-2008,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,Take the thing online (that is the name of the game after all...) and the results are truly beyond atrocious. [Issue#33 p.116]
Infinity Runner,PlayStation 4,Apr-21-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,SpazioGames,40,Infinity Runner is a failure from every point of view. Born as a PC game and also available on PS4 it hasnt definitely found its place in the market.
Grooverider Slot Car Thunder,Xbox,Sep-26-2003,King of the Jungle,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,40,Slot car racing is bloody boring enough without have to replicate it in a videogame. Whats next? Snail racing?... It stinks.
Generation Zero,PlayStation 4,Mar-26-2019,Avalanche Studios,Action Adventure | Open-World,Gaming Age,33,If you’re the sort of person who enjoys aimless wandering but doesn’t like the idea of getting up off the couch and actually doing it then you might be in luck here. Otherwise don’t bother because it’s absolutely not worth it.
Hard Truck: Apocalypse,PC,Jun-26-2006,Buka Entertainment | Targem Games,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Digital Entertainment News,40,Nuclear holocaust survivors in a post-apocalyptic world filled with people wearing clown masks may find Hard Truck: Apocalypse to be an effective training tool but anyone looking for a good game should look elsewhere.
Hard Rock Casino,PlayStation 2,Nov-27-2006,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling,GamesRadar+,30,Realistic? Yes. Fun? Not one bit. Whats worse is that you have to sit and listen to the other fake players talk smack at the tables with the same four lines of speech. Youll be wise to quickly run to the Options menu and turn the sound off.
Hyperdimension Neptunia,PlayStation 3,Feb-15-2011,Idea Factory | Compile Heart,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GameWatcher,30,Theres precious little to recommend here outside of the occasionally cutesy over-sexed anime visuals and comedy wobbling breasts.
Bravo Team,PlayStation 4,Mar-6-2018,Supermassive Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Digitally Downloaded,40,As a demo it actually works; when I played it for ten minutes in a controlled environment last year I came away quite impressed with it. But those first ten minutes are Bravo Teams limit and Sony should have realised this and pulled the plug on the project as a commercial game a long time ago.
Rodea the Sky Soldier,3DS,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Nintendo Enthusiast,40,If you are a huge fan of NiGHTS it’s worth picking up at a discounted price because there is some fun to be had here: just the fun moments are few and far between.
Smart Bomb,PSP,May-10-2005,Core Design Ltd.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,My advice to the developers is next time skip the shaking the timers and the laughable cinemas and spend more time polishing and testing. [June 2005 p.101]
Catwoman,Xbox,Jul-20-2004,EA Games,Action Adventure | Modern,GamerFeed,40,This game certainly has some really great graphics and animations but it comes up short on being able to keep things moving at an enjoyable pace not to mention that its very difficult to control.
Earthworm Jim 2,Game Boy Advance,May-31-2002,Super Empire,Action | Platformer | 2D,Play Magazine,40,Doesnt anyone anywhere give a rats ass about this franchise anymore? [Aug 2002 p.76]
Shadow the Hedgehog,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2005,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | 3D,GamePro,40,For all the consternation about a gun-toting enigma invading a kid-friendly video-game series the only thing to fear in Segas Shadow the Hedgehog is the games slap-dash excution. [Mar 2006 p.80]
Crash: Mind Over Mutant,DS,Oct-7-2008,TOSE,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,40,Crash: Mind Over Mutant is a competent platformer. While it leaves much to be desired in terms of depth and level design fans of the titular Bandicoot or starved DS platform lovers may enjoy it. Others should pass this one by.
Battlestar Galactica,PC,Oct-23-2007,Auran,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Gamer UK,22,This cheap tacky space combat sim is a stinking mess insulting the name of the series merely by presuming to associate itself with it. [Mar 2008 p.83]
Rodea the Sky Soldier,Wii U,Nov-10-2015,Prope | Kadokawa,Action | Platformer | 3D,Cubed3,40,Rodea the Sky Soldier is simply a game that really needed more time and a course correction. A lot of promising concepts are seen and experienced throughout but the flying and Sonic homing-style combat would have been executed so much better with a bit more polish.
Warriors: Legends of Troy,PlayStation 3,Mar-15-2011,Tecmo Koei Canada,Action | General | General,GameOver.gr,40,It may be surprisingly faithful to the original transcripts even if it gives very little information regarding the Trojan War but that is the only positive aspect of this new western oriented button masher from Koei. This recreation of Homers Epic is extremely shallow and repetitive offering nothing new to the genre.
Ford Bold Moves Street Racing,Xbox,Sep-25-2006,Razorworks Studios,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,IGN,35,But its worthless and Eidos knows it. The game design is so transparent the goal behind the game is so obvious the lack of any morsel of fun is so far from the car and tracks and the playing of it…its just exasperating. This is pure bargain bin trash.
Darkest of Days,Xbox 360,Sep-10-2009,8Monkey Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,TeamXbox,38,While the story had potential for creating a cool juncture between history and science fiction there’s very little flexing of those muscles in the actual product.
The Scourge Project: Episodes 1 and 2,PC,Apr-9-2010,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Edge Magazine,30,Plays unbearably clumsily. [June 2010 p.104]
Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter,PC,Oct-28-2011,Kerberos Productions,Strategy | Turn-Based | General | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi,CPUGamer,30,Bottom line is that on paper this is an incredibly deep and varied game but time and again the reach of the programmers vastly exceeds their grasp. Even months after release theres so little in this game thats working as intended that only the most desperate die-hard fan of the genre should even consider this game.
Zoo Tycoon DS,DS,Oct-11-2005,Altron,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,G4 TV,40,The tiny blocky graphics do little to immerse you into the park and the unwieldy controls make relatively simple actions needlessly difficult.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,PC,Jul-29-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,Second-rate action game is boring for comic devotees and too easy for fighting game fans. Voice cast from the original movie actors can not change anything of this. [Oct 2009]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,PlayStation 4,May-24-2016,PlatinumGames,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Hardcore Gamer,40,The end result is a cluttered mess that constantly tries to keep you active with something anything at random in order to distract you from the poor design.
Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey,Xbox,Aug-5-2003,Vicious Cycle,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Deeko,40,The gameplay is lackluster the musical track is enough to make you fall asleep and the voice acting is so bad that you can’t help but weep.
Superman: The Man of Steel,Xbox,Nov-19-2002,Circus Freak,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Electronic Gaming Monthly,35,Its not as mind-blowingly awful as the old N64 Superman stinker but it is outclassed by nearly every other comic-book game out there. [Feb 2003 p.154]
ESPN National Hockey Night,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,Kush Games,Sports | Traditional | Ice Hockey | Sim,GameSpot,38,National Hockey Nights graphics are solid but its no-frills gameplay modes and abysmal control leech the fun from the game leaving a superficial shell behind.
Watchmen: The End Is Nigh Part 2,Xbox 360,Aug-26-2009,Deadline Games,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,1UP,42,As a stand-alone download its a short rendition of the Watchmen brawler experience that features more low points than high points -- but with an admittedly awesome moment of Rorschach punching a fat pervert.
Hummer Badlands,Xbox,Apr-14-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,Worth Playing,40,If you like racing games play Forza Burnout or Gran Turismo. If you are someone who likes Hummer vehicles go and play Mercenaries to see how it should handle.
TMNT: Mutant Melee,GameCube,Mar-16-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Play Magazine,35,Its hard to find the fun in Mutant Melee whether playing alone or with friends. [May 2005 p.54]
Last Rebellion,PlayStation 3,Feb-23-2010,Hit Maker,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,RPGamer,30,Although the combat system is unique the progressively easy difficulty atrocious story and subpar visuals make Last Rebellion difficult to recommend. Its also incredibly short requiring less than fifteen hours to complete the game.
Chronovolt,PlayStation Vita,Dec-31-2012,Playerthree,Puzzle | Action | General | General,Push Square,30,Chronovolt is a glitchy and unsatisfying title thats hard to recommend. While you may glean some enjoyment from its opening moments the novelty swiftly wears thin. This title is best rolled out of sight and into obscurity.
Dead Island: Ryder White,Xbox 360,Feb-1-2012,Techland,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameShark,33,However Mr. Whites wild ride isnt the only thing included in this package – there are also a few new schematics for making new weapons. These can be accessed in the regular game as well as the DLC. This is a cool feature if youre new to Dead Island or are on a new playthrough but theres not really enough there to warrant paying for the DLC. Dead Island is still a game that deserves to be played if you missed it last year – but Ryder White can be safely skipped.
The Mummy Returns,PlayStation 2,Oct-3-2001,Blitz Games,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Yahoo!,40,Talking of light there are several periods playing as Rick that youll be inching forward down rocky tunnels with virtually no illumination to help you and the 3D map that you can cut to when youre feeling lost is worse than useless.
State of Emergency 2,PlayStation 2,Feb-14-2006,DC Studios,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Computer Games Magazine,30,Flaws like this keep State of Emergency 2 from being anything more than a straightforward third-person shooting gallery. [Jun 2006 p.92]
AeternoBlade II,Switch,Oct-11-2019,Corecell Technology,Action | Platformer | 2D,TheSixthAxis,40,With unenjoyable and clunky combat that is made much worse during the 3D segments a laughably archetypal fantasy story and dated character models it’s hard to actually believe that AeternoBlade II released this year for modern consoles. AeternoBlade II simply falls short of all of its ambitions whatever they might have been.
Fimbul,Switch,Feb-28-2019,Zaxis,Action Adventure | General,Nintendo Insider,40,The end result is that Fimbul is a soulless experience that never amounts to much more than something that will forever represent the developer’s unrealized vision. Throwing the unpredictable bugs glitches and wayward problems that are present on Nintendo Switch into consideration it’s hard to not come to the conclusion that you’d be better off simply leaving it to someone else to prevent Ragnarök from happening.
Golden Axe: Beast Rider,PlayStation 3,Oct-14-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,Playstation Official Magazine Australia,40,A game destined for the chopping block. [Summer 2009 p.78]
MotoGP 08,Wii,Mar-24-2009,Milestone S.r.l,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Motorcycle | Automobile | Street | Street,Vandal,38,MotoGP is one of the most popular titles in the driving panorama however this Wii version hasnt been as lucky as the ones in PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This is a lackluster product which could have hit the billboards.
Hard Rock Casino,PSP,Apr-24-2007,Farsight Studios,Miscellaneous | Parlor | Gambling | Gambling,Pocket Gamer UK,40,Quantity over quality this suite of gambling games fails to capture the thrill of throwing all your money away on the single spin of a wheel.
Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back,PC,Oct-31-2017,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,Destructoid,30,It doesnt feel like much love went into this project in almost every aspect. Its probably the best game in the Bubsy franchise (not saying much) but also lacks some of the few things that really gave Bubsy any definition at all. It just feels like a random platformer with Bubsy plastered all over it because hey remember him? Oh also its thirty dollars. In a year that has brought us a bevvy of amazing platformers some even revitalizing long-dormant series Bubsy is easily left behind.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GamePro,40,Theres no exclusive content just a new way to struggle with already poor combat.
Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey,PC,Nov-8-2007,Akella,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,GameSpot,40,An inferior copy of a classic Swashbucklers isnt worth your time.
Discs of Tron,Xbox 360,Feb-13-2008,Backbone Charlottetown,Action | General | General,Totally360,40,A minor distraction perhaps but classic is reserved for titles that carry fond memories and are still as satisfying to play as they ever were and Discs of Tron just doesn’t fit that description at all.
Splat Renegade Paintball,Xbox,Oct-11-2005,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Alternative | Other,Worth Playing,40,Not only is this game absolutely atrocious but you generally dont want to give a machine a reason to hate you.
Big Mutha Truckers 2,PC,Aug-23-2005,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Play Magazine,20,Foist this game on a hated enemy; its surprising a bomb this big doesnt come ticking. [Oct 2005 p.70]
Warriors Orochi 2,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2008,Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,Play.tm,35,Personally I get a similar amount of pleasure from cleaning the oven or mowing the lawn both of which I can do for free and both of which provide some tangible benefit when Im done rather than just making my thumbs hurt.
Big Beach Sports,Wii,Jun-24-2008,HB Studios Multimedia,Sports | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,36,What a stinker. [Aug 2008 p.101]
The Sacred Rings,PC,Mar-7-2007,Streko-Graphics Inc.,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy,Jolt Online Gaming UK,35,The limited gameplay with an atmosphere that is completely spoiled by some deviously frustrating design and lazy pathing leads to an experience that for most will be flat and lifeless.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,COGconnected,30,There is no question Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark plays and feels like your typical movie tie-in game. Everything about it screams ‘rushed out the door’ to satisfy the needs of all those poor suckers who wasted money watching the big screen stinker.
Tetris Worlds,PlayStation 2,Mar-20-2002,Blue Planet Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Stacking,IGN,38,If youre looking for a rewarding block-dropping experience however save yourself the thirty-five bucks and pick up a portable version. Chances are itll be cheaper more fun and less inclined to promote suicidal megalomania.
NFL QB Club 2001,Dreamcast,Jul-30-2000,High Voltage Software,Sports | Traditional | Football | Sim,GamerWeb Sega,44,Its a damned shame but theres just about no good reason to bring this game into your life.
Q*bert: Rebooted,PlayStation 4,Feb-17-2015,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General | Arcade,Gaming Nexus,35,Not being able to reliably move in diagonal directions makes certain levels near impossible. Q*Bert deserves better.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,Xbox 360,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Games Master UK,30,The characters filling out the world are frankly insultingly stupid and voiced so badly it wouldnt have even been funny in the 90s.[Nov 2014 p.79]
Army Men: Sarge's War,Xbox,Aug-2-2004,Tactical Development,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,TeamXbox,40,The gameplay is horribly repetitive and dull the controls are twitchy the visuals are bland and the audio is laughable.
Pac-Man World 3,DS,Dec-7-2005,Blitz Games | Human Soft,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Nintendo Power,30,Suffers from one of the worst cameras in recent memory killer slowdown and bland levels rife with invisible barriers. [Feb 2006 p.97]
Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D,3DS,Mar-27-2011,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,33,Tyranna-bore-us Rex. Triceraplops.Velocicraptor. You get the picture.
Husk,PC,Feb-3-2017,UndeadScout,Action Adventure | Survival,Areajugones,30,HUSK is full of technical issues and bugs that affect the progress of the story. Great setting but very poor execution. Unplayable.
Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise,PlayStation 3,Oct-8-2012,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,IGN,23,Its only arguably redeeming quality is the way it caters to the same kind of morbid fascination that drives kids to rip the wings off of butterflies or have catered Justin Bieber parties. And if theres any justice in this industry at all that one strength will not be enough to save this dreck from the bowels of the bargain bin.
Johnny Kung Fu,3DS,Jul-12-2012,UFO Interactive,Action | General | General,SpazioGames,40,If a product wants to bring our memories back to when videogames were just lines and beeps it must offer something to still keep us entertained in 2012. Johnny Kung Fu just doesnt have what it takes. There are a way better options for that price in the e-shop. Dont waste your time with this.
FunTown Mahjong,Xbox 360,Jan-28-2009,FunTown World Limited,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Puzzle | Matching | Board / Card Game | Matching,GameFocus,38,Mahjong has been strangely missing from the XBLA. Unfortunately FunTown Mahjong is simply not good enough to fill that niche. Its sloppy presentation is its ultimate downfall from the terrible tutorial to the awful audio-visual.
Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit,Xbox 360,Aug-5-2008,Synetic,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,36,Frustrating cheap and lacking any real depth. A modern Chase HQ this isnt. [Aug 2008 p.80]
Godzilla: Unleashed,Wii,Dec-5-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Fighting | General | 3D,1UP,40,Unleashed isnt completely without merit -- it just falls far below any reasonable standard for fighting wrestling or monster games.
Beowulf: The Game,PC,Nov-13-2007,Ubisoft,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,40,Ubisoft Shanghai and Tiwak did a magnificent job of butchering the reimagining of a classic tale and providing plenty of disposable derivative gameplay to go along with it.
NeverEnd (2006),PC,Oct-2-2006,Mayhem Studios,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GameSpot,33,Unless youre looking for some laughs or a trip down memory lane stay far far away from this one.
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix,PlayStation 2,Dec-26-2001,3DO,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,Official U.S. Playstation Magazine,30,Your magnetic skis do more than just hug the rails when you’re grinding along – they magically suck you toward rails if you’re in the vicinity. It’s ridiculous. [Mar 2002 p.108]
Street Trace: NYC,Xbox 360,Aug-22-2007,Gaia Industries,Simulation | Driving | Car Combat | Car Combat | Vehicle | Combat,Eurogamer,40,There is a place for more substantial 3D games like this on the platform but Street Trace: NYC provides nothing to recommend itself over the slew of more tightly focussed and expressed rivals on the platform.
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,PlayStation 2,Mar-28-2006,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,IGN,37,Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is a very bad game on the PlayStation 2. Its terrible from a technical standpoint and nothing else about its design really brings it out of the gutter.
Harmonix Music VR,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2016,Harmonix Music Systems,Action | Rhythm | Dancing,PlayStation Universe,35,There’s little value and almost no substance in Harmonix Music VR. Its drab modes and environments fail to add anything interesting to the music listening experience.
Cops 2170: The Power of Law,PC,Jan-27-2005,Mist Land,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,My Gamer,34,There’s no tutorial to ease you into the game the manual is overly cryptic there’s no adjustable difficulty level and combat seems almost intentionally tedious.
C.O.R.E.,DS,Aug-11-2009,NoWay Studio,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,GameSpot,35,This archaic first-person shooter is lousy to its core.
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee,Game Boy Advance,Sep-24-2003,Art,Action | Platformer | 2D,IGN,40,The developers should have just stuck with the tried-and-true 2D Prince of Persia-style of the previous Oddworld games for this conversion. Munchs Oddysee is full of little quirks that add up to a very un-fun GBA game that cant even fall back on technical merits.
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern,PC,Aug-13-2001,Ubisoft,Role-Playing | Adventure | General | General,GameSpy,33,A bad adventure game based on far better books. Go read them.
Iron Man,PSP,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,1UP,33,A by-the-numbers affair unlikely to rouse most action fans. Maybe you wont toss your controller in a fit of rage (unlike the frustrating PS3/360 games) but with gameplay and presentation this uninteresting do you even need pick it up to begin with?
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom,GameCube,Nov-4-2003,Konami,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy,Cheat Code Central,40,The Falsebound Kingdom is almost a prophetic title as this inferior product is forced upon the multitude of loyal supporters that are blind to the deception and exploitation employed by the Yu-Gi-Oh Empire.
Mike Tyson Boxing,Game Boy Advance,Mar-6-2002,Virtucraft,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,GameZone,38,Gruesome and indescribably disappointing.
Mike Tyson Boxing,PlayStation,Oct-23-2000,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,Maxim Online,40,There’s no ear biting in Tyson’s animated repertoire (damn!) but there’re plenty of other ways to rearrange your opponent’s face—even though you won’t recognize any of them.
TotemBall,Xbox 360,Oct-4-2006,Strange Flavour,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Official Xbox Magazine,30,If youre not gnashing your teeth trying to make Totem Ball work then youre gritting them in pain because your arms are killing you. [Holiday 2006 p.80]
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,Xbox 360,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Electronic Gaming Monthly,39,That its online component is limited to a linear and moderately laggy co-op mode - and therefore feels even more ponderous than the single-player game - does little to spirit this comic book tie-in from gaming purgatory. [July 2008 p.80]
Vaccine,Switch,Jul-6-2017,Rainy Night Creations,Action Adventure | Survival,Cubed3,20,The idea of implementing roguelike elements and endless game design in old-school survival horror has potential but Vaccine fails to capitalise on it. Aspects where the developers could have improved on were perks that could allow a 180-degree turn a map system or even a combo system where it can be possible to earn back extra time like Resident Evils The Mercenaries mode. With much more variety in level design and more enemies Vaccine could have been an interesting guilty pleasure. In its current state this seems more like pre-alpha build with many of the features not yet implemented.
Cortex Command,PC,Sep-28-2012,Data Realms,Action | Strategy | Real-Time | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D | Command,PC Gamer,40,Occasionally entertaining but plagued by AI bugs and hamstrung by a clunky user interface. Less than the sum of its parts.
NPPL Championship Paintball 2009,Xbox 360,Nov-25-2008,FUN Labs,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine,40,Essentially the only thing that kept us playing the campaign mode was to escape the horrible rap metal in the menu screens. [Mar 2009 p.83]
Iron Man,Wii,May-2-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,n-Revolution Magazine UK,40,If Iron Man Wii looked better and played smoother it would at least be bearable. But it doesnt and it isnt. [Issue#23 p.62]
Black Stone: Magic & Steel,Xbox,Mar-19-2003,Xpec,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,Seems to have sprung up from the sharp minds of bored high school students who probably spent too much time playing Gauntlet. [Winter 2002 p.109]
Ridge Racer,PlayStation Vita,Mar-13-2012,Namco Bandai Games | Cellius,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,SpazioGames,40,Few tracks few cars little fun. Ridge Racer is an ugly demo sold at thirty euro with the amazing idea of expanding the game content through DLC.
Battleship,PlayStation 3,May-15-2012,Double Helix Games,Action | Miscellaneous | Shooter | Board Games | Shooter | Board Games | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Tactical,Playstation Official Magazine UK,40,Theres an element of novelty in the first few minutes of play but it doesnt last long. It isnt even the sketchy gameplay that sinks this Battleship – its the abhorrently commercial objective apparent in every second of rushed gameplay. Theres no artistic vision here and the original idea at its core hasnt been given the time and love needed to build a coherent or enjoyable game.
SunAge,PC,Nov-30-2007,Vertex 4,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer UK,38,Well and truly eclipsed by the passage of RTS history. [Feb 2008 p.79]
Submersed,PlayStation 4,Jul-17-2019,Main Loop,Action Adventure | Survival,TheSixthAxis,30,Submersed takes an interesting and original premise and does virtually nothing good with it. There are elements and ideas of a good game in the bare bones of this but it is all so poorly executed and dull that it is difficult to recommend. The fact that it is a mid-price game on PS4 only compounds this amateur feel as there are hundreds of similar games available on Steam for a couple of quid. In the end this is far more snores than Jaws and lacks any real bite.
Mindjack,PlayStation 3,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,SpazioGames,35,A complete waste of good ideas. Theres really no reason why you should bother buying this mess.
Infinity Runner,Xbox One,Apr-22-2015,Wales Interactive Ltd.,Action | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,Any Temple Run player will be familiar with the basic premise and Infinity Runner does little to shake things up – instead delivering trial-and-error gameplay dodgy production values and repeated.
Tony Hawk Ride,PlayStation 3,Nov-17-2009,Robomodo,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,RealGamer,40,But sadly Ride simply lacks the same quality providing and unimaginative playing experience that never seems to get out of the blocks and you may feel you’ve being taken for a ride with this game especially considering its price!
Combat: Task Force 121,Xbox,Mar-27-2005,Direct Action Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,XGP Gaming,32,From the lackluster graphics to the terrible enemy AI the crappy single-player and the generic online play this game doesnt offer anything you havent seen before.
Empire of Magic,PC,Apr-30-2003,Mayhem Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpy,33,Its poorly designed poorly executed and downright frustrating to play.
Evolution Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,G4 TV,40,Compared to the numerous improvements and mini-games in the incredibly playable Tony Hawks Pro Skater 4 Evolution Skateboarding feels as if it were already on the brink of extinction.
Salt Lake 2002,PC,Jan-23-2002,Attention To Detail,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,PC Gamer,35,After just a half-hour SLC 2002 will be straight in the trash. Its a mathematical certainty. [May 2002 p.77]
Calvino Noir,PlayStation 4,Aug-25-2015,Calvino Noir Ltd.,Action Adventure | General,We Got This Covered,30,An excellent noir aesthetic doesnt save Calvino Noir from its utterly incompetent and buggy gameplay making for an infuriating stealth title.
Tornado,DS,Oct-27-2008,Skonec,Action | General | General,DarkZero,30,Tornado is a title that started with a solid base of fun gameplay mechanics and interesting level design and then buried it under a mound of inexplicably terrible design faults that seem like they were created to generate annoyance.
Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods,PC,Nov-20-2008,Trine Games,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | PC-style RPG | Western-Style,Play (Poland),30,Forsaken gods? Rather forsaken legacy and a blatant ripoff. After two years of development we receive a game with a plethora of bugs jerky graphics and frequent crashes to the desktop a game that strips this franchise of the pitiful remains of its former glory. [Jan 2009]
MilitAnt,PlayStation 4,Jul-12-2016,Xibalba Studios,Action | Platformer | Shooter | 2D | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,GamingTrend,30,There is very little fun to be had in MilitAnt. After spending most of my time breezing through half of the game’s bosses all but submitting to the other half (with a pair of very green exceptions) and rushing past nearly every basic enemy I get the impression that this ubiquitous imbalance in difficulty is more likely a vast oversight than a design choice.
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Sep-3-2008,Blazing Lizard,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Destructoid,35,Ultimately Pirates Vs. Ninja Dodgeball is a waste of time.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King,Game Boy Advance,Jun-24-2003,Natsume,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Cheat Code Central,40,Un-challenging un-fun easy to beat and way too short. It’s such a boring game that the only saving grace is that it’s mercifully short.
Metal Dungeon,Xbox,Dec-15-2002,Panther Software,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Cheat Code Central,40,This game is more of an action adventure without the combat. Its also a little shy on action and adventure.
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor,Game Boy Advance,Jul-16-2001,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Platformer | 2D,GameSpot,36,A smidgen of intellect surrounded by garbage does not make for a good game.
Bombshell (2016),PC,Jan-29-2016,Interceptor Entertainment,Role-Playing | Action RPG,We Got This Covered,30,Bombshell could have been a fine six-hour shooter but the unfulfilling fetch quests uninspired firearms and meddling glitches stretch the story until – like the game’s suicidal aliens – you too beg for death.
Enemy Front,PlayStation 3,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Shooter | Historic | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic,IGN Italia,40,A disappointing return to WWII with sub-par artificial intelligence limited multiplayer support and several annoying bugs.
Terminator Salvation,PlayStation 3,May-19-2009,GRIN,Action | General | General,Gaming Age,33,As a movie game goes it could have been pretty decent if there was a larger variety of enemies and of course the game was about 4 times the length. As is we have another movie licensed game that fails to deliver the goods.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,Xbox 360,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Eurogamer,30,If Churchill had died we might all be speaking German but at least we wouldnt have to put up with nonsense like this.
Star Trek The Video Game,PC,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,35,Its numerous bugs and linear missions make it frustrating to play and the story never grabs you like a good sci-fi adventure should. Even the most devoted of Star Trek fans will be hard pressed to find something to like in Star Trek The Video Game: there are simply too many glaring problems.
Danger Girl,PlayStation,Sep-6-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,IGN,32,Big breasts can go a long way to brightening up any day but with gameplay this dim even these headlights cant light up this game.
Word Puzzle,Xbox 360,Nov-7-2007,InterServ International,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Logic | General,GamesRadar+,30,See as the puzzles get bigger youre actually forced to scroll them onto the screen which will slow you down even more. Save your $10 for something more worthwhile. This isnt even a decent time-waster.
Devil's Third,Wii U,Aug-28-2015,Valhalla Game Studios,Action Adventure | General | Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,NintendoWorldReport,35,With just five hours on the counter barely anything gets time to truly sink in. Add to this the technical issues and the inconsistencies of the presentation and you have a game that could have benefited from a bit more playtesting.
Everreach: Project Eden,PC,Dec-4-2019,Elder Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,PC Invasion,30,This game fails at almost everything it sets out to do. With janky animations embarrassing story awful combat mechanics and horrible enemy layouts and AI theres just not much positive to say about it.
Blood Knights,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2013,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy | Action RPG,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,It’s an awkward mix of Diablo and Soul Reaver that nobody asked for. Something to play if you’ve got a few hours and an itch to bump up your Gamerscore.
Digimon World Data Squad,PlayStation 2,Sep-18-2007,Bec,Role-Playing | General,PSM Magazine,40,The game offers nothing but tedium to older gamers but the six and under crowd may love it. [Nov 2007 p.90]
Six Flags Fun Park,Wii,Mar-3-2009,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | General | Party | Party / Minigame,Video Game Talk,40,If you have a kid and are already planning a trip to Six Flags this is a solid pick-up as this $25 game has a $30 kids admission voucher in it (if you go before the end of 2009) so its basically like getting the game for free. Just be prepared to hear complaints from a soon-to-be bored child a few days after purchase.
Monster Jam,Xbox 360,Nov-13-2007,Torus Games,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Truck | Truck | Automobile,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,39,A game without a reason to live consigned to the scrapheap by the 360s real racers. [July 2008 p.83]
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PC,Mar-23-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,40,Recycled environments mediocre gameplay and the absence of online play cripple this disappointing top-down adventure.
Power Rangers Super Megaforce,3DS,Oct-28-2014,Bandai Namco Games | 7thChord,Action | General,Gamers\' Temple,30,Skip this game and keep your fingers crossed that the next one will be better.
Quantum Theory,PlayStation 3,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,PSX Extreme,35,Quantum Theory is the epitome of awful game design. Uninspired. Underdeveloped. Gray. Some of the worst story telling this generation has seen coupled with some of the worst visuals youll find on your beautiful PS3 or Xbox 360 in addition to level design thatll bore you the minute you lay your eyes on it.
John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland,DS,Nov-20-2007,Black Lantern Studios,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,30,Even if John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland worked perfectly it would be an uninspired unattractive game that beats the player over the head with its sponsor.
New Rally-X,Xbox 360,Dec-27-2006,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Driving | General | General | Arcade,TeamXbox,38,Just be prepared for a game that screams I’m simple (as in I’m mediocre not I’m elegantly designed).
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PC,Jul-12-2011,None,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GRYOnline.pl,35,If you like Harry Potter - dont buy this game. If you like TPP shooters - stay away from this game. If you like good music - buy yourself the official movie soundtrack. If youre the parents of a young teenager - choose anything but this game. Youll hurt your child with it. Dont buy this game because you are voting with your wallet. By paying for this game you allow more of THAT to be developed in the future.
FIFA 20: Legacy Edition,Switch,Sep-27-2019,Electronic Arts,Sports | Team | Soccer | Sim,TheSixthAxis,40,If you’re simply looking to play Career Mode on the go then you may get some mileage out of FIFA 20 Legacy Edition on Switch but if you can buy FIFA on any other platform then we suggest you do. The Switchs FIFA legacy is fast becoming outdated gameplay and missing features and the only way to put a stop to this is to vote with your wallet.
Soldner: Secret Wars,PC,Jun-22-2004,Wings Simulations,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,1UP,40,This game attempts to combine the best aspects of serious tactical shooters like Flashpoint with the run-and-gun action of the Battlefield series but does neither very well. [40 = original score]
Spuds Unearthed,PlayStation 4,Apr-24-2020,Gamedust,Strategy | Real-Time | General,GameGrin,40,There’s a core gameplay loop that could have some substance but it’s surrounded by a confused interface a simply awful tutorial with surface-level complexity that needn’t exist.
Hatred,PC,Jun-1-2015,Destructive Creations,Modern | Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Arcade | Top-Down,GameStar,33,I have to kill everbody. It works but its a primitive piece of garbage. Its so bad its almost funny.
Flushed Away,PlayStation 2,Oct-24-2006,Monkey Bar Games,Action | Platformer | 3D,Boomtown,30,Yet another poor incarnation of a movie (which didn’t do that great anyway) which doesn’t accomplish anything other than giving the player consistent headaches throughout. Blame it on its poor level design repetitive gameplay constant bugs or whatever you like as there are ample pickings.
New Gundam Breaker,PlayStation 4,Jun-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,GamingTrend,35,Between fumbling through the menus mashing your way to a choppy and exceedingly easy victory and clicking through meandering dialogue scenes that hold no weight you’ll find yourself too bored to actually collect all the parts you want to make your perfect Gundam. If you’re itching to fight big robots play Gundam Versus instead. Or go punch that actual Gundam in Japan (don’t do that).
PDC World Championship Darts 2008,PSP,Jun-16-2009,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,AceGamez,40,PDC World Championship Darts 2008 is a game that really has no reason to exist.
PlayStation Move Ape Escape,PlayStation 3,Jul-5-2011,SCE Japan Studio,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,PSM3 Magazine UK,40,A wasted opportunity to show off Move control. [Sept 2011 p.102]
1950s Lawn Mower Kids,DS,Nov-3-2011,Zordix,Miscellaneous | General | General,NintendoWorldReport,40,The game isnt especially good and I cant recommend it. The developer successfully made a game about summer chores feel like a chore but I dont know if that was the point.
Final Fight: Streetwise,PlayStation 2,Feb-28-2006,Capcom,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpot,33,Final Fight: Streetwise doesnt look good doesnt play well and it cant even get its unlockable bonus--the original arcade game--right.
Zathura,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2005,High Voltage Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,RewiredMind,30,To me I wouldn’t even leave this game in the basement as you never know who may find it.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades,Switch,May-14-2020,Bethesda Game Studios,Role-Playing | Western-Style,NintendoWorldReport,40,The Elder Scrolls: Blades is a simple case of a mediocre game on mobile just not holding up on an actual console. Concessions made for mobile play just don’t make sense here. Not to mention when blown up to a TV or even the modest size of the Switch’s screen Blades is pretty ugly. Its a downright joke when compared to the actual full Elder Scrolls game already available on the platform. Unlike other Bethesda mobile offerings like Fallout Shelter Blades is a simplification of a complex game rather than a game built with mobile limitations in mind. When you take away the reason for those limitations you’re left with an ugly mess of a game with nothing to justify its own existence.
Pac-Man Party 3D,3DS,Nov-8-2011,Namco Bandai Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Games Master UK,40,A party without fun is merely a gathering. Played alone this is a bit of a disaster. [Apr 2012 p.96]
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,PlayStation 3,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,PS3bloggen.se,30,Despite the fact that the game is based on a bad movie Double Helix have managed to create a game thats even worse. The graphics and controls go head to head to see whos the worst but to be honest they both equally awful.
Sonic the Hedgehog,PlayStation 3,Jan-30-2007,Sonic Team,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 2D | 3D,Pure Magazine UK,40,Possibly the lowest point in Sonic gaming sloppy camera and terrible level design let this down badly. [Mar 2007 p.53]
Super Dungeon Bros,PlayStation 4,Nov-1-2016,React Games,Action | General,PlayStation Universe,35,Falling short in just about every way a title of this ilk can everything Super Dungeon Bros attempts to do the three year old Diablo III does better. Avoid.
Omerta: City of Gangsters,Xbox 360,Feb-12-2013,Kalypso | Haemimont Games,Simulation | Strategy | General | General | General,GameWatcher,40,I tested the Xbox 360 version of Omerta which controlled fine. The 360 versions of Tropico both had decent performance and the same is true here. As well as working smoothly on a technical level the actual control scheme is well-thought out. It’s clear that Omerta began life with both platforms in mind instead of console being tacked on as an after-thought.
MLB Slugfest 20-04,Game Boy Advance,Mar-18-2003,Handheld Games,Sports | Traditional | Baseball | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,30,It lacks features and control. All you really do is make a few choices and let the game play it all out for you. Its like the battle system in an old-school RPG.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,PlayStation,Aug-18-2000,Acclaim,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Game Revolution,25,If anyone should avoid this game it should be the hardcore ECW fan as they will be the most outraged.
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,Xbox 360,Oct-6-2009,Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,40,An amazing new low for platforming games. [Christmas 2009 p.102]
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z,PlayStation 3,Mar-18-2014,Spark Unlimited | comcept,Horror | Action Adventure | General | Horror | Survival | Linear,GamesRadar+,40,Ninja Gaiden Z is a disappointing entry in the Ninja Gaiden series filled with repetitive enemy encounters cringeworthy pervy jokes and frustrating unbalanced gameplay. This is not the ninja game youre looking for.
America's Army: True Soldiers,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2007,Red Storm Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,TeamXbox,40,A breakdown of the core gameplay mechanic will haunt players early and often in America’s Army: True Soldiers.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,PlayStation 3,Jul-12-2011,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameWatcher,35,For fans of gaming stay well clear. Even as far as movie-tie-ins go this title is the biggest crime to the Harry Potter franchise since Emma Watson decided looking like a public schoolboy is sexy.
The Golden Compass,DS,Dec-4-2007,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PALGN,40,Not even the most dedicated fans of the movie will find this game to be of any interest. Childrens game or not The Golden Compass is well below par and not worth your money.
Myst,DS,May-13-2008,Hoplite Research,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy,Electronic Gaming Monthly,31,This is a weak port that doesnt do Myst justice; its not worth a revisit even for nostalgia. [June 2008 p.87]
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Fortune,PlayStation 4,Mar-24-2016,Team Ninja,Sports | Volleyball | Team,Gameblog.fr,40,A game with a lot of sexy fan service and good graphism but a real lack of action based content that force you to farm to get all the swimsuits.
Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality,PlayStation 4,Dec-3-2016,Bossa Studios,Simulation | Virtual | Career,Destructoid,30,As it stands you should absolutely hold off on Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality for PlayStation VR until the controls are overhauled in the planned update. I ended up having some fun once I learned how to work around those glaring issues to a certain extent but even in the best of times it was a struggle. Its a shame the launch went this way because theres an entertaining VR experience buried in here.
Cruis'n  Exotica,Nintendo 64,Oct-16-2000,Gratuitous Games,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Games Radar,0,Dull unenjoyable and incredibly shoddy failing to deliver even the most basic of racing thrills.
Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Paradox Development,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,TotalGames.net,33,The controls are pretty lousy characters will often merge with each other and scenery and moves feel limited; plus why cant we grapple an opponent when theyre stunned?...Avoid this rubbish at all costs.
Dead Alliance,Xbox One,Aug-29-2017,IllFonic | Maximum Games | Psyop,Action | General | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical,TheXboxHub,30,I was hoping to be blown away by Dead Alliance but a dwindling player base poor gameplay terrible bugs and a lack of content make this just another disappointment within a once great genre.
Will of Steel,PC,Feb-4-2005,Gameyus Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Military | General | Military,Computer and Video Games,40,While the game boasts an impressive array of hardware youre sadly only allowed to play as the forces of the right and just in a linear two-pronged campaign that starts with the US-led invasion of Afghanistan and finishes in Iraq.
Aliens: Colonial Marines,PlayStation 3,Feb-12-2013,Gearbox Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Level7.nu,30,Even after more than seven years in development Aliens: Colonial Marines results in a cavalcade of shattered dreams and lost potential. Almost every element is either broken boring or badly designed and the once fearsome Xenomorphs are now reduced to mindless cannon fodder. To put it simply; its a terrible game.
Rise of the Guardians,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Torus Games | D3Publisher,Adventure | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Sails beneath already low expectations. [Jan 2013 p.91]
Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes,PlayStation 3,Oct-6-2009,LucasArts | Krome Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,InsideGamer.nl,40,Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Republic Heroes is not a great game full of bugs. The gameplay is very repetitive and is skipping once in a while often the camera isn’t positioned right and you can’t see were to go. But the ambiance and the story seem to fit the TV-series very well. Star Wars is one of my favourite film series ever and there are a lot of games out there but Republic Heroes is doing too much in a wrong way to get a positive grade.
Tron,Xbox 360,Jan-9-2008,Backbone Entertainment,Action | General | General,Gamer.nl,30,Once a great game in the arcade now not worth mentioning on Xbox Live Arcade. The controls are way too slow and inaccurate and everything feels so outdated. Not worth 400 points!
Farscape: The Game,PC,Aug-8-2002,Red Lemon Studios,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Computer Games Magazine,40,Farscape the series has been cancelled. The game was not. Nobody wins. [Jan 2003 p.75]
Justice League Heroes,DS,Oct-17-2006,Sensory Sweep,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,Nintendo Power,30,This dull clunky mess of a 3D beat-em-up suffers from sloppy hit detection brutal sllowdown and yawn-inducing levels that throw the same basic grunts at you over and over. [Dec. 2006 p.106]
Gardening Mama 2: Forest Friends,3DS,Apr-29-2014,Racjin,Simulation | Strategy | General | Virtual | Career,Nintendo Life,30,Disappointing all over.
Ben 10: Omniverse,Wii U,Nov-18-2012,Vicious Cycle,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Fantasy | Action | General | General,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,40,A dull game that makes no use of the Wii U functionality. [Jan 2013 p.102]
Hot Wheels: Beat That!,Xbox 360,Sep-26-2007,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,34,With a gazillion top racers on 360 youd have to be bonkers to drive this home. [Feb 2008 p.79]
TMNT: Mutant Melee,Xbox,Mar-15-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Fighting | 3D,Official Xbox Magazine,38,Not even cel-shaded reptiles can save a game cursed with tissue-thin design weak AI and repetitive gameplay. [June 2005 p.78]
Naughty Bear,PlayStation 3,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PlayStation LifeStyle,30,After 20 minutes of gameplay you will have fully exhausted what the game has to show you.
Bliss Island,Xbox 360,Mar-12-2008,Pompom Software,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | General,GameSpot,35,This frustrating collection of minigames is an insult to vacations holidays and every other blissful experience.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,PlayStation,Jul-14-2000,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Hot Games,40,This game needed a hell of a lot more graphics optimization and a bit more work on the control would have been nice too.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark,PlayStation 4,Jun-24-2014,Edge of Reality,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,Digital Spy,40,The storytelling is sloppy the set-pieces are repetitive - and in some cases stolen from past games - while the visuals are dated. Its redeemed only by enjoyable third-person shooter action which comes alive in co-op multiplayer when theres no story holding players back.
Funk of Titans,Xbox One,Jan-9-2015,A Crowd of Monsters,Action | Platformer | 2D,Gaming Age,33,If this game had been free to play I probably would have dismissed many things and given it a higher score but at $8.99 this is one you can definitely skip.
RollerCoaster Tycoon World,PC,Nov-16-2016,Nvizzio Creations,Tycoon | Strategy | Management | Business / Tycoon,GameStar,37,It would be a quite decent theme park simulations if it werent for all those bugs crashes and a sub-par performance.
Air Conflicts: Vietnam,PC,Oct-2-2013,bitComposer Games | bitComposer,Action | Simulation | Flight | Flight | Combat,IGN,35,A terribly executed arcade flight game.
Asphalt 3D,3DS,Mar-22-2011,Gameloft,Driving | Racing | General | General | Arcade | Automobile,games(TM),30,Occasionally playable but just mostly horrible. [Issue#108 p.116]
Fast Draw Showdown,Wii,Jan-4-2010,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Light Gun | Light Gun | Modern,Nintendo Gamer,20,It beggars belief then that someone would consciously make a game that contained only the worst bits of an already atrocious game. [Mar 2010 p.75]
NBA Live 14,PlayStation 4,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,GameSpot,40,The on-court action is so sloppy and unsatisfying that even rubbing defeat in Carmelo Anthonys face loses its appeal. NBA Live needs serious work in just about every aspect in order to raise its game to a respectable level.
Dynasty Warriors 6,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2008,Koei | Omega Force,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpot,40,Even though you can climb higher than ever before in Dynasty Warriors 6 the series as a whole seems stuck on the same wrung.
Justice League: Chronicles,Game Boy Advance,Nov-12-2003,Full-Fat,Action | Platformer | 2D,GamePro,30,The only thing that could have made this slapdash and sloppy game any weaker would have been to throw in Aquaman. [Apr 2004 p.86]
Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games,Xbox 360,Jul-10-2012,Activision,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 3D | 3D,Xbox Achievements,25,Avoid this game at all costs. Assuming you own a Kinect then you will have received a better compilation in the form of Kinect Adventures than anything this game has to offer.
Naughty Bear,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2010,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,Totally360,30,What is most disappointing about Naughty Bear is that it had a good premise. This game could have been really awesome. Unfortunately this game was rushed out the door in an unfinished state.
Deadfall Adventures,Xbox 360,Nov-15-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameOver.gr,40,A missed chance in what could have been a cross between Indiana Jones and Uncharted in a first person shooter environment.
Furu Furu Park,Wii,Jan-17-2008,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Game Almighty,33,Straight up this game just isn’t fun. While it is fun to laugh at while others are playing it it only serves as a humiliation tool for others to mock you for playing. Just steer clear you’ll be a much happier person if you do.
Battle: Los Angeles,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,A pitiful tie-in to a sub-standard movie. [June 2011 p.111]
Rengoku: The Tower of Purgatory,PSP,Apr-26-2005,Neverland,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,games(TM),30,With combat relying on clever use of items and plenty of RPG-esque searching and equipping Rengoku does show some potential but it’s far too little and with so many better-quality titles already on the market it’s definitely too late. [Mar 2006 p.116]
WWE 2K20,PlayStation 4,Oct-22-2019,Visual Concepts,Sports | Individual | Combat | Wrestling,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,Patches may rescue this to some degree. For now it’s an unfinished game which should remain unpurchased by your wallet. [Issue#170 p.86]
Mindjack,Xbox 360,Jan-18-2011,FeelPlus,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Modern | Arcade,Game Over Online,30,The bottom line is the more I played Mindjack the more I wanted to stop playing Mindjack. I made it through to the end but it wasnt without a lot of head-scratching hair-pulling and obscenity-laced tirades.
Enki,PC,Jul-31-2015,Storm in a Teacup,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Riot Pixels,35,Pixel-hunting for small barely noticeable items in dark rooms is a crappy idea for a horror game by itself but timer just adds insult to injury. And don’t bother suffering through this for the story because there is pretty much none of it.
The Legend of Alon D'ar,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2001,Stormfront Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,GameSpot,35,Although it features reasonably unique character designs interesting concepts and a huge explorable world Legend of Alon Dar fails in execution with substandard quality in nearly every respect.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000,Dreamcast,Sep-29-1999,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,Planet Dreamcast,40,Not an awful game. It just isnt a good game. It isnt anything. It feels like it happened by accident (an artist tripped and accidentally made a McGrath model).
Venetica,Xbox 360,Jan-11-2011,Deck 13,Role-Playing | Third-Person | Third-Person | General,Destructoid,30,Maybe they did bite off more than they could chew but they at least had aspiration. None the less Veneticas over-ambition is its own downfall. The many imperfections that would be ironed out from larger more successful RPGs have not been attended to rendering the game as frustrating which is a pity.
One Piece: Romance Dawn,3DS,Feb-11-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Role-Playing | General | General,Nintendojo,33,Romance Dawn is a misfire all around that only the absolute most completist of One Piece fans should give it a look. It’s a shame because One Piece is normally something quite wonderful. Such a waste.
Game Tycoon,PC,Mar-22-2006,Tri Synergy,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,GamerNode,25,This game is 2 inches deep and I found myself frustrated bored and maybe even a little angry at the problems with this game. Top this sundae of hate off with bland and boring music and youve got a solid reason to pass on this one at the game stores. Even in the bargain bin.
Iron Man,PlayStation 3,May-2-2008,Secret Level,Action | General | General,Gameplayer,30,This product is too crude for even the ‘mainstream’ demographic; it can only possibly appeal to the ignorant.
Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime,PlayStation 3,Mar-22-2011,Behavior Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Eurogamer,40,With the mood alternating between boredom and exasperation Sanctum Of Slime is a spirit-crushing exercise that only a committed masochist could appreciate.
Stormrise,PC,Mar-24-2009,Creative Assembly,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,PC Gamer UK,35,An awful vision of strategys future. [May 2009 p.69]
Star Trek The Video Game,Xbox 360,Apr-23-2013,Digital Extremes,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Gaming Age,33,Overall other than maybe a rental or picking up one day in a bargain bin there is very little I can say to recommend this mediocre attempt with a big budget license.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,PlayStation 4,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,Areajugones,30,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle features poor battles and a serious camera issues that erase the fun of the fights. Very few game modes and a dull story mode are the reason that this game is no good for any fan of this genre.
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,M4 Limited,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cheat Code Central,30,I would have had more fun gluing spray-painted macaroni to my ass than playing Mission Impossible: Operation Surma on the GBA.
Dino Island,PC,Aug-24-2002,Monte Cristo Multimedia | Monte Cristo,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,IGN,35,In short this game sucks dont buy it for yourself or anyone you love.
Jazz and Faust,PC,Jun-13-2002,Saturn+,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Modern,Adventure Gamers,40,While it remains an innovative and highly laudable idea which I hope will one day be put to better use in Jazz and Faust it fails to be more than a misguided gimmick. The ‘two adventures in one’ angle fails because even with this feature the game is extremely short.
The Sopranos: Road to Respect,PlayStation 2,Nov-7-2006,7 Studios,Action Adventure | Modern,Eurogamer,30,As we perch on the cusp of a bold new console generation theres simply no justification for games this anaemic and sloppy especially at full price. Even in its best moments The Sopranos is dull shallow and repetitive - a game already five years past its sell-by date.
Final Fight: Streetwise,Xbox,Feb-28-2006,Secret Level,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GameSpot,33,Final Fight: Streetwise doesnt look good doesnt play well and it cant even get its unlockable bonus--the original arcade game--right.
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Double Helix Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Gamers' Temple,32,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra The Video Game is just plain awful. Whatever you do though dont let me stop you from seeing the movie. Youll love it.
Fear Effect Sedna,PC,Mar-6-2018,Sushee,Role-Playing | General,CD-Action,25,Sedna simply does not understand games from which it supposedly draws. [06/2018 p.77]
Block Factory,3DS,Apr-26-2012,Enjoy Gaming,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | General,Nintendo Gamer,34,A poorly designed game that allows you to create more poorly designed games then inflict them on other unfortunates. [June 2012 p.106]
Time and Eternity,PlayStation 3,Jul-16-2013,Image Epoch | Imageepoch,Role-Playing | Console-style RPG | Console-style RPG | Japanese-Style,GameCritics,30,Time and Eternitys veneer is gorgeous but style doesnt trump substance—and the substance here leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Toki and Towa may love Zach the Alleged Protagonist but I sure dont.
MC Groovz Dance Craze,GameCube,Nov-22-2004,Mad Catz,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Dancing,IGN,27,The simple truth is that the generic MC Groovz Dance Craze is a broken GameCube game. The dance work doesnt match with the music and therefore the titles dance challenges are not fun.
Bloodforge,Xbox 360,Apr-25-2012,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Sweden,30,Bloodforge is a God of War for Xbox except that its not very good at all. Its a promising idea turned to nothing by too many mistakes.
ArchLord,PC,Oct-3-2006,NHN Corporation,Role-Playing | Massively Multiplayer Online | Massively Multiplayer | Fantasy | Fantasy,GamesRadar+,40,The art design is solid though technologically the graphics dont impress at all. At press-time the chat is nightmarish and the user interface a pale shadow of other MMOs well thought systems.
Contra: Rogue Corps,Switch,Sep-24-2019,Konami,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Top-Down,Nintendo Life,40,Contra: Rogue Corps has some good ideas. The twin-stick action could have worked if it hadn’t been so fussy and inaccurate the choice of characters could have been great if they’d had a bit more variety and the deep customisation and online game modes could have added longevity if they hadnt been attached to such a drab and messy-looking game. In the end nothing about this endeavour feels in any way related to the Contra games you know and love and you’d do much better to grab the Contra Anniversary Collection at a much lower price – or try out one of the many excellent retro twin-stick shooters or side-scrolling action games already available on the platform.
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,PlayStation 4,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | GameMill Entertainment,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,LaPS4,38,Nickleodeon Kart Racers is another bad attempt after all that born covered under the idea of Mario Kart in this case this game has no ambition we got presented a boring dry game and the only people that could make this game fun are kids that don’t have Fortnite on their console.
Coraline,Wii,Jan-27-2009,Papaya Studios | Papaya Studio,Adventure | General | General,The A.V. Club,25,Spending a lot of time on a task can be satisfying but it doesn’t feel that way when the big payoff is delivering a missing piece of paper to complete a fetch quest. Instead the game manages to suck out all the wonder out of Coraline’s rich story and setting leaving only tedium behind.
Beyond the Law: The Third Wave,PC,Apr-2-2004,Magnum Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameBiz,36,It’s not a terribly good team-based strategy – in fact only if you’re a team-based strategy freak should you pick up this title as it offers very limited gameplay and extremely limited enjoyment as you struggle through the ongoing clobbering that Magnum Games likes to call missions.
Clash of the Titans,Xbox 360,Jul-27-2010,Game Republic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,IGN,30,Clash of the Titans is the not only one of the worst license games Ive ever been tasked with reviewing but is also just an awful game in every sense you can think of. Its ugly as sin has terrible character animations and voice acting and feels like it should cost next to nothing as opposed to as much as a retail game.
Brave: A Warrior's Tale,Xbox 360,Aug-4-2009,Collision Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Platformer | General | Historic | 3D,Deeko,30,Brave: A Warriors Tale has done the almost impossible: surpassed Superman 64 for one of the worst games of all time.
Zumba Fitness: Join the Party,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2010,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Sports | Miscellaneous | General | Exercise / Fitness,Console Monster,30,She likened the game to the various dance routine videos she owns which I feel is a fitting comparison for Zumba Fitness for Kinect; a non-interactive set of dance routines where you try to replicate the on screen trainer with little to no feedback or interaction. Then again if you wanted a non-interactive dance routine video you could buy something like Carmen Electra Strip Aerobics and follow that instead of Zumba Fitnesss rainbow rhythms disco sensation.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PlayStation 3,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,The guns are useless. [May 2008 p.112]
Family Party: 30 Great Games,Wii,Dec-2-2008,Tamsoft,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,SpazioGames,30,Family Party: 30 Great Games on Nintendo Wii focuses the gameplay on the multiplayer component and offers 30 different challenges sorted by categories. Too bad it’s not funny and technically awful.
SPRay,Wii,Dec-3-2008,EKO Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,NintendoWorldReport,30,With all its problems SPRay is a pretty terrible game. The basics of the gameplay are promising but it never becomes anything of substance. While the camera control is far and away the games worst problem it also suffers from lackluster puzzles bland combat and an awful overworld.
KURSK,PC,Nov-7-2018,Jujubee,Action Adventure | Survival,CD-Action,35,If it weren’t for the title related to a real submarine and the horrible tragedy of its crew no one would care about Kursk – and we would have missed absolutely nothing. It’s a dated terribly boring (both in terms of gameplay and the story) and generally poorly made game. [01/2019 p.54]
Hello Neighbor,Xbox One,Dec-8-2017,tinyBuild,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,Stevivor,35,A mish-mash of concepts and half-cooked ideas that are never fully developed wrapped up in a cutesy aesthetic that is at odds with its (at times) dark and disturbing themes. This is one to avoid.
Steel Horizon,DS,Mar-20-2007,Climax Group | Climax Studios,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,G4 TV,40,The missions feel boring and repetitive after a while and the combat is a mess. While the story is solid and the overall presentation of the game is pretty good the floundering gameplay manages to sink the entire fleet.
Stranger,PC,Mar-26-2008,Fireglow,Strategy | Real-Time | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,PC Gamer UK,35,A startlingly awful interface. [June 2008 p.89]
Rock Revolution,PlayStation 3,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,IGN,30,Playing Rock Revolution is like getting kicked in the teeth and not in a rock n’ roll way. The cover songs are bad the gameplay is unintuitive and dull the options are extremely limited and the drum peripheral is horrid.
MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2015,Rainbow Studios,Racing | General | Arcade | Automobile,Push Square,30,Sadly those looking for their MX vs. ATV fix are much better off waiting for Rainbow Studios to develop a new installment in this series specifically for the PS4.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Fatal Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Oct-26-2010,Telltale Games,Adventure | General | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,40,One day someone will nail this series and make a game that does its mystery characteristics justice but were stuck waiting until then. [Issue#66 p.91]
Go! Sports Skydiving,PlayStation 3,Feb-7-2008,Light Weight,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Other | Other,Eurogamer,30,As interesting an idea as Sky Diving is sadly the concept fails to deliver thanks to clunky motion sensing.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,PlayStation 3,Mar-30-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,GameWatcher,30,A lazily cobbled-together bargain basement piece of shovelware that deserves neither your time or money.
Smashing Drive,Xbox,May-13-2002,Namco,Driving | Racing | Futuristic,IGN,33,Makes a good gag gift or gag rental if there is such a thing.
ATV: Quad Power Racing,PlayStation,Aug-23-2000,Climax Group,Driving | Racing | Rally / Offroad,CNET Gamecenter,30,Insanely unoriginal environments and play options steal the horsepower from this all-terrain racer.
TMNT,DS,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Quebec,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,31,Quite simply a rotten game with woefully little variation in gameplay and turgid mechanics. Theres very little fun here an dits cetainly a long way from cowabunga dude. [May 2007 p.78]
Arcania: The Complete Tale,PlayStation 3,Aug-30-2013,Spellbound,PC-style RPG | Western-Style | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,RPGamer,40,ArcaniA is just an altogether frustrating experience. Its few good points fail to shine through in any way thanks to the vast number of technical and design issues. Even a fun battle system cant do much for the game other than highlight even further the wasted potential.
Xiaolin Showdown,PlayStation 2,Nov-14-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,GamesRadar+,30,Xiaolin Showdown is a bad game plain and simple. In a genre where speed and chaos is an important part of gameplay Xiaolin Showdown’s fights are out and outright tedious.
Tennis World Tour,Xbox One,May-22-2018,Bigben Interactive,Sports | Individual | Tennis,ZTGD,25,Tennis World Tour is a mess of a game. The AI is a joke that makes it too easy to beat the modes are lacking there are glitches galore and I honestly think the support for this game is not happening which means that online multiplayer may very well never come. If you’re looking for a Tennis game to sink time into I would say stick to something else. Anything else really. This one is not worth your time or your money.
Hellboy: The Science of Evil,PSP,Jun-24-2008,Krome Studios,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Linear,Video Game Talk,40,The game feels unfinished and sloppy from start to finish with a terrible story to back it up and greatly varied presentational merits.
Spider-Man 2: The Game,PC,Jun-28-2004,Fizz Factor,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Computer Gaming World,30,This game just feels like an insult. Or maybe a practical joke. [Nov 2004 p.80]
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,PlayStation 2,Jan-13-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Armchair Empire,38,At a time where Star Trek is at its lowest popularity an abysmal game like this will not win over any new fans and is a horrid example of the Star Trek franchise.
Iron Man 2,Wii,May-4-2010,High Voltage Software,Action | General | General,Gamer.no,30,Rome wasnt built in a day but Iron Man 2 might have been. The game had potential but a rushed production and poor craftsmanship diminishes the joy of controlling Iron Man.
Winter Sports 2: The Next Challenge,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2008,49Games,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skiing | Skiing | Ski / Snowboard,Play.tm,35,Ignoring as is really only fair the poor timing of its release theres still a multitude of reasons why you shouldnt spend your hard earned money on Winter Sports: The Next challenge 2009. Mow the lawn look at the lambs or just enjoy the extra daylight whatever you do with these warm spring days make sure its more enjoyable than playing this.

Legacy: Dark Shadows,PC,Nov-19-2004,Razbor Studios,Adventure | 3D | First-Person | Fantasy | Third-Person | Fantasy,PC Gamer,27,Making matters far far worse is the games tendency to randomly crash to the desktop when you enter new areas. If you must play this game (and I emphasize the word if) remember to save often. [Apr 2005 p.73]
Planet of the Apes,PC,Sep-19-2001,Visiware Studios,Action | Action Adventure | General | General,All Game Guide,40,The manner in which the screen moves can actually make you sick and the enjoyment isnt enough to overcome that aspect.
Iron Man 2,Xbox 360,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,35,A poor-quality marketing tie-in. [July 2010 p.81]
Wayward Manor,PC,Jul-15-2014,Moonshark,General | General | Adventure | Point-and-Click,games(TM),30,It’s hard to understand why the game exists. Did Gaiman desperately want to attach himself to an ugly boring puzzle game? Did the Odd Gentleman really think this was the best way to display his work? It’s more of a mystery than the actual story of Wayward Manor itself.
Things on Wheels,Xbox 360,May-12-2010,Load Inc.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GamePro,40,While many maps have some great design choices Things on Wheels feels like a dated and out of place title that may have been more accepted in the earlier stages of Microsofts Arcade platform.
Cyberball 2072,Xbox 360,Sep-5-2007,Digital Eclipse,Sports | General | General | Team | Futuristic,Xbox World 360 Magazine UK,40,Youll need to be a serious American football/robot fan to get stuck in now. [Dec 2007 p.96]
Transformers: Cybertron Adventures,Wii,Jun-22-2010,Next Level Games,Action | Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,38,Repetitive short and uninteresting are good ways to describe the play experience found in Cybertron Adventures.
25 to Life,Xbox,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,1UP,30,Pandering to every college student and aspiring rap artists deep-seated Scarface fantasies 25 to Life is a 3D action-shooter that not only fails to innovate on any level but rolls back design and technological advancements to the early PSone era.
Arcania: Fall of Setarrif,PC,Oct-24-2011,Spellbound,Role-Playing | PC-style RPG | General | Action RPG | PC-style RPG,Games.cz,30,Setarrif ends as soon as it starts and that defines its final score. You play it for the sole purpose to finish it quickly. If we take its low difficulty and a lack of a great story then the quick finish is not a problem at all.
Mana Khemia: Student Alliance,PSP,Mar-10-2009,Gust,Role-Playing | General | General | Japanese-Style,GamerNode,30,The original game was mediocre to begin with and the PSP version only serves to degrade what was already a less-than-enrapturing gameplay experience in a nearly direct port that suffers from a myriad of technical issues. Avoid.
Damnation,PC,May-22-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,34,A sad story. The game had an interesting concept and a good amount of potential but it just never came together.
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,DS,Jun-17-2008,Farmind Ltd,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,GamingExcellence,34,So go outside read a book or just pick your nose for a couple of hours. Wacky Races: Crash & Dash isn’t worth it.
One Way Trip,PlayStation 4,Aug-30-2016,Beret Applications LLC,Action | General,Push Square,30,Its a confounding mess of bright colours bizarre characters and unpleasant sights and sounds – but then again maybe thats entirely the point. Either way this is a disappointing bare-bones visual novel and frankly were glad that the trip is over.

Emergency Heroes,Wii,May-27-2008,Ubisoft Barcelona | Ubisoft Reflections,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,1UP,33,Its the wide-ranging lack of polish that really damns Emergency Heroes to a forgettable existence as the player vehicles have all the floaty steering and shaky physics of a shovelware budget title (but with twice the price tag) and I even managed to crash the game by falling through the ground during one mission.
7554,PC,Jul-20-2012,Emobi Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,CD-Action,30,Instead of a breathtaking war spectacle it offers a half-baked puppet show that just cant fool anybody. [June 2012 p.75]
GT Pro Series,Wii,Nov-14-2006,MTO,Driving | Racing | Simulation | GT / Street | GT / Street | Automobile,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,40,GT Pro Series has got decent cars and passable handling but the below average physics and utterly shameful visuals give this a cheap unfinished feel.

MotionSports Adrenaline,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | General | General,XboxAddict,30,It wont take too long to unlock everything in the game and once youre done playing each event a few times theres very little reason to keep on playing unless you really want to move up the leaderboards by beating scores.

The Golden Compass,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameDaily,30,The camera moves about uncontrollably making it hard to navigate certain areas or get a lock on enemies. Do not walk in this games direction.
Gungrave VR,PlayStation 4,Dec-11-2018,IGGYMOB,Action | Shooter | Light Gun,Worth Playing,30,Gungrave VR is a game that not only tarnishes its own legacy but also leaves a bad impression of VR as a whole. The gameplay is shallow as attacks feel slow and lack any sort of impact. The limited nature of the stages and the lack of any intelligent enemy combat makes the affair boring but the clunky implementation of VR is what really drags down the game. The VR feels unnatural and it doesnt safeguard one from getting nausea. Theres still hope that the upcoming sequel will fare better especially if it sticks with more traditional gameplay elements and presentation but this VR take is one that players can easily skip.

Seduce Me,PC,Jan-2-2013,None,Strategy | General | General,Vandal,40,The last thing we will do in Seduce Me is seduce someone. This is a card game that will show us naked ladies but theres little value to our actions or decisions.

Dragon's Lair,Xbox 360,May-18-2012,Digital Leisure Inc. | Digital Leisure,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Arcade | Interactive Movie,XGN,30,Dragons Lair is not the game youre looking for on Xbox Live. The controls dont work well and you dont need a lot of time to beat the entire game. So leave your sword where it is because Dragons Lair doesnt ever make you feel like a knight.
American Idol,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Hothouse Creations,Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music,Gamer.tv,40,Overall it seems like the production attitude was to quote the Simon Cowell-managed Westlife Hey whatever. A very poor cash-in and one to avoid.

007 Legends,PlayStation 3,Oct-16-2012,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Gameplanet,35,A clear attempt to cash in on 49 years of Bond goodwill and the gaming ignorance of many of the Christmas-present-buying public 007 Legends is a game that belongs in the previous generation but even then it would have been tough to recommend.

Iron Man 2,PlayStation 3,May-4-2010,Sega Studios San Francisco,Action | General | General,Gamereactor Sweden,30,One of the worst games this year so far - a soulless movie tie-in with a broken control scheme crappy graphics repetitive missions and a terrible story. Just stay away from this heap of rusty scrap metal and go see the movie instead.
Dollhouse,PlayStation 4,May-24-2019,Creazn | Soedesco,Adventure | General,PSX-Sense.nl,35,A great concept does not automatically make for a great videogame especially when the execution is this lacklustre. In this case the repetitive gameplay long loading times and awful graphics are the main detractors. The intriguing multiplayer set-up couldve been a saving grace but is ultimately hampered by a severe lack of players. Shame.
Star Trek: Shattered Universe,Xbox,Jan-14-2004,Starsphere Interactive,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Large Spaceship,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,Its just a bad game with crappy cinemas and more than enough frustrating moments to make you weep into your Romulan Ale. [Dec/Jan 2004 p.89]
Nickelodeon Kart Racers,Switch,Oct-23-2018,Bamtang | Maximum Games,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,FNintendo,30,With a disappointing selection of series and characters available a poor visual environment faulty controls and a soundtrack that would need a complete overhaul this is a passable game that will not satisfy anyone.

Alekhine's Gun,PC,Mar-11-2016,Maximum Games,Historic | Action Adventure | General,Game World Navigator Magazine,37,Biggest problem of AG isn’t the story or lackluster graphics but its incredibly poor AI. Should you cause an alarm every guard on the level will blindly run to that spot letting you shoot them one by one without even changing position. At some point you start to wonder – why bother trying to stealth around if it’s so much easier to just kill everyone? [Issue#209 p.63]
Tank Beat,DS,Jun-1-2007,MileStone Inc.,Action | Simulation | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,GameZone,31,There is nothing in this game that represents fun. I hate to say that but when all the members of the house give it a try and no one could say anything good about it well that just seals the deal.
The Polar Express,GameCube,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,31,An ugly collection of poorly conceived minigames The Polar Express is a failure by the standards of any medium.
Around the World in 80 Days,Game Boy Advance,Jul-5-2004,Saffire,Action Adventure | Modern,AceGamez,30,There arent any two player options and the main game is remarkably short. There isnt anything to make you want to play Around The World In 80 Days again particularly not the tedious and often frustrating gameplay.
Evil Dead: Hail to the King,PC,Mar-28-2001,Heavy Iron Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,PC Gameworld,33,The graphics are poor the gameplay boring and even Bruce Campbell can’t save the game. It’s not even worth it in the bargain-bin.
Naval Assault: The Killing Tide,Xbox 360,Jun-15-2010,Artech Studios,Simulation | Submarine | Submarine | Marine | Combat,ZTGD,40,A disappointment all around. Fans of the genre will scoff at the visuals and simplicity while more casual players will grow bored of its tedious missions and slow-paced gameplay.
The Chaos Engine (2013),PC,Aug-29-2013,Abstraction Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Top-Down,GameStar,28,Quotation forthcoming.
Space Raiders,GameCube,Apr-19-2004,Taito Corporation,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Nintendophiles,32,The two-player mode adds no value to Space Raiders because there isn’t enough substance to the gameplay in the first place. There’s no sense of challenge and there is little fun since dodging and shooting at the same spot in a street is so undeveloped for games these days.
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,Game Boy Advance,Nov-5-2003,Digital Eclipse,Action | General,GameSpot,38,Its a collect-a-thon thats not so big not so deep and not so tall and its also devoid of the fun thats craved by all.
Ducati World Racing Challenge,Dreamcast,Feb-13-2001,Attention To Detail,Driving | Racing | GT / Street,AllDreamcast,20,This is yet another insult to Dreamcast owners and no one should have to suffer through it. Ducati World Racing Challenge is racing at its absolute worst.
Ace Banana,PlayStation 4,Oct-13-2016,TVR,Action | General,Hardcore Gamer,30,Everything is just far too repetitive (not to mention tiring) to get folks through the campaign. A co-op mode didn’t even make it out in time for launch which could have at least added some reason to keep playing. Ace Banana may be technically sound but it’s plainly uninteresting when compared to the rest of PSVR’s launch lineup.
DRIV3R,PC,Mar-15-2005,Reflections Interactive,Driving | Action Adventure | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Open-World | Automobile,Jolt Online Gaming UK,35,You might be more interested to know what Driv3r isn’t though – a good game.
Screwjumper!,Xbox 360,Nov-14-2007,Frozen Codebase,Action | General | General,Eurogamer,40,Charging 800 points for this when the aforementioned Castlevania: SotN comes at the same price is taking the proverbial. Steer well clear of this one.
Made Man: Confessions of the Family Blood,PC,Apr-23-2007,Silverback Studios,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,GameZone,31,Utterly horrendous in every conceivable aspect.
Chronus Arc,3DS,Oct-1-2015,Kemco,Role-Playing | Japanese-Style,Digitally Downloaded,20,There’s nothing to actually recommend about Chronus Arc. Fans of 16-bit and earlier JRPGs won’t get the nostalgic rush they might hope for from this game because it’s so artificially put together it feels more like an insult to the memory of those games than a celebration of them.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,Wii U,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Worth Playing,40,Very little is enticing about Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DONT KNOW! outside of the license being used and even that isnt applied properly here.
Emergency Mayhem,Wii,Apr-15-2008,Supersonic Software,Driving | Racing | Mission-based | Arcade | Mission-based | Automobile,Eurogamer,30,Inevitably its the mini-games that really muff things up though.
Protothea,Wii,Jun-2-2008,Digital Builders | Sabarasa Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Scrolling | Scrolling | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Metro GameCentral,30,Impossibly slow 2D shooter whose only worth is to prove what artistry goes into its betters.
Psychotoxic,PC,Feb-25-2005,NuClearVision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Armchair Empire,30,Such is the nature of a bad game though; if its bad it would have always been and always will be bad.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PC,Feb-13-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Absolute Games,27,Zombies in jungle and abandoned temples – that’s a nice setup for a Left 4 Dead campaign. Unfortunately Rebellion is not Valve. Repeatedly press button on-screen to survive torture says a hint message during one of the interactive cutscenes. Oh I wish there was a button to erase Shellshock 2 from my memory.
Underground Pool,DS,Jan-26-2007,FrontLine Studios,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,IGN,35,There is nothing good to say about Underground Pool. Everything about it is either frustrating boring or stupid.
Freedom: First Resistance,PC,Dec-14-2000,Red Storm Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,GameSpot,39,Freedoms total lack of action is complemented by a complete absence of adventure leaving only bland graphics and a general sense of tedium to fill the giant void that exists between installing the game and finishing it.
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision,PlayStation 2,Apr-23-2007,Namco Bandai Games America,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,IGN,37,With all of the gameplay here being decidedly sub-par the third volume should just scrap any remnants of gameplay and become one long non-interactive cutscene. Put it onto a DVD and charge fans of the show $10 to get more of their fix but for the love of that is good in gaming just dont make a game out of it.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,WayForward,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Push Square,30,Its not entirely without entertainment value – kids will no doubt get a kick out of the license – but its longevity to even the most faithful followers is severely limited. Weve got no time for this adventure.
Xiaolin Showdown,Xbox,Nov-15-2006,BottleRocket Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Official Xbox Magazine,30,As a community we must save the children...from mediocre cartoon-based cideogame adaptations like this one! [Holiday 2006 p.76]
Painkiller: Hell & Damnation,PlayStation 3,Nov-26-2013,The Farm 51,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Push Square,30,Nostalgia is a powerful thing – but in some cases it can be problematic. The industry has certainly moved on from the days when games such as Painkiller: Hell & Damnation were commonplace and while its not unreasonable to look back on these times with fondness that doesnt mean that this lazy rehash deserves your attention. This is a shining example of corner-cutting outdated ideas and in truth is a complete waste of your time.
Farming Simulator,PlayStation 3,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,Appalling textures clunky systems and gameplay you have to shake yourself away from. [Dec 2013 p.95]
Escape Dead Island,PlayStation 3,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,Slant Magazine,30,The developer attempts to justify non sequiturs with a psychological narrative that distorts reality but the twists only become more and more meaningless as the escape progresses.
Inner Chains,PC,May-18-2017,Telepaths Tree,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,Vandal,40,The art design is amazing but thats pretty much all that it is. Performance and gameplay issues prevent this game from being something much better.
The Warriors: Street Brawl,Xbox 360,Sep-23-2009,CXTM,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Destructoid,40,It can be fun but the pacing is annoying and the difficulty will frustrate all but the devoted.
Brain Boost: Gamma Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Eurogamer,30,505 Game Street has been commercially smart to jump aboard the Brain Training bandwagon quickly but it has made a huge mistake in throwing a faceless copycat effort out there. Hopefully people will not be remotely fooled - were certainly not.
MTV Sports: Skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald,PlayStation,Sep-12-2000,Darkblack,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,Happy Puppy,30,Horrible control lousy graphics and a migraine-inducing frame rate all add up to one of the worst games on the market. If you want skateboarding action just stick to Tony Hawk.
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,PlayStation 2,Sep-19-2006,Mechanic Arms,Action | Fighting | 3D,GamesRadar+,30,If you dont care how broken and rudimentary this game is as long as its like the show youre going to be in a fury in no time.
Blood Drive,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,Sidhe Interactive,Simulation | Driving | Racing | General | General | Vehicle | Combat,Gamer.no,30,Guns cars and zombies are apparently not enough. The lack of the all important fun factor ruins most of the fun you could have had running down zombies with your fancy muscle cars.
Prison Break: The Conspiracy,Xbox 360,Apr-1-2010,ZootFly,Adventure | General | General,Play.tm,32,When the only reason youre compelled to continue playing a game is to point and laugh at how badly the entire thing has been thrown together you know that it has major problems.
Freestyle Street Soccer,Xbox,Mar-25-2004,Silicon Dreams,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,GMR Magazine,40,Theres also a full set of uninteresting urban ethnic stereotypes rendered in starkly dated graphics and loudmouth fake gangsta sound bites. [Mar 2004 p.85]
Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu,Game Boy Advance,Nov-24-2003,Webfoot Technologies,Action | Fighting | 2D,Pocket Games,40,There are better fighting games out there for GBA even for hardcore fans of Dragon Ball Z. [Spring 2004 p.40]
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,PlayStation 3,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gameplanet,30,Add Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse to the list of licensed games that fail to deliver an experience that challenges entertains and stands apart from its source material.
The Golden Compass,PlayStation 3,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,IGN,35,Even if you were completely charmed by Philip Pullmans work or enjoyed the movie adaptation theres absolutely no reason to give this game a try. Even the music as pretty as it is cant redeem such poor gameplay and atrocious presentation.
Scourge: Outbreak,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2013,Tragnarion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,SpazioGames,30,Only an incurable dependence on third-person shooter will push you to buy this title. Move over. Seriously theres nothing here that can attract your interest.
MotionSports,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft Milan,Sports | General | General,GameSpot,35,With deeply flawed motion controls and a number of other issues MotionSports fumbles all its potential.
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,Xbox 360,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action | Action Adventure | Fantasy | Platformer | Fantasy | 3D,GameSpot,30,Dull repetitive and carelessly programmed dont even begin to sum up how crummy this action game based on the Looney Tunes license is.
Real Steel,Xbox 360,Oct-12-2011,Yuke's,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,IGN,30,A prime example of a film-to-game adaptation gone wrong. It perpetuates the stereotype that games based on movies arent good with a missed opportunity to use established mechanics effectively.
Soldier Elite,PC,May-29-2006,Metropolis Software,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | General,PC Format,32,Fill your house with treacle and grenades instead. Thats actually more fun. [Sept 2005 p.102]
Deep Black: Reloaded,PC,Apr-18-2012,Biart,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Arcade,GameSpy,30,With apologies to The Little Mermaid perhaps third-person shooters arent one of those things thats much better down where its wetter under the sea.
Battle: Los Angeles,Xbox 360,Mar-11-2011,Saber Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,games(TM),30,A lifeless carcass in the FPS mould lies in its wake. [Issue#109 p.104]
Montague's Mount,PC,Oct-9-2013,Polypusher Studios,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror,COGconnected,30,I was expecting (and hoping for) a spooky and atmospheric thrill ride but instead got an ill conceived and unpolished first person puzzle game. The story is weak the puzzles unintuitive and the experience wholly unsatisfying. Explorers would be better served travelling back in time and playing Myst or picking up one of the games I mentioned above. Steer clear of this one.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,GameCube,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,1UP,30,As I painfully maneuvered my Charlie from room to room I grew more and more desperate in my attempt to find redeeming qualities in the game.
SuperPower,PC,Mar-28-2002,GolemLabs,Strategy | Turn-Based | Wargame | Turn-Based | General,Electric Playground,30,The games lack of focus poor design and beta-like release state will put it not in the forefront of strategy discussion boards but rather the back of discount software bins.
The Cursed Crusade,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Kylotonn,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameOver.gr,30,A game broken in so many ways even its budget price tag is not enough to save it from oblivion.
Ultimate Beach Soccer,Xbox,Nov-10-2003,Pam Development,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,One begins to wonder where the company found the nerve to release a game that plays as if it were coded by the ultimate beach personality Jeff Spiccoli. [Mar 2004 p.80]
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PlayStation 2,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,The Sydney Morning Herald,30,This official game of the Games however makes it about as exciting as lying in an empty bath and pretending its the luge or sticking your head in the freezer and singing Advance Australia Fair.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,Wii,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Game Almighty,28,It borrows so heavily from the format of Marvel Ultimate Alliance that you’ll likely be hard pressed to find anyone who won’t tell you to simply play that game instead. Considering all the bad movie games we’ve seen in the past year saying that this is one of the worst should really mean something.
Drive Girls,PlayStation Vita,Sep-8-2017,Tamsoft,Action | General,GamingTrend,40,Drive Girls is a hack and slash slog where you quite literally drive girls who transform into cars to fight evil bugs. It is every bit the stupid ridiculous freaky fun game that it sounds like and has some guilty pleasure elements that can endear it to players even while they recognize it is a total wreck. Battles are unique but ultimately boring and a bad story and lackluster look makes Drive Girls a mostly forgettable mess.
Air Raid: This Is Not a Drill!,PC,Jun-18-2003,Made by Kiddies,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic,Cheat Code Central,30,This is the style of arcade game that was around in mechanical form since the early 50s. Its just an on-rails shooter that never lets up. You never move from your position while shooting down swarms of Japanese aircraft with your AA gun. Its so easy to play its ridiculous.
Army Men: Green Rogue,PlayStation 2,Mar-25-2001,3DO,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy,Core Magazine,33,A game that can only generate slight indifference.
Turning Point: Fall of Liberty,PC,Feb-26-2008,Spark Unlimited,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Informer,30,With the number of average-to-outstanding FPS titles available on next-gen consoles there’s absolutely no reason to waste your time with this disaster. [Apr 2008 p.86]
25 to Life,PC,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,PC Gamer,30,A sentence of 25 to Life lasts only six to seven hours if played on medium difficulty. [Apr 2006 p.51]
Pocket Racers,PSP,Nov-14-2006,Konami | Blade Interactive,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,GamesRadar+,20,Online minigames and a decent selection of cars don’t save Pocket Racers from being one of the worst rubber-burners on Sony’s portable system.
Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,PlayStation 3,May-22-2012,Supermassive Games,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,NZGamer,30,Its frustrating. More so because the easy bits are so repetitive and simple while the tricky bits are random and insane.
Wacky Races: Crash & Dash,Wii,Jun-17-2008,Eidos Sweden,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Kart | Other | Kart,Cheat Code Central,30,While everything basically works as it should steering is still made difficult by a mixture of poor camera angles and claustrophobic tracks.
Troll and I,PlayStation 4,Mar-21-2017,Maximum Games,Action Adventure | General,TheSixthAxis,30,Slapping down poor video games never brings me much pleasure especially those that genuinely show promise. While it has a unique setting and some solid ideas boring level design and a general lack of imagination when piecing together all of these components leaves me with very little to praise.
Senran Kagura Reflexions,Switch,Sep-13-2018,Honey Parade Games,Action | Adventure | General,Digitally Downloaded,30,Senran Kagura Reflexions has actually done a lot of damage to the series.
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D,3DS,Oct-16-2012,n-Space,Strategy | Tycoon | Management | Tycoon | Business / Tycoon,XGN,30,Havent we all once loved RollerCoaster Tycoon? We too were all cheery and happy when we heard about a new 3DS version of the game. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D proved to be a bummer though not good at all. Say goodbye to your dreams.
Brain Boost: Beta Wave,DS,Nov-17-2006,Interchannel,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,VideoGamer,30,While Brain Training still clearly continues to rule the brain-boosting roost there is no reason why a few more decent mental agility games shouldnt come along to challenge its title.
The Polar Express,PlayStation 2,Nov-2-2004,Blue Tongue,Action Adventure | Fantasy,DarkStation,30,It has so many flaws combined with the short span of the game makes for one that would be near impossible to recommend.
Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,Xbox 360,Nov-20-2012,Heavy Iron Studios,Action | General | Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,Appalling levels terrible writing repetitive gags and weak shooting mechanics make for one of the least enjoyable experiences of 2012. Be smart and avoid at all costs. [Issue#93 p.82]
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Xbox,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Cheat Code Central,30,Atrocious. And not atrociously good fun either. Simply atrocious. Its like biting into an Oh Henry and discovering that it is indeed a big fat solid chunk of stanky human dung and undigested peanuts.
25 to Life,PlayStation 2,Jan-17-2006,Ritual Entertainment | Avalanche Software,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,IGN,30,The single player is boring arrestingly conventional and entirely forgettable. The multiplayer is slightly better though mostly because of its options and not because of its gameplay.
Hello Neighbor,Switch,Jul-27-2018,tinyBuild,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,Nintendo Insider,40,Hello Neighbor could be fun within the right parameters. The neighbour would hold a lot more terror if his actions carried any weight. The puzzling aspect of switches hidden doors and traps would be more enjoyable were they staged within an inspiring world or using interesting concepts. But the game fails on all of these points not holding attention not really projecting any fear beyond the first few encounters and the world feels as flat as the polygons used to build it.
Coffeetime Crosswords,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | General | Puzzle | Logic | General,Eurogamer,30,Insultingly simple and clumsy Live Arcade puzzle game unworthy of your time.
Ju-on: The Grudge,Wii,Oct-13-2009,FeelPlus,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,games(TM),30,Theres simply not enough material here to justify the asking price and the small amount on the disc is sub-par entertainment on almost every level. [Dec 2009 p.111]
Thor: God of Thunder,PlayStation 3,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,GamePro,30,Thor: God of Thunder looks terrible plays poorly and was obviously rushed out to market with no fine-tuning whatsoever. Considering that the DS version is so much better by comparison (along with the vastly superior free Flash title from Marvel Studios) Im saddened that this game had to ever exist.
R.I.P.D. The Game,Xbox 360,Jul-17-2013,Old School Games,Action | General | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,EGM,30,R.I.P.D.: The Game is really nothing more than a crappy movie tie-in game in the longstanding tradition of crappy movie tie-in games. There’s not much substance here and what you do get is so unpolished and unrewarding that it’s not worth your time.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,PC,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | Shooter | General | First-Person | Modern,GameSpot,30,Raven Squad is 90 percent first-person shooter 10 percent strategy game and 100 percent bad.
Monsters Inc. Scream Arena,GameCube,Sep-14-2002,Radical Entertainment,Action | Platformer | 3D,IGN,25,This is not a game for Disney fans kids or anyone. In fact its barely a game at all.
Anacapri: The Dream,PC,Sep-12-2007,S&G Software,Adventure | General | General,GameSpot,25,Anacapri has more in common with the ancient gameplay of early 90s adventures than anything modern but even as a pseudo-nostalgia piece its no fun at all.
Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,Xbox 360,Feb-10-2009,Tamsoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D | 3D,Video Game Talk,30,Just save your money and play something that is actually worth your time.
Tony Hawk's Motion,DS,Nov-18-2008,Creat Studios,Sports | Alternative | Individual | Skateboarding | Skateboarding | Skate / Skateboard,Gameplanet,30,A poorly produced game with little to offer any Tony Hawk fan.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,Wii,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software | Eurocom,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,GameSpot,35,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor has all the right elements yet it still manages to do everything wrong.
Cartoon Network Racing,PlayStation 2,Dec-4-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade,Game Chronicles,32,I was completely disappointed. It tries to be exactly like Mario Kart but it doesn’t even come close to that level of enjoyment. This genre does not need any more lame imitators. It needs innovators.
The Deer God,Switch,Dec-21-2017,Cinopt Studios LLC,Action | Platformer | 2D,Cubed3,30,The blurb for The Deer God promises to Challenge your religion and your platforming skills but it does neither. The platforming moments are ridiculously easy and the combat is easily abused. The worst of the game though is the story which constantly stresses a morality that makes no sense at all all culminating in an absolutely moronic ending. There are many fantastic indie titles that have made the jump to Nindies. This is not one of them.
Coffee Tycoon,PC,Sep-11-2006,Anarchy Enterprises,Strategy | Tycoon | Tycoon,Digital Entertainment News,20,If Coffee Tycoon were a beverage it would taste worse than cold coffee with a shot of urine in it. Try Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition for a much more pleasant beverage-tycoon gaming experience.
Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure,GameCube,Dec-18-2001,Kemco,Miscellaneous | Party,GameSpot,35,Too frustrating and convoluted for kids to have any fun with it and all but the most desperate adult GameCube fans will find it tedious and unentertaining as well.
Resident Evil: Survivor,PlayStation,Aug-30-2000,Capcom,Action Adventure | Horror,IGN,40,Itll provide you with about four hours maximum of campy brainless shooting kicks. Just dont blame me for feeling dirty afterward because you will oh yes you will.
Realms of Ancient War,PC,Oct-4-2012,Wizarbox,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Gamereactor Sweden,30,One step away from a total disaster. And that step - lots of enemies - isnt very interesting.
Inkheart,DS,Jan-12-2009,Dreamcatcher,Adventure | General | General,GameShark,25,The one saving grace that the game does has is that is references plenty of older classic novels that young kids may have never heard of.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5,Xbox One,Sep-29-2015,Robomodo,Sports | Individual | Skate / Skateboard,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,One of gamings greatest series bails horribly loses its high score and sinks to a depressing new low. Truly awful.
Turn It Around,DS,Aug-28-2007,Taito Corporation | 505 Games,Action | General | General,Deeko,35,Id like to recommend the game in some fashion but sadly it took longer to pen this piece than it did for me to get through the actual game with one notable exception - no wrist pain.
Pacific Rim,Xbox 360,Jul-12-2013,Yuke's,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Germany,30,Guillermo del Toro once said in an interview he made the film for himself and his children and it shows. The game on the other hand might just be the perfect instrument to penalize adolescent troublemakers.
Alone in the Dark,Wii,Jun-23-2008,Hydravision,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,N-Europe,30,Alone In The Dark is a truly shining example of both how to make a bad game and how to over-hype a game. Avoid.
Star Wars: Flight of the Falcon,Game Boy Advance,Nov-18-2003,Pocket Studios,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,GamePro,40,A neck-stabbingly frustrating bore. [Apr 2004 p.86]
Putty Squad,PlayStation 4,Mar-11-2014,System 3,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,Everyeye.it,30,Ugly is not enough to define Putty Squad. It is simply an (almost) unpublished game from 20 years ago with outdated graphics and gameplay.
Motocross Mania 3,Xbox,Apr-27-2005,Deibus Studios,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,BonusStage,37,Wiping your memory clean of Motocross Mania 3 is one of the best things you could do as it is a perfect example of how to not make a game correctly.
Burnout Legends,DS,Nov-29-2005,Visual Impact,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Arcade | Automobile,Modojo,20,Then we come to the control which is also shot up quite horrendously. The vehicular turning is pretty lofty at best where you have to maintain an incredible sense of steering. This combined with the so-called tactics for scoring takedowns on opponent vehicles just leads to remarkably bad frustration.
Dead or Alive Paradise,PSP,Mar-30-2010,Team Ninja | Tecmo,Action | General | General,Eurogamer Spain,30,Avoid at all costs. Playability is awful and even the girls arent that sexy: they are destroyed by low polygon count models and horrible textures.

[Issue#203]
Attack of the Movies 3D,Xbox 360,May-18-2010,Panic Button,Action | General | General,Gamervision,30,Attack of the Movies 3-D is one of the worst games I’ve played in a long time.
Painkiller: Resurrection,PC,Oct-27-2009,Homegrown Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Fantasy | Arcade,Multiplayer.it,30,Painkiller: Resurrection is a bugfest. It is technically outdated and the co-op mode is hidden between the menus. There is no way to make this multiplayer mode work well.
Umbrella Corps,PlayStation 4,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Edge Magazine,30,Theres little satisfaction in downing an enemy who cant see you less in getting flattened by an unseen assailant. [Issue#296 p.114]
G.I. Combat,PC,Nov-4-2002,Freedom Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Wargame | Real-Time | General,Gamers' Temple,29,The nonexistent tutorial clunky interface rough and bland graphics and quirky AI are all hallmarks of a game released too early... more an exercise in frustration and bewilderment than a game.

Pimp My Ride,Xbox 360,Dec-6-2006,Eutechnyx,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Some subjects will just never translate well into videogames--like anything related to proctology Paris Hilton or yes MTV shows. [Feb. 2007 p.79]
Godzilla Unleashed,PlayStation 2,Nov-20-2007,Pipeworks Software | Inc.,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,AceGamez,30,Godzilla Unleashed is a latter-generation PS2 title arriving just in time for Christmas - it doesnt play well it doesnt look good and it doesnt offer anything new.
DARK,Xbox 360,Jul-9-2013,Kalypso,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern | Linear,Edge Magazine,30,Realmforge is clearly a student of the genre but budget is king here and the studio lacks the financial clout to even pierce the flesh of a crowded market. Despite being crafted with noble intentions Dark succeeds only in sucking the life out of itself.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PC,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,PC Master (Greece),38,What’s frustrating is that Terminal Reality whether you believe it or not had laid the foundations for an extraordinary game. WD:SI includes all the activities that a decent zombie survival game should have. [May 2013]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,Xbox 360,Aug-28-2013,Red Fly Studio,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,XGN,30,How can such a bad game be part of the Summer of Arcade? Those games need to be special. This Turtles game is definitely not.
Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,Wii,Nov-12-2010,Eighting | Takara Tomy,Action | General | Fighting | General | 3D,GameFocus,34,Its not that Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles is completely broken its just that each and every aspect of it is so flawed that it results in an experience that is mediocre at best.
Vampire Rain,Xbox 360,Jul-3-2007,Artoon,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GamingTrend,30,Even a game with a bad story can be salvageable if the gameplay is fun. Unfortunately this isn’t the case.
Thor: God of Thunder,Xbox 360,May-3-2011,Liquid Entertainment,Action | General | General,Gaming Nexus,25,Thor: God of Thunder is what one would come to expect with other movie-licensed games. The cinematics are sub-par the combo system is quite repetitive and the difficulty is skewed. The only redeeming qualities I found were using the leveling system to actually refill your health and Odin Force and the effects of the elemental attacks looked cool but the fun factor is just not there.
Project Root,Xbox One,Apr-29-2015,Pablo Testa,Action | Shooter | Shoot-'Em-Up | Vertical,Pure Xbox,30,Theres scope here for a good game were a bit more work put in but the smart money says that youll be way more frustrated with Project Roots patently unfair gameplay than you are impressed by it.
Carnival Games: Mini-Golf,Wii,Oct-20-2008,Cat Daddy Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,Cheat Code Central,32,While the graphics and hole designs are inviting the frustrations caused by the controls and Barker himself successfully put a damper on the entire experience.
Raven Squad: Operation Hidden Dagger,Xbox 360,Aug-25-2009,Atomic Motion,Action | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Youd be a Raven lunatic to buy it. [Oct 2009 p.90]
Seven Kingdoms: Conquest,PC,Oct-15-2007,Enlight Software | Infinite Interactive,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | Historic | Command,IGN,30,This is an even worse game than Empire Earth 3 for the simple fact that the design shows promise but its utterly undermined by the horrible execution.
Kengo: Legend of the 9,Xbox 360,Sep-11-2007,Genki,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,GameSpot,30,Who knew that samurai swordfighting could ever be so dull and annoying?
The Simpsons Skateboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2002,The Code Monkeys,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,GameZone,30,If you’re looking for Tony Hawk Pro Skater for a much younger crowd or really love the show Simpsons Skateboarding will surely disappoint.
Blades of Time,Switch,May-14-2019,Gaijin Distribution,Action | General,Digitally Downloaded,20,Re-playing Blades of Time in 2019 is surreal. There are assuredly many better games from the previous generation of consoles that deserve to be on Switch ahead of this one. I can’t even imagine the developers have any hope of using this re-release to springboard the franchise back as they work on a sequel because no one is going to want a sequel after playing it. Time hasn’t been good to Blades of Time and and other than for the morbidly curious I can’t see anyone being masochistic enough to derive any value out of it.
Rock Revolution,Xbox 360,Oct-15-2008,Zoe Mode | HB Studios Multimedia,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music | Music,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,More revolting than it is a revolution. [May 2009 p.87]
Legend of the Dragon,PSP,May-29-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Game Chronicles,30,Legend of the Dragon is a disappointment for a fighting game. There is a general lack of anything that stands out to make it worth paying attention to or purchasing.
Heavy Fire: Red Shadow,PlayStation 4,Oct-16-2018,Mastiff,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Arcade,UploadVR,20,Heavy Fire: Red Shadow is short and for once in a linear game that’s a good thing because I wanted to move on with my life the second I had finished playing it. Casually prejudiced generic in nearly every way and an absolute bore to slog through it genuinely might be the worst game on PlayStation VR. If you’re given this as a gift cut out that person from your life even if they’re a blood relative. It isn’t worth it.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,PlayStation 2,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Electronic Gaming Monthly,30,T3s first-person shooting stages are plagued by poor controls terrible level designs brain-dead enemies and just plain ugly graphics. [Feb 2004 p.106]
SoulCalibur: Lost Swords,PlayStation 3,Apr-22-2014,Bandai Namco Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Eurogamer,30,To call Lost Swords a failed experiment would be an insult to every ambitious game that fell flat on its face. It feels like Namco put barely any thought into making the not-so-micro-transactions justifiable or even making sure that the single-player focus felt consistently engaging.
Dying: Reborn,PlayStation 4,Feb-28-2017,Nekcom,Adventure | 3D | First-Person,GameGrin,35,Dying: Reborn is an interesting enough puzzle game that falls short of making any kind of impact at all. A cash-in game for the VR age skipping this title would be recommended.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,PlayStation 3,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Gamereactor Denmark,30,Harry Potter turns into a wannabe third person shooter and the result is abysmal. Movie-based games get a bad rap and its because of titles like this one. We cant think of anything nice to say about it not even when playing it with Kinect. Its a bad game from end to end and has no redeeming qualities. Avoid at all cost even if (or maybe especially if) youre a Harry Potter-head.
Hello Neighbor,PC,Dec-8-2017,Dynamic Pixels,Action | Adventure | General | 3D | First-Person,CD-Action,35,The concept for the game is great level design is solid and the visuals are sometimes nice but the whole thing is painfully underdone. [02/2018 p.46]
Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal,PlayStation 2,Oct-9-2007,Red Tribe,Action Adventure | Fantasy,GameSpot,30,Dull repetitive and carelessly programmed dont even begin to sum up how crummy this action game based on the Looney Tunes license is.
ECW Anarchy Rulz,Dreamcast,Dec-30-2000,Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City,Action | Fighting | Wrestling,Hot Games,20,Its as tired and useless as many of the wrestlers represented and playing this is almost like watching a seniors match in wrestling -- old familiar faces doing the same old familiar moves that made them famous.
Left Behind: Eternal Forces,PC,Nov-7-2006,Left Behind Games,Strategy | Real-Time | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,Worth Playing,30,Avoid this title like the plague. Not only are you sparing yourself the discomfort of ham-fisted preaching and shoddy game mechanics you’ll also be doing your part to ensure that this obscene mess of eschatological flotsam and apocryphal jetsam never sees a sequel.
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,PlayStation 2,Jul-22-2008,Eurocom Entertainment Software,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Variety,20,Sierra couldnt have picked a more forgettable swan song than an adaptation of the latest iteration in the blandly epic Mummy franchise thats as dull to look at as it is to play.
Evolution Snowboarding,PlayStation 2,Nov-26-2002,Konami,Sports | Alternative | Snowboarding,PSM Magazine,30,Save for a few boss designs the graphics are dull while the arcade-styled controls are so simple as to almost reward a lack of skill. [Feb 2003 p.33]
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,Game Boy Advance,May-30-2002,David A. Palmer Productions,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Pocket Games,20,Overall wed prefer death to torture and perhaps both to an extended session playing this game. [Winter 2002 p.47]
The Ripping Friends,Game Boy Advance,Mar-24-2002,Creations,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,IGN,30,Without nearly enough sight gags or over-the-top style to actually put that humor in the game its kind of pointless.
Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor,Xbox 360,Jun-19-2012,From Software,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Destructoid,30,This motion never works consistently and the controller itself (which the game says you need to hold as both movement and firing are done from it) even blocks your hands from the sensor sometimes. This basically means that in the heat of battle youre putting your hands in front of you back and forth constantly just to see/shoot/move and go back to view your instruments.
Godzilla,PlayStation 4,Jul-14-2015,NATSUME ATARI Inc.,Action | General,NZGamer,30,Bumbling combat laughable visuals and terribly overpriced.
Bubble Bobble Revolution,DS,Oct-3-2006,Taito Corporation,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,GamingTrend,26,Unfortunately nostalgia rarely holds up they couldnt even implement the new systems features and instead of taking something old and reinventing it they made a broken version of a classic game with graphics that have no character.
Pure Futbol,Xbox 360,Jun-1-2010,Ubisoft Vancouver,Sports | Traditional | Team | Soccer | Sim | Arcade | Arcade,Metro GameCentral,30,FIFA Street meets Mario Strikers but even as an arcade game this falls well short of world class.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,Xbox 360,Nov-16-2010,EA Bright Light,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GamePro,30,It doesnt matter if youre a hardcore or casual fan: theres no magic to be seen here.
Far Cry Vengeance,Wii,Dec-12-2006,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameDaily,30,One of the Wiis worst games an underdeveloped mess that will turn off most of its players by the middle – or possibly even the beginning -- of level one. Ubisoft attempted some innovative control techniques but most of them feel awful-- even doing simple things like jumping and lobbing grenades sucks.
Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle,Switch,Oct-10-2017,CUBETYPE,Action | Fighting | 3D,God is a Geek,30,Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle is the worst Touhou game I’ve played and one that you should avoid unless you absolutely must own everything Touhou.
Randall,PlayStation 4,Jun-6-2017,We The Force,Action | Platformer | 2D,DarkStation,30,This is the freshman effort for developer We the Force Studios and it is certainly noticeable throughout the entirety of Randall. The Mexico based developer has crafted a game that obviously pays homage to a style of gameplay that they are fond of. However the end result is little more than just that: an homage without any of the hooks that make other games of this variety so great. There is certainly potential for a great game within Randall and I hope this fledgling developer is able to learn from its mistakes to craft a more cohesive game in its next attempt.
Tenchu: Dark Secret,DS,Aug-21-2006,From Software | Polygon Magic,Action Adventure | Historic | General | Historic,Official Nintendo Magazine UK,30,A botched excuse for a stealth game whose only achievement is bringing a decent series name into disrepute. This game should have been so much better. [Jan 2007 p.72]
Napoleon Dynamite: The Game,PSP,Oct-23-2007,7 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | General | General | Puzzle | Party / Minigame | General,1UP,30,The core problem with Napoleon Dynamite: The Game is that it totally disregards the humor of the film (and as such of the audience its attempting to reach). The whole joke of Napoleon Dynamite was that Jon Heders titular character constantly claims to have more skill than he actually possesses. In the game you have all that skill and more.
Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,PC,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports | Olympic Sports | Individual | Athletics,The Sydney Morning Herald,30,This official game of the Games however makes it about as exciting as lying in an empty bath and pretending its the luge or sticking your head in the freezer and singing Advance Australia Fair.
Pocket Pool,PSP,Apr-18-2007,Conspiracy Entertainment,Sports | Miscellaneous | Parlor | Individual | Billiards | Billiards,WHAM! Gaming,30,Pocket Pool largely fails as a billiards simulation and completely fails as a source of titillation. Go to the local pool hall and talk to some flesh and blood women instead.
Speed Zone,Wii,Aug-18-2009,Awesome Play Ltd.,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Futuristic | Futuristic,games(TM),30,Had the handling and collision detection been improved then Wheelspin might actually have been a good game. [Issue#91 p.114]
TMNT,PSP,Mar-20-2007,Ubisoft Montreal,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Pocket Gamer UK,30,A rushed production that regrettably yet predictably emerges as a substandard game of a substandard film.
Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am,PlayStation 2,Nov-5-2007,Creat Studios,Action | General,GameSpot,35,Just because a game seemingly aims to be bad on purpose doesnt make it any less of a bad game.
Shifters,PlayStation 2,Jun-17-2002,3DO,Action Adventure | Fantasy,Game Revolution,25,The game really doesnt offer anything interesting aside from the whole shape-shifting thing which is does poorly. With empty battles and bland side-quests the point of it all is lost.
Legend of the Dragon,Wii,May-1-2007,Neko Entertainment,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Kombo,30,Throughout its lifespan Legend of the Dragon fails to entertain for more than a few minutes.
Quantum Theory,Xbox 360,Sep-28-2010,Tecmo,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Awful - a crushing disappointment. [Oct 2010 p.102]
Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes,PlayStation,Sep-19-2000,n-Space,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi,Core Magazine,25,Realizing that you have just spent 40 hard earned dollars on a game that is barely more enjoyable than reading a cereal box really takes the cake in terms of excruciating actualization.
Fight Club,Xbox,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Xbox Nation Magazine,30,To be fair the backgrounds look pretty. [Jan 2005 p.90]
Agony,PlayStation 4,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Jeuxvideo.com,30,Agony clearly deserves its name. The gameplay mechanics are chaotic at best the AI is plain dumb the level-design is muddled the scenario is boring… Well there’s nothing to save here.
Crash Boom Bang!,DS,Oct-10-2006,Dimps Corporation,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Eurogamer,30,It could have been an interesting title but the problems with control weird gameplay style terrible graphics and rigged repetitive games just kill any joy that would be garnered from playing it.
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,Game Boy Advance,Nov-25-2002,Pocket Studios,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,All Game Guide,30,The biggest issue players will likely have is fighting off sheer boredom instead of a pack of orcs trolls or scorpions.
Hour of Victory,Xbox 360,Jun-25-2007,Nfusion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Informer,25,If the single-player campaign isn’t painful enough Hour of Victory offers a multiplayer component so poorly constructed that just trying to shoot another person makes you feel as stupid and incompetent as the game’s AI. At the very most Hour of Victory is deserving of Worst Game of the Year honors.
Blackwater,Xbox 360,Oct-25-2011,Zombie Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,IGN,25,This is a bad game from top to bottom and it doesnt deserve a moment of your attention.
NFL Blitz 20-02,Game Boy Advance,Sep-17-2001,OutLook Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Football | Arcade,GameSpot,26,One thing is fact: NFL Blitz 2002 for the GBA is a stinker.
Left Alive,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Square Enix | ilinx inc.,Action Adventure | General,Hardcore Gamer,30,With so many narrative technical and gameplay issues that pop up at almost every turn — all wound up within some of the worst third-person stealth mechanics imaginable — Left Alive is both a horridly-conceived experience and a fundamentally unenjoyable product to even attempt to immerse one’s self in.
Defender,Game Boy Advance,Nov-3-2002,OutLook Entertainment,Action | Shooter | Scrolling,All Game Guide,40,Defender proves that more is not necessarily better especially when it comes to modes of play. Rather than take a rock solid format and enhance it through multiple variants of the same basic theme the developers have created a mess and tried to cover it up with different versions that all have weaknesses.
Rocky and Bullwinkle,Xbox 360,Apr-16-2008,Zen Studios,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,Official Xbox Magazine UK,30,Zany but this price is just ridiculous. [June 2008 p.79]
Underworld Ascendant,PC,Nov-15-2018,OtherSide Entertainment,Role-Playing | General,IGN,30,Underworld Ascendant is a buggy repetitive and boring mess of an RPG.
Wonder World Amusement Park,Wii,Jul-8-2008,Coyote Console,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,IGN,31,Wonderworld Amusement Park has no personality; no soul. Theres nothing on offer here that other Wii mini-game collections havent already beaten to death. Whats worse many of these games are frustrating or have unresponsive controls.
Ready 2 Rumble Revolution,Wii,Mar-17-2009,10tacle Studios,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,Worth Playing,30,Basically Ready 2 Rumble Revolution for the Wii is nearly unplayable. I love the idea of having an arcade boxer on the Wii and while boxing on Wii Sports didnt exactly blow my socks off it worked out far better than this game did. Im not sure that complicated controls for an arcade boxer are the way to go on the Wii and Ready 2 Rumble proves that more punch types dont necessarily translate into a better boxing experience.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,Xbox,Jul-17-2002,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,TotalGames.net,30,It doesn’t seem to know whether it wants to be a realistic simulation of the sport or a straight-out arcade game as it stands it manages to succeed as neither.
Crystal Rift,PlayStation 4,Nov-29-2016,Psytec Games Ltd,Role-Playing | Western-Style,Digitally Downloaded,30,Crystal Rift possesses all the potential in the world and I certainly hope the game performs well enough that the development team is able to go back to the drawing board and come up with a more comprehensive and nuanced structure for another crack at the VR dungeon crawler.
Traitors Gate 2,PC,Nov-2-2003,258 Productions AB,Adventure | 3D | Modern | Third-Person,Just Adventure,25,Virtually unplayable.
Frogger 2,Xbox 360,Jun-11-2008,Voltex | Inc.,Action | General | General,Console Monster,28,It is playable but only just for a few minutes.
Escape from Bug Island,Wii,Jul-25-2007,Spike,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,GameSpot,35,Escape from Bug Island is a dismal reminder of the low points of survival horrors past.
Tamagotchi Party On!,Wii,May-29-2007,h.a.n.d. Inc.,Miscellaneous | Party | Party | Party / Minigame,GameZone,35,A boring party game that lacks the pace and originality of its genre counterparts Tamagotchi: Party On should be avoided at all costs.
3D Classics: Urban Champion,3DS,Aug-18-2011,Arika,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 2D | 2D,IGN,25,Skip over 3D Classics: Urban Champion. Urban Champion is not a classic it never was and 3D is entirely wasted on it.
Lucha Fury,Xbox 360,Jun-22-2011,Punchers Impact,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,Gameblog.fr,20,Very inspired by the Lucha Libre comic Lucha Fury offers a really polished artistic direction colorful visuals and a fun mexican wrestling take on the atmosphere. But once you get your hands on the controller it feels like youve been suplexed hard : the gameplay clearly lacks smoothness the characters feel like theyre ice skating all the time collision bugs are legion and theres latency in the execution of the combat moves... The special moves seem dull and there arent any enemy really fun to battle. Levels are repetitive poorly paced musics can make you crazy... its the typical example of a beatem all with a world and atmosphere that would have been perfect for the genre if only the gameplay wasnt a real mess.
Fluster Cluck,PlayStation 4,Oct-21-2014,LOOT Entertainment,Action | General,ZTGD,25,If I was to walk up to someone and ask Have you played Fluster Cluck? I’d probably get the strange eye which pretty much sums up my thoughts on the game as a whole.
Combat Medic: Special Operations,PC,Apr-30-2002,Legacy Interactive,Action Adventure | Modern | General | Modern,PC Gamer,21,Chances are youll have more fun reading a medical textbook. [August 2002 p.69]
Past Cure,PlayStation 4,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,A joyless chore. [Apr 2018 p.84]
Dead Space Ignition,PlayStation 3,Oct-12-2010,Sumo Digital,Puzzle | Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Puzzle | Shooter | Third-Person | Action | General | Sci-Fi,Eurogamer,30,The idea of an interactive comic as narrative expansion is a sound one but Ignition entirely fails to do the concept justice.
Pimp My Ride,PlayStation 2,Nov-21-2006,Eutechnyx,Strategy | General,PSM3 Magazine UK,31,Curiously the real stars of the show - the blokes at West Coast Customs - arent here. Instead you drive around the fictional city in unresponsive cars. [May 2007 p.78]
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,PlayStation 3,Feb-19-2008,Activision,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Playstation Official Magazine UK,30,The game taught us that Japan lost the war thanks to shattered AI and terrible clipping. [May 2008 p.111]
Sniper: Art of Victory,PC,Oct-16-2008,City Interactive,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,AceGamez,30,This leads me onto the AI of which Im not sure there actually is any.
Torino 2006 - the Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games,Xbox,Jan-24-2006,49Games,Sports | Olympic Sports,1UP,20,Its being sold now for $20. In a week when they are selling it for $4.99 it will still be overpriced.
Darkstar: The Interactive Movie,PC,Nov-8-2010,Parallax Software,Action | Adventure | Interactive Movie | General | Interactive Movie,games(TM),10,Its not a game. [Issue#118 p.106]
Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn,PlayStation 4,Jun-5-2018,Big Deez Productions,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | 2D,DarkStation,30,I can’t recommend Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn - it’s a joke that fizzles out quickly and leaves a sour taste in your mouth.
The Sum of All Fears,GameCube,Jan-9-2003,Ubisoft Shanghai,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Modern,GameSpot,26,Terrible. This first-person shooter from Red Storm Entertainment suffers from graphical problems poor control and terrible AI and on top of all that it can be beaten in less than two hours your first time through.
Kung Fu Rider,PlayStation 3,Sep-7-2010,SCE Japan Studio,Action | General | General,Gamer.no,30,Pure garbage is one way to put it but it would be strict. This ridiculous racer has its moments deeply hidden in between terrible controls that will make you test if the Move controllers can destroy a TV.
NBA Live 14,Xbox One,Nov-19-2013,EA Sports,Arcade | Sports | Traditional | Team | Basketball | Arcade,NZGamer,40,Its disappointing and hard to fathom that given how much was riding on the game EA could have dropped the ball so completely.
Coffin Dodgers,PlayStation 4,May-3-2016,Milky Tea Studios,Racing | Arcade | Automobile,Brash Games,30,Overall this game is not good. Do not waste your time or your money. If Milky Tea want to make another racing game they have a lot to work on before they will interest me again. It is up to you whether you let it tarnish your PS4 but in my case I have already deleted the game off of my game library.
X-Men: Destiny,Wii,Sep-27-2011,Silicon Knights,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | 3D,GameSpot,30,In X-Men: Destiny awful combat and meaningless choices combine to create a new mutation of boredom.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General,GameSpot,26,Every aspect of the game is categorically bad; the story is tough to follow the graphics are lousy and the gameplay is so contrived and repetitive that its unlikely anyone will garner much enjoyment from the game no matter how low their standards are for being entertained.
Damnation,Xbox 360,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Totally360,30,Overall Damnation is a complete mess. With the amount of quality titles that have been released so far this year it would be time well spent if you spent it elsewhere.
The Shield: The Game,PlayStation 2,Jan-9-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,GameSpy,30,This is one game that should have never been let out of a holding cell.
Orion: Dino Horde,PC,May-4-2012,Spiral Game Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Arcade,IGN,20,Apart from the bugs the game is just so utterly unappealing aesthetically and from a gameplay perspective that it feels almost like a tech demo (of tech from 1999) rather than an honest-to-goodness release title. Please dont waste your hard-earned dough on this mutt.
Dream Chronicles,Xbox 360,Oct-20-2010,PlayFirst,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Puzzle | Hidden Object | General | Puzzle | General,Eurogamer,20,But the really depressing thing about PlayFirsts spirit-crushing little game is that itll probably sell enough to result in a deluge of the bloody things and force us to question the sanity of mankind. Again.
Power Gig: Rise of the SixString,PlayStation 3,Oct-19-2010,Seven45 Studios,Action | Miscellaneous | Rhythm | Music Maker | Music Maker | Music,GamesRadar+,30,We have a game that tries its best but still feels a half-decade behind we have a guitar that isnt and we have a drum kit so flawed its almost offensive. Add it all together and take the average and it comes out to a nice even 3.
Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II,PSP,Apr-14-2009,Cowboy Rodeo,Simulation | Flight | WWII | WWII | Combat,IGN,20,The biggest problem is just that none of what Air Conflicts offers is fun.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,Xbox,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,VGPub,25,This game insulted my intelligence as a gamer and a human being. I found very little entertainment while playing this game and feel ripped off that I spent five bucks on it.
Disney Sports Skateboarding,GameCube,Nov-17-2002,KCEO,Sports | Alternative | Skateboarding,IGN,30,Ladies and gentlemen this game sucks... a real stinking pile.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack,DS,Nov-10-2009,Ubisoft,Action | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up,1UP,25,The only real change-up in the whole game is when the Turtles get shiny cybernetic-looking gear when they travel into the future. Its literally wave after wave of enemies through eight stages that serve as mere backdrops. And that wasnt really what was worth remembering from the old days.
Hollow,Switch,Feb-22-2018,MMEU,Action Adventure | Survival,NintendoWorldReport,30,Hollow as a game is an effective horror experience plagued by some poor goal communication with the player. It has clear issues but at its core Hollow is a technically impressive game built on generally good gameplay. As a port to Switch this game is unfortunately an abysmal mess.
Legends of Pegasus,PC,Aug-10-2012,Kalypso | Novacore Studios,Simulation | Strategy | Turn-Based | General | General | 4X,PC PowerPlay,30,An impenetrable mess with almost nothing to recommend it. Cast this one into the void. [Oct 2012 p.73]

Damnation,PlayStation 3,May-26-2009,Blue Omega,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Game Informer,30,This isn’t a premier blend of pulp fiction. It’s just a pulpy mess.
Alekhine's Gun,PlayStation 4,Mar-1-2016,Maximum Games | Bigmoon Studios,Action Adventure | General,Push Square,20,This title is one of a very rare breed one that will appeal to absolutely no one and buying it would quite literally be akin to throwing your money away.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,GameCube,Feb-27-2002,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameShark,30,This time around were presented with the same flat panel crowds barren brown landscapes and under-animated riders that weve all seen and played before. Heck even the character select screen looks boring.
Torrente,PC,Dec-6-2004,Cinemaware,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,Game Chronicles,30,The graphics are bland the sound is grating and the gameplay is about as much fun as watching paint dry. There are better things you could do with twenty dollars.
Umbrella Corps,PC,Jun-21-2016,Capcom,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical,Areajugones,30,Umbrella Corps is the most expensive free-to-play that you will find in the market. Not only is its gameplay terrible but its online mode does not feature anybody to play with so the game is almost dead by now. Capcom made us cry.
Risen 3: Titan Lords,PlayStation 3,Aug-12-2014,Piranha Bytes,Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,TheSixthAxis,30,Though Risen 3 has its moments there is simply too much to overlook even if you’re patient enough to make it five or six hours into the game. Role-playing die hards may be able to wring a few morsels of enjoyment from Titan Lords though others including casual fans of the genres will find it almost unplayable.
Double D Dodgeball,Xbox 360,Jul-16-2008,Yuke's,Action | Sports | General | General | Team | Other,MS Xbox World,30,With the hefty $10.00 price tag for Double D Dodgeball all gamers alike should dodge this title (no pun intended).
Arc of Alchemist,Switch,Jan-30-2020,Compile Heart,Role-Playing | Action RPG,RPG Site,20,Poor performance is bad enough but let me put it as simply as possible - the port in this state should not have been allowed to release. Its an embarrassment and Idea Factory clearly knew what a stinker the game was with the haphazard axing of the games originally planned English dub and NA physical releases. Arc of Alchemist is the worst game that I have ever reviewed and I sincerely hope that Idea Factory takes the time to really consider how this game came out the way that it did. I know they can do better than this.
Fight Club,PlayStation 2,Nov-16-2004,Genuine Games,Action | Fighting | 3D,Pelit (Finland),30,The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. [Jan. 05]
Eternity: The Last Unicorn,PlayStation 4,Mar-5-2019,Void Studios,Role-Playing | Action RPG,TheSixthAxis,20,If it means having to play Eternity to save them youre better off letting that last Unicorn go extinct.
Tokyo Tattoo Girls,PlayStation Vita,Nov-14-2017,SUSHI TYPHOON GAMES,Action | General,DarkStation,20,In the end what we have in Tokyo Tattoo Girls is by far one of the most shallow strategy games Ive ever seen with absolutely a joke of a story and shallow and repetitive gameplay. Its just so utterly disappointing in just about every aspect. As someone who doesnt have any tattoos (although my wife more than makes up for me) I think Id rather go get my first one than play this game any more than I had to.
One Piece: Grand Cruise,PlayStation 4,May-22-2018,Bandai Namco Games,Action | General,SpazioGames,30,One Piece: Grand Cruise is an awful experience that lacks both in content and quality.
Infernal: Hell's Vengeance,Xbox 360,Jun-30-2009,Metropolis Software,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Fantasy | Fantasy | Arcade,GameCritics,30,Something like Infernal: Hells Vengeance might have gained a minor following during the last generation (and thats a big might have) but it simply doesnt have any place in todays environment. Its technically weak and showcases no forward-thinking in terms of design and the conceptual side is just as stale.
Tsunami 2265,PC,Aug-4-2002,Prograph,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Armchair Empire,30,It has a great idea in terms of graphical presentation and plotline but it throws it all away through poor gameplay design.
Jackass the Game,DS,Jan-8-2008,Sensory Sweep,Action | General | General,Pocket Gamer UK,30,Over-ambitious 3D free-roaming stunt-a-thon which ends up being just hard to control repetitive and completely unsuited to DS.
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,GameCube,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Gamer's Hell,29,It isn’t the worst game ever made but that just means that it fails to achieve distinction even by its badness.
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,Xbox,Nov-11-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,DailyGame,30,I can sum it up with one word: sloppy.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,PlayStation 2,Jul-11-2005,High Voltage Software | Backbone Entertainment,Action Adventure | Modern,Gamestyle,30,The game play is too repetitive and a combination of poor controls and poor visuals make it frustrating to complete the levels. Its hard to imagine many people whatever their ages having the supreme patience to actually sit through more than a few hours of this game.
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,DS,Jun-15-2007,7 Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendo Power,20,If you need a comic-book movie-license game fix look elsewhere. I beg you. [Aug 2007 p.83]
Dead Space Ignition,Xbox 360,Oct-13-2010,Sumo Digital,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | Shooter | Puzzle | Puzzle | Third-Person | Action | Sci-Fi,Digital Chumps,30,Adding insult to injury is the success Dead Rising 2: Case Zero a $5 fully produced prequel to Dead Rising 2. The bar was raised and Ignition has no business occupying the same space.
7 Days to Die,Xbox One,Jun-28-2016,Iron Galaxy Studios | The Fun Pimps,Action | Action Adventure | Shooter | Survival | Sandbox | First-Person | Arcade,High-Def Digest,30,I am struggling to understand why people would choose this over some of the really excellent survival games out there. Maybe on PC it’s really great. On the Xbox One it is not.
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World,PlayStation 2,Nov-15-2001,Acclaim,Driving | Racing | Motorcycle | Motocross,GameSpot,24,A miserable failure...Gamers are advised to avoid this game period.
George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret,Wii,Mar-18-2008,Crave,Action | Platformer | Platformer | 2D | 2D,IGN,29,Its not funny and its not fun to play. If the developers had simply fine tuned the collision detection it probably would have been fine.
The Golden Compass,Wii,Dec-4-2007,Shiny Entertainment,Action Adventure | Fantasy | General | Fantasy,Game Informer,33,It pains me to say this but turn off your TV and just read the book or head to your local theater. This is a story everyone must experience just don’t try interacting with it.
Enemy Front,Xbox 360,Jun-10-2014,CI Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Tactical | Historic | Historic,Eurogamer,20,Enemy Front is a bad game on almost every level but it gives me no pleasure to report that. Its not a lazy game as you can see the developer trying as hard as it can to mimic the juggernauts that dominate the genre but nor does it show enough personality or ambition to break out of the tired old paradigms.
Showtime Championship Boxing,Wii,Dec-13-2007,Nikitova Games,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Boxing | Boxing | Combat | Boxing / Martial Arts,GamesRadar+,20,Showtime Championship Boxing would be a lousy looker two console generations ago; in 2008 it’s nothing short of a Mike Tyson-biting-ears-level embarrassment...Every aspect of Showtime Championship Boxing is baffling.
Street Jam Basketball,Game Boy Advance,Apr-25-2004,Prograph,Sports | Traditional | Basketball | Arcade,Pocket Games,30,Single-player mode has you spending more time trying to avoid getting hit than aiming for the hoop which gets annoying real quick. [Fall 2003 p.54]
Bad Boys: Miami Takedown,Xbox,Sep-14-2004,Blitz Games,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern,Warcry,25,A truly incomprehensible final product. This game although given the title Bad Boys and perhaps living up to the vulgarity and profanity of the movies does nothing to quell the hunger for explosion action wit or anything that the movies may have given me in an equal amount of time. What a waste.
NCIS,Xbox 360,Nov-1-2011,Ubisoft,Adventure | General | General,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Youre left with awkward stilted voice-acting serviceable graphics and rote button-pushing that feel less like a game experience and more like channel-surfing on your couch. Skip.
Drug Wars (2009),PC,Mar-17-2009,Paleo Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi,LEVEL (Czech Republic),30,CryEngine does not guarantee any fun. Interesting action game at first sight but then shows emptiness and boredom quite soon. All levels weapons and enemy designs are so wearisome that you will find it quite refreshing to read your spam folder instead. [July 2009]
The History Channel: Battle for the Pacific,Xbox 360,Dec-4-2007,Cauldron Ltd.,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Game Revolution,25,Ultimately though the biggest blow against the game is its brevity. You shouldnt have trouble clearing its single-player mode in two or three hours.
Girl Fight,PlayStation 3,Sep-24-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,NZGamer,30,Overall Girl Fight feels like a cheap less fluid (motion-wise) knock off of Dead or Alive. The arcade mode demands you play through at least seven times which wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing if this were a better game.
Valhalla Knights: Eldar Saga,Wii,Sep-30-2009,K2 | Kurogane,Role-Playing | General | General | Action RPG,GameSpot,25,As Valhalla Knights moves to the Wii any potential for fun is buried under tons of repetitive busywork and technical gaffs.
Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls,PC,Mar-6-2018,RLR Training Inc,Adventure | Visual Novel,Destructoid,20,Super Seducer: How to Talk to Women is too stupid to be sexist. It’s a relic from the Entourage era we’re all better off having moved on from and absolutely nothing to get worked up over.
Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror,PlayStation 2,Nov-18-2003,Black Ops Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,PSM Magazine,30,It just isnt any good. With so many gameplay problems lack of challenges and an absolute treaure trove of better FPS titles out there for PS2 theres no reason to give this one a second thought. [Jan 2004 p.46]
Star Raiders,Xbox 360,May-11-2011,Incinerator Games,Action | Simulation | General | Sci-Fi | Space | Small Spaceship | Small Spaceship | Combat,GameSpot,30,Star Raiders achieves the incredible somehow taking all the fun out of being a hotshot space pilot.
King of Clubs,Wii,Aug-4-2008,Oxygen Interactive,Sports | Traditional | Individual | Golf | Arcade | Arcade,GameZone,30,It’s simple really. King of Clubs just isn’t any fun to play and in an industry obsessed with making money at the consumers’ expense and developing safe-bet hit software developers would do well to take note: video games should be fun.
Langrisser Re:Incarnation -TENSEI-,3DS,Apr-19-2016,NCS | extreme Co. |Ltd.,Strategy | Turn-Based | Tactics,Cubed3,30,Langrisser Re:Incarnation -Tensei- seems decent based on pictures or perhaps a short on paper explanation but it quickly becomes apparent how rushed development must have been.
ShellShock 2: Blood Trails,PlayStation 3,Feb-24-2009,Rebellion,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Third-Person | Historic | Historic | Historic | Arcade,Thunderbolt,20,Avoid like you would a vicious infection.
Fireburst,Xbox 360,Jun-14-2013,exDream,Driving | Racing | Simulation | Rally / Offroad | Rally / Offroad | Automobile,Official Xbox Magazine,15,But the biggest bug of all came when Fireburst simply stopped working and hard-froze our console any time we tried loading an event. Deleting and downloading the game anew didn’t help; we had to start over using another gamertag. Were we not reviewing this horrendous bug-ridden racer we would’ve taken that as a welcome sign to burn it from our memories and never look back.
Rambo: The Video Game,PC,Feb-21-2014,Teyon,Action | General,PC Games,27,Rambo: The Video Game is indeed Your worst nightmare. This on-rails shooting gallery looks and plays like a game made by two monkeys. And it doesn’t even turn blue...
Jekyll & Hyde (2001),PC,Oct-9-2001,In Utero,Action | General | General,Computer Gaming World,20,This game is so full of bad ideas that make a mockery of good reading material. [Feb 2002 p.101]
The Expendables 2 Videogame,PlayStation 3,Jul-31-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,GamesRadar+,20,Between the cut down roster of famous faces from the movies cast frustrating control mechanics and noticeable lack of polish the movie tie-in gives few reasons to invest your time and money in a download.
David Beckham Soccer,Game Boy Advance,Oct-7-2002,Yoyo Entertainment,Sports | Traditional | Soccer | Arcade,IGN,22,A failure on every level.
Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops,PC,Apr-5-2011,Black Lion Studios,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Tactical | Modern | Modern,PC Games (Russia),25,Shadow Harvest will only bring pain and suffering into your life. Avoid it at all costs. [June 2011 p. 102]
Takedown: Red Sabre,PC,Sep-20-2013,Serellan LLC,Action | Shooter | General | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical,Riot Pixels,20,If you burn $15 and scatter the ashes you will have more fun than you would by playing this game.
Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon,Xbox 360,Dec-1-2008,Sandblast,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | General,X-ONE Magazine UK,30,For those who can look past the game’s flaws there are a few hours of mindless destruction and anal-probing to be had here but only if you’ve exhausted every other game out there.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,PlayStation 3,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,Push Square,30,The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is an appalling unpolished mess. Gameplay is dull and buggy there’s very little attempt at a plot the characters are unlikeable and bar a couple of interesting mechanics everything feels rushed and dated. The likenesses and voices are accurate with Norman Reedus and Michael Rooker reprising their roles as Daryl and Merle respectively but that isn’t enough to rescue this abomination from the shallow grave of wretchedness that it has dug for itself.
Past Cure,Xbox One,Feb-23-2018,Phantom 8,Action | General,4Players.de,20,If the goal was to demonstrate what can go wrong in terms of game design presentation and visual quality: Congratulations you passed with flying colors! Nothing in this game is appealing or entertaining.
March of the Penguins,DS,Nov-27-2006,Skyworks Technologies | SkyRiver Studios,Action | General | General,Nintendo Gamer,11,A horrendous mess of a game horrible to play in every way short of severing your hands at the wrists and squirting lemon on the stumps. [Mar 2007 p.70]
Agony,Xbox One,May-29-2018,Madmind Studio,Action Adventure | General | Survival,Jeuxvideo.com,30,Agony clearly deserves its name. The gameplay mechanics are chaotic at best the AI is plain dumb the level-design is muddled the scenario is boring… Well there’s nothing to save here.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition,Wii,Jun-14-2011,Behaviour Interactive,Action | General | General,GamePro,30,Not being able to transform in a Transformers game is ridiculous.
You Are Empty,PC,Jun-1-2007,Digital Spray Studios | Mandel ArtPlains,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Historic | Arcade,PC Gamer,35,Be warned...You Are Empty isnt so much a title as a disclaimer. [Mar 2008 p.74]
Astro Boy: The Video Game,DS,Oct-20-2009,Art,Action | General | Platformer | 2D,Edge Magazine,30,Partial blame can be laid on the less-than-stellar CG film Astro Boy adapts but considering High Voltage so vocally invoked Omega Factor during development it is not unfair to hold the game to a higher standard. It doesnt come close. [Jan 2010 p.96]
Bomberman: Act Zero,Xbox 360,Aug-29-2006,Hudson,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Action | General | Puzzle | Action,Detroit Free Press,25,While the Internet play is the frenzied chaotic fun youve come to expect from a Bomberman title (though it has some loading issues) youre completely unable to blow up buddies sitting on the couch next to you.
Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy,Switch,Jan-25-2018,Arc System Works,Role-Playing | Action RPG,Digitally Downloaded,20,Its never fun to play a game thats so fundamentally uninteresting that you really struggle to even watch the screen as youre playing.
The Shield: The Game,PC,Jan-22-2007,Point of View,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Third-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,IGN,21,One of the most boring generic games out there even with a strong character like Vic Mackey. Theres really nothing about the gameplay visuals sound or story that can justify a purchase.
Girl Fight,Xbox 360,Sep-25-2013,MicroProse | Kung Fu Factory,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Eurogamer Italy,30,Girl Fight is simply one of the worst fighting games out there. In a world where you can buy Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown with just a few euros nobody should ever think about downloading this crappy clone of Tecmos Dead or Alive.
McFarlane's Evil Prophecy,PlayStation 2,Jun-15-2004,Konami,Action | General,GamingWorld X,20,The game is a total disaster with no redeeming qualities. Konami has taken an interesting license and thrown away all potential.
Chicago Enforcer,Xbox,Feb-23-2005,Touchdown Entertainment,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Historic,Xbox Evolved,23,A terrible game. If for some reason you actually decide to go and pay $20 for this very poor excuse of a first person shooter then expect to find: a weak and very uninteresting story the absolute worst gameplay ever on the Xbox repetitive textures and bland colors and a very poor sound scheme.
Shrek: Super Party,Xbox,Nov-29-2002,Mass Media,Miscellaneous | Party,IGN,30,Do not pass go head directly to jail. Its bad. Boring. And also bad.
AMY,PlayStation 3,Jan-17-2012,Lexis Numerique,Action Adventure | Horror | Horror | Survival,PSFocus,25,Amy makes us understand parents who hit their children and that statement on itself is scarier than the hours we wasted playing this piece of crap.
Kick-Ass,PlayStation 3,Apr-29-2010,Frozen Codebase,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Metro GameCentral,20,The only asses that need kicking in this game are those of the developer responsible for such rubbish.
Superman Returns,DS,Nov-20-2006,EA Tiburon,Action | Action Adventure | Beat-'Em-Up | Beat-'Em-Up | Open-World | 2D,Nintendo Gamer,20,The mini missions are klunky beyond belief with extremely shoddy animation and they almost always have to be completed in a stupidly short length of time for enjoyment - and thats it. Ideal for morons with low expectations. [Feb 2007 p.82]
The Incredible Hulk,PC,Jun-10-2008,Edge of Reality,Action | General | General,PTGamers,25,The Incredible Hulk: The Official Videogame is simply one of the worst super-hero tie-ins of all time.
Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing,PlayStation 2,Jun-23-2002,Codemasters,Sports | Traditional | Boxing,IGN,26,An all around mess of a game Mike Tyson Heavyweight Boxing is officially one of (if not THE) worst examples of digital boxing weve ever seen.
Farming Simulator,Xbox 360,Nov-19-2013,Giants Software,Simulation | General | General | Virtual | Career,games(TM),30,Overall Farming Simulator does not feel like a simulator – if the point of the game is to offer a realistic experience of what it’s like to run a farm the game fails: people never fatigue (your staff will work straight through the 24-clock if left unattended) livestock produce is harvested by AI automatically and there’s a few game-breaking exploits that completely undermine the game.
X Rebirth,PC,Nov-15-2013,Egosoft,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Space | Large Spaceship | Large Spaceship | Civilian,NZGamer,28,Patches may stop the glitches but I think this space sim is far beyond repair.
Dawn of Fear,PlayStation 4,Feb-3-2020,Brok3nsite,Action Adventure | Survival,BaziCenter,25,Nostalgia always works right? All the drama and all the emotions hit the right spot in the brain and suddenly you are in love with something. Dawn of Fear is here to prove this theory wrong. It seem that the only thing the developers worked on was the nostalgia aspect and nothing else. Quite simply stay away from this game.
Van Helsing,Game Boy Advance,May-6-2004,Saffire,Action | General,Worth Playing,25,It’s obviously slapped together for a quick buck but it isn’t worth yours. With poor gameplay and underpar production values you won’t be seeing this title praised by anyone.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Spirit Detective,Game Boy Advance,Dec-2-2003,Sensory Sweep,Action Adventure | Sci-Fi,Electronic Gaming Monthly,22,Its pure boredom harnessed in cartridge form. [Feb 2004 p.128]
Demonworld: Dark Armies,PC,Jan-13-2002,Ikarion,Strategy | Real-Time | Historic | General | Historic,PC Gamer,17,What really condemns Demonworld though are its atrocious graphics and horrific AI and pathfinding. [Apr 2002 p.73]
Dragon Booster,DS,Dec-7-2005,Konami Computer Entertainment Hawaii,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Rail | Rail,GameSpot,29,Dragon Booster is a halfhearted and practically unplayable racing game with no redeeming qualities.
Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified,PlayStation Vita,Nov-13-2012,Nihilistic,Shooter | Modern | Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Arcade,InsideGamer.nl,20,The single player campaign of Declassified is barely worth mentioning; within one hour youve seen it all. The multiplayer doesnt keep you interested for much longer. Its light on maps and modes but more importantly it misses action. Black Ops Declassified makes us miss the time of the UMD when a sub-par game could at least be used as a fancy coaster.
Mistmare,PC,Jun-30-2003,Arxel Tribe,Role-Playing | Action RPG | Action RPG,GameSpot,17,More punishment than game. No matter what the box says this isnt so much a fantasy role-playing game as it is a medieval torture device right up there with the rack and the iron maiden.
Mortal Kombat Advance,Game Boy Advance,Dec-12-2001,Virtucraft,Action | Fighting | 2D,Nintendophiles,15,It doesnt help that the AI is ludicrously tough and as cheap as possible. The AI can pull off moves that the gamer couldnt possibly do as fast.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire,PlayStation 3,Nov-13-2006,Bec,Simulation | Sci-Fi | Vehicle | Mech | Mech | Combat,Cheat Code Central,26,Avoid this title like a 12th century leper. It’s easily the worst game of the launch the worst giant robot game ever and front runner for worst anime-inspired game in history.
Megamind: Ultimate Showdown,Xbox 360,Nov-2-2010,THQ Australia | THQ Studio Australia,Action | Adventure | General | General | General,GameWatcher,20,The epitome of a terrible movie tie-in game.
Target: Terror,Wii,Apr-22-2008,Leviathan Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | Light Gun | Light Gun,NTSC-uk,20,Only pick this up if youre the sort of person who buys supermarket own-brand bog roll and enjoys the rough sawdust texture.
Iron Man,PC,May-6-2008,Artificial Mind and Movement,Action | General | General,PC Zone UK,27,Combat though is miserable. [Aug 2008 p.73]
Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon,Xbox,Jul-1-2002,Ronin Entertainment,Action | Beat-'Em-Up,Xbox Nation Magazine,20,The twin albatrosses of slowdown and mediocre graphics loom large over Dragon and shoddy programming allows for honest-to-dreadfulness crashes. [Fall 2002 p.118]
Rekoil,PC,Jan-28-2014,Plastic Piranha,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Modern | Arcade,GameSpot,30,Rekoil suffers from game-breaking glitches that range from aggravating to completely bewildering.
Zombeer,PC,Jan-30-2015,Moonbite Games,Action | General,Multiplayer.it,20,Zombeer is an utter disaster plain & simple. Dont buy it even if you are the best zombie fan out there.
Women's Volleyball Championship,PlayStation 2,Jul-29-2008,Spike,Sports | Traditional | Volleyball,ZTGD,20,It is a great thing to bring light to an under promoted sport such as womens volleyball but in this case its like Ronald McDonald promoting P.E.T.A. It doesnt really help. So whatever you do DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch,PlayStation 2,Oct-14-2003,Big Ape Productions,Action | Fighting | 3D,GameSpot,28,Celebrity Deathmatchs biggest problem isnt its timing but rather its the absolutely horrid gameplay and complete lack of any worthwhile features.
Weeping Doll,PlayStation 4,Oct-27-2016,TianShe Media,Adventure | General,Digital Chumps,20,Weeping Doll is a brief presentation of experiments that do not work in virtual reality. Its theme is neither frightening nor coherent its puzzles are mundane and straightforward player movement is disorienting and inelegant and its visual aesthetic imitates the vision of a person with a dangerous blood alcohol concentration. Weeping Doll blunders its format worse than Digital Pictures full-motion video projects miscalculated the Sega CD.
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green,Xbox,Oct-26-2005,Brainbox Games,Action | Shooter | First-Person | Modern,GameSpot,19,Land of the Dead fails to deliver even the most garden-variety of zombie-killing thrills due to its inept combat awful visuals and cripplingly stupid artificial intelligence.
Escape Dead Island,Xbox 360,Nov-18-2014,Fatshark AB,Action Adventure | Adventure | 3D | Survival | Third-Person | Modern,X-ONE Magazine UK,20,A poor entry into a solid series that doesnt try to improve the experience or come up with any new ideas. Stick with the past and wait for the future. [Issue#119 p.85]
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric,Wii U,Nov-11-2014,Big Red Button Entertainment,General | Action | Platformer | 3D,NintendoWorldReport,20,I might even consider it the worst Sonic game I have ever played.
Gene Rain,Xbox One,Jul-31-2018,Deeli network,Action | Shooter | Third-Person | Arcade,XBLA Fans,20,If Gene Rain ever goes on sale for $5 and you’re desperate for some achievements then by by all means pick it for the points. Otherwise there is no redeeming value in paying anything for the game. There are no strong aspects. Literally nothing is done well. I wish I could say despite all the negatives but I can’t. Gene Rain is just awful and you should save your time and money.
Giana Sisters: Dream Runners,Xbox One,Aug-19-2015,Black Forest Games,Action | Platformer | 2D,We Got This Covered,30,Giana Sisters: Dream Runners is far too fast frenetic and convoluted for its own good. Run away from this one before it entices you to spend any money.
Best of Tests DS,DS,Mar-4-2008,Otaboo,Miscellaneous | Edutainment | Edutainment,Gamers' Temple,20,The real test of intelligence here is whether or not you are smart enough to avoid this game.
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct,Xbox 360,Mar-19-2013,Terminal Reality,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Sci-Fi | Sci-Fi | Arcade,The Digital Fix,20,The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is an abomination on every level: a dull cynical and irreparably flawed mess which is as mindless and soulless as its antagonists.
New World Order,PC,Mar-18-2003,Termite Games,Action | Shooter | Shooter | First-Person | Modern | Tactical | Modern | Arcade,Deeko,20,With 12 missions of choppy impossible to play through graphics enemy AI which is apparently psychic and sound that is just plain bad New World Order isnt a game you want in your library... or home... or state.
The Expendables 2 Videogame,Xbox 360,Aug-17-2012,ZootFly,Action | General | Shooter | Third-Person | Shoot-'Em-Up | Modern | Top-Down,Official Xbox Magazine,30,Its often difficult to tell where your characters bullets are heading and sometimes tough to see if environmental elements are being affected by your gunfire both of which are vital in a shooter.
Jenga World Tour,DS,Nov-13-2007,Atomic Planet Entertainment,Miscellaneous | Puzzle | Party | General,PTGamers,20,Jenga is here just to fill the gap with no attention to quality whatsoever only to make a quick buck at the expense of distracted fans.
Fighters Uncaged,Xbox 360,Nov-4-2010,Ubisoft,Action | Fighting | Fighting | 3D | 3D,Eurogamer,20,To make matters worse you get sent back to a tedious menu screen every single time you learn one of the hundreds of thousands of stupid moves.
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge,PSP,Nov-2-2006,Left Field Productions,Driving | Racing | Arcade | Other | Other,IGN,20,A terrible racing game and its an even worse competition game. You might as well save yourself some cash and just stab yourself in the eye.

Magus,PlayStation 3,Feb-25-2014,Aksys Games | Black Tower Studios,Action | Role-Playing | General | Action RPG,Push Square,20,Magus is not an entertaining game.

Put your time and money towards something better than this.
